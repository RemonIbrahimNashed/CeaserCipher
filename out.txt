adventure  i.  a scandal in bohemia

i.


to sherlock holmes she is always the woman. i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler. all emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. he was, i take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. he never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. they were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. and yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late irene adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

i had seen little of holmes lately. my marriage had drifted us away from each other. my own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in baker street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. he was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland. beyond these signs of his activity, however, which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, i knew little of my former friend and companion.

one night--it was on the twentieth of march, 1888--i was returning from a journey to a patient (for i had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through baker street. as i passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet, i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. his rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as i looked up, i saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. he was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. to me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. he was at work again. he had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.

his manner was not effusive. it seldom was; but he was glad, i think, to see me. with hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.

"wedlock suits you," he remarked. "i think, watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you."

"seven!" i answered.

"indeed, i should have thought a little more. just a trifle more, i fancy, watson. and in practice again, i observe. you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."

"then, how do you know?"

"i see it, i deduce it. how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?"

"my dear holmes," said i, "this is too much. you would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as i have changed my clothes i can't imagine how you deduce it. as to mary jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, i fail to see how you work it out."

he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.

"it is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the london slavey. as to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, i must be dull, indeed, if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession."

i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. "when i hear you give your reasons," i remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process. and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours."

"quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. "you see, but you do not observe. the distinction is clear. for example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."

"frequently."

"how often?"

"well, some hundreds of times."

"then how many are there?"

"how many? i don't know."

"quite so! you have not observed. and yet you have seen. that is just my point. now, i know that there are seventeen steps, because i have both seen and observed. by the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this." he threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. "it came by the last post," said he. "read it aloud."

the note was undated, and without either signature or address.

"there will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. this account of you we have from all quarters received. be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."

"this is indeed a mystery," i remarked. "what do you imagine that it means?"

"i have no data yet. it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. but the note itself. what do you deduce from it?"

i carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.

"the man who wrote it was presumably well to do," i remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. it is peculiarly strong and stiff."

"peculiar--that is the very word," said holmes. "it is not an english paper at all. hold it up to the light."

i did so, and saw a large "e" with a small "g," a "p," and a large "g" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.

"what do you make of that?" asked holmes.

"the name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."

"not at all. the 'g' with the small 't' stands for 'gesellschaft,' which is the german for 'company.' it is a customary contraction like our 'co.' 'p,' of course, stands for 'papier.' now for the 'eg.' let us glance at our continental gazetteer." he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. "eglow, eglonitz--here we are, egria. it is in a german-speaking country--in bohemia, not far from carlsbad. 'remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?" his eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

"the paper was made in bohemia," i said.

"precisely. and the man who wrote the note is a german. do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'this account of you we have from all quarters received.' a frenchman or russian could not have written that. it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs. it only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. and here he comes, if i am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."

as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. holmes whistled.

"a pair, by the sound," said he. "yes," he continued, glancing out of the window. "a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. a hundred and fifty guineas apiece. there's money in this case, watson, if there is nothing else."

"i think that i had better go, holmes."

"not a bit, doctor. stay where you are. i am lost without my boswell. and this promises to be interesting. it would be a pity to miss it."

"but your client--"

"never mind him. i may want your help, and so may he. here he comes. sit down in that armchair, doctor, and give us your best attention."

a slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. then there was a loud and authoritative tap.

"come in!" said holmes.

a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a hercules. his dress was rich with a richness which would, in england, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. he carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.

"you had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent. "i told you that i would call." he looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.

"pray take a seat," said holmes. "this is my friend and colleague, dr. watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. whom have i the honour to address?"

"you may address me as the count von kramm, a bohemian nobleman. i understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. if not, i should much prefer to communicate with you alone."

i rose to go, but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. "it is both, or none," said he. "you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."

the count shrugged his broad shoulders. "then i must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history."

"i promise," said holmes.

"and i."

"you will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own."

"i was aware of it," said holmes dryly.

"the circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe. to speak plainly, the matter implicates the great house of ormstein, hereditary kings of bohemia."

"i was also aware of that," murmured holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.

our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe. holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.

"if your majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "i should be better able to advise you."

the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "you are right," he cried; "i am the king. why should i attempt to conceal it?"

"why, indeed?" murmured holmes. "your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein, grand duke of cassel-felstein, and hereditary king of bohemia."

"but you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. i have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting you."

"then, pray consult," said holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

"the facts are briefly these: some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to warsaw, i made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, irene adler. the name is no doubt familiar to you."

"kindly look her up in my index, doctor," murmured holmes without opening his eyes. for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.

"let me see!" said holmes. "hum! born in new jersey in the year 1858. contralto--hum! la scala, hum! prima donna imperial opera of warsaw--yes! retired from operatic stage--ha! living in london--quite so! your majesty, as i understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back."

"precisely so. but how--"

"was there a secret marriage?"

"none."

"no legal papers or certificates?"

"none."

"then i fail to follow your majesty. if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"

"there is the writing."

"pooh, pooh! forgery."

"my private note-paper."

"stolen."

"my own seal."

"imitated."

"my photograph."

"bought."

"we were both in the photograph."

"oh, dear! that is very bad! your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion."

"i was mad--insane."

"you have compromised yourself seriously."

"i was only crown prince then. i was young. i am but thirty now."

"it must be recovered."

"we have tried and failed."

"your majesty must pay. it must be bought."

"she will not sell."

"stolen, then."

"five attempts have been made. twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. twice she has been waylaid. there has been no result."

"no sign of it?"

"absolutely none."

holmes laughed. "it is quite a pretty little problem," said he.

"but a very serious one to me," returned the king reproachfully.

"very, indeed. and what does she propose to do with the photograph?"

"to ruin me."

"but how?"

"i am about to be married."

"so i have heard."

"to clotilde lothman von saxe-meningen, second daughter of the king of scandinavia. you may know the strict principles of her family. she is herself the very soul of delicacy. a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."

"and irene adler?"

"threatens to send them the photograph. and she will do it. i know that she will do it. you do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. she has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. rather than i should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none."

"you are sure that she has not sent it yet?"

"i am sure."

"and why?"

"because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. that will be next monday."

"oh, then we have three days yet," said holmes with a yawn. "that is very fortunate, as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. your majesty will, of course, stay in london for the present?"

"certainly. you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm."

"then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."

"pray do so. i shall be all anxiety."

"then, as to money?"

"you have carte blanche."

"absolutely?"

"i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."

"and for present expenses?"

the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.

"there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes," he said.

holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.

"and mademoiselle's address?" he asked.

"is briony lodge, serpentine avenue, st. john's wood."

holmes took a note of it. "one other question," said he. "was the photograph a cabinet?"

"it was."

"then, good-night, your majesty, and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. and good-night, watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "if you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock i should like to chat this little matter over with you."

ii.


at three o'clock precisely i was at baker street, but holmes had not yet returned. the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. i sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. i was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.

it was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. accustomed as i was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, i had to look three times before i was certain that it was indeed he. with a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.

"well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.

"what is it?"

"it's quite too funny. i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning, or what i ended by doing."

"i can't imagine. i suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of miss irene adler."

"quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. i will tell you, however. i left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. i soon found briony lodge. it is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. chubb lock to the door. large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open. behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.

"i then lounged down the street and found, as i expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as i could desire about miss adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested, but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to."

"and what of irene adler?" i asked.

"oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. so say the serpentine-mews, to a man. she lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. he is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. he is a mr. godfrey norton, of the inner temple. see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. when i had listened to all they had to tell, i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.

"this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. he was a lawyer. that sounded ominous. what was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? if the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. if the latter, it was less likely. on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the temple. it was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. i fear that i bore you with these details, but i have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation."

"i am following you closely," i answered.

"i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. he was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom i had heard. he appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.

"he was in the house about half an hour, and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. of her i could see nothing. presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. as he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to gross & hankey's in regent street, and then to the church of st. monica in the edgeware road. half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'

"away they went, and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. it hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.

" 'the church of st. monica, john,' she cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'

"this was quite too good to lose, watson. i was just balancing whether i should run for it, or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but i jumped in before he could object. 'the church of st. monica,' said i, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' it was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.

"my cabby drove fast. i don't think i ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. the cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived. i paid the man and hurried into the church. there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me.

" 'thank god,' he cried. 'you'll do. come! come!'

" 'what then?' i asked.

" 'come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'

"i was half-dragged up to the altar, and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which i knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler, spinster, to godfrey norton, bachelor. it was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. it seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. the bride gave me a sovereign, and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion."

"this is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said i; "and what then?"

"well, i found my plans very seriously menaced. it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. at the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the temple, and she to her own house. 'i shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said as she left him. i heard no more. they drove away in different directions, and i went off to make my own arrangements."

"which are?"

"some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell. "i have been too busy to think of food, and i am likely to be busier still this evening. by the way, doctor, i shall want your co-operation."

"i shall be delighted."

"you don't mind breaking the law?"

"not in the least."

"nor running a chance of arrest?"

"not in a good cause."

"oh, the cause is excellent!"

"then i am your man."

"i was sure that i might rely on you."

"but what is it you wish?"

"when mrs. turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you. now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, "i must discuss it while i eat, for i have not much time. it is nearly five now. in two hours we must be on the scene of action. miss irene, or madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. we must be at briony lodge to meet her."

"and what then?"

"you must leave that to me. i have already arranged what is to occur. there is only one point on which i must insist. you must not interfere, come what may. you understand?"

"i am to be neutral?"

"to do nothing whatever. there will probably be some small unpleasantness. do not join in it. it will end in my being conveyed into the house. four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. you are to station yourself close to that open window."

"yes."

"you are to watch me, for i will be visible to you."

"yes."

"and when i raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what i give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. you quite follow me?"

"entirely."

"it is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. "it is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. your task is confined to that. when you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. you may then walk to the end of the street, and i will rejoin you in ten minutes. i hope that i have made myself clear?"

"i am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."

"precisely."

"then you may entirely rely on me."

"that is excellent. i think, perhaps, it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play."

he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded nonconformist clergyman. his broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr. john hare alone could have equalled. it was not merely that holmes changed his costume. his expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. the stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.

it was a quarter past six when we left baker street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue. it was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes' succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected. on the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.

"you see," remarked holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. the photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr. godfrey norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. now the question is, where are we to find the photograph?"

"where, indeed?"

"it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. it is cabinet size. too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress. she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched. two attempts of the sort have already been made. we may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."

"where, then?"

"her banker or her lawyer. there is that double possibility. but i am inclined to think neither. women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. why should she hand it over to anyone else? she could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. it must be where she can lay her hands upon it. it must be in her own house."

"but it has twice been burgled."

"pshaw! they did not know how to look."

"but how will you look?"

"i will not look."

"what then?"

"i will get her to show me."

"but she will refuse."

"she will not be able to. but i hear the rumble of wheels. it is her carriage. now carry out my orders to the letter."

as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge. as it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. a fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. a blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. irene adler, as i will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.

"is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.

"he is dead," cried several voices.

"no, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "but he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital."

"he's a brave fellow," said a woman. "they would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. they were a gang, and a rough one, too. ah, he's breathing now."

"he can't lie in the street. may we bring him in, marm?"

"surely. bring him into the sitting-room. there is a comfortable sofa. this way, please!"

slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room, while i still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. the lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch. i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. i hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. after all, i thought, we are not injuring her. we are but preventing her from injuring another.

holmes had sat up upon the couch, and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. a maid rushed across and threw open the window. at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "fire!" the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids--joined in a general shriek of "fire!" thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. i caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road.

"you did it very nicely, doctor," he remarked. "nothing could have been better. it is all right."

"you have the photograph?"

"i know where it is."

"and how did you find out?"

"she showed me, as i told you she would."

"i am still in the dark."

"i do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "the matter was perfectly simple. you, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. they were all engaged for the evening."

"i guessed as much."

"then, when the row broke out, i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. i rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. it is an old trick."

"that also i could fathom."

"then they carried me in. she was bound to have me in. what else could she do? and into her sitting-room, which was the very room which i suspected. it lay between that and her bedroom, and i was determined to see which. they laid me on a couch, i motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance."

"how did that help you?"

"it was all-important. when a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. it is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and i have more than once taken advantage of it. in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the arnsworth castle business. a married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. she would rush to secure it. the alarm of fire was admirably done. the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. she responded beautifully. the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. she was there in an instant, and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. when i cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and i have not seen her since. i rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. a little over-precipitance may ruin all."

"and now?" i asked.

"our quest is practically finished. i shall call with the king to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. we will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands."

"and when will you call?"

"at eight in the morning. she will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. i must wire to the king without delay."

we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door. he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:

"good-night, mister sherlock holmes."

there were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.

"i've heard that voice before," said holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. "now, i wonder who the deuce that could have been."

iii.


i slept at baker street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room.

"you have really got it!" he cried, grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.

"not yet."

"but you have hopes?"

"i have hopes."

"then, come. i am all impatience to be gone."

"we must have a cab."

"no, my brougham is waiting."

"then that will simplify matters." we descended and started off once more for briony lodge.

"irene adler is married," remarked holmes.

"married! when?"

"yesterday."

"but to whom?"

"to an english lawyer named norton."

"but she could not love him."

"i am in hopes that she does."

"and why in hopes?"

"because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance. if the lady loves her husband, she does not love your majesty. if she does not love your majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your majesty's plan."

"it is true. and yet--! well! i wish she had been of my own station! what a queen she would have made!" he relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue.

the door of briony lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.

"mr. sherlock holmes, i believe?" said she.

"i am mr. holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.

"indeed! my mistress told me that you were likely to call. she left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from charing cross for the continent."

"what!" sherlock holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. "do you mean that she has left england?"

"never to return."

"and the papers?" asked the king hoarsely. "all is lost."

"we shall see." he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the king and myself. the furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to "sherlock holmes, esq. to be left till called for." my friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:

"my dear mr. sherlock holmes,--you really did it very well. you took me in completely. until after the alarm of fire, i had not a suspicion. but then, when i found how i had betrayed myself, i began to think. i had been warned against you months ago. i had been told that, if the king employed an agent, it would certainly be you. and your address had been given me. yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. even after i became suspicious, i found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. but, you know, i have been trained as an actress myself. male costume is nothing new to me. i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. i sent john, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as i call them, and came down just as you departed.

"well, i followed you to your door, and so made sure that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr. sherlock holmes. then i, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the temple to see my husband.

"we both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. as to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. i love and am loved by a better man than he. the king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. i keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. i leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and i remain, dear mr. sherlock holmes,


"very truly yours,              
"irene norton, nee adler."

"what a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the king of bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. "did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was? would she not have made an admirable queen? is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"

"from what i have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your majesty," said holmes coldly. "i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majesty's business to a more successful conclusion."

"on the contrary, my dear sir," cried the king; "nothing could be more successful. i know that her word is inviolate. the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."

"i am glad to hear your majesty say so."

"i am immensely indebted to you. pray tell me in what way i can reward you. this ring--" he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.

"your majesty has something which i should value even more highly," said holmes.

"you have but to name it."

"this photograph!"

the king stared at him in amazement.

"irene's photograph!" he cried. "certainly, if you wish it."

"i thank your majesty. then there is no more to be done in the matter. i have the honour to wish you a very good morning." he bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.

and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia, and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. he used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but i have not heard him do it of late. and when he speaks of irene adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.

adventure  ii.  the red-headed league


i had called upon my friend, mr. sherlock holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. with an apology for my intrusion, i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.

"you could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear watson," he said cordially.

"i was afraid that you were engaged."

"so i am. very much so."

"then i can wait in the next room."

"not at all. this gentleman, mr. wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."

the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.

"try the settee," said holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. "i know, my dear watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures."

"your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," i observed.

"you will remember that i remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination."

"a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting."

"you did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. now, mr. jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time. you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. as far as i have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to. perhaps, mr. wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. i ask you not merely because my friend dr. watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. as a rule, when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events, i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."

the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. as he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, i took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.

i did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. he wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. a frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. altogether, look as i would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.

sherlock holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. "beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a freemason, that he has been in china, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, i can deduce nothing else."

mr. jabez wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.

"how, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, mr. holmes?" he asked. "how did you know, for example, that i did manual labour. it's as true as gospel, for i began as a ship's carpenter."

"your hands, my dear sir. your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. you have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed."

"well, the snuff, then, and the freemasonry?"

"i won't insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."

"ah, of course, i forgot that. but the writing?"

"what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"

"well, but china?"

"the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china. i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. that trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china. when, in addition, i see a chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple."

mr. jabez wilson laughed heavily. "well, i never!" said he. "i thought at first that you had done something clever, but i see that there was nothing in it after all."

"i begin to think, watson," said holmes, "that i make a mistake in explaining. 'omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid. can you not find the advertisement, mr. wilson?"

"yes, i have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. "here it is. this is what began it all. you just read it for yourself, sir."

i took the paper from him and read as follows:

"to the red-headed league: on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins, of lebanon, pennsylvania, u. s. a., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services. all red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. apply in person on monday, at eleven o'clock, to duncan ross, at the offices of the league, 7 pope's court, fleet street."

"what on earth does this mean?" i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.

holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. "it is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said he. "and now, mr. wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. you will first make a note, doctor, of the paper and the date."

"it is the morning chronicle of april 27, 1890. just two months ago."

"very good. now, mr. wilson?"

"well, it is just as i have been telling you, mr. sherlock holmes," said jabez wilson, mopping his forehead; "i have a small pawnbroker's business at coburg square, near the city. it's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. i used to be able to keep two assistants, but now i only keep one; and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."

"what is the name of this obliging youth?" asked sherlock holmes.

"his name is vincent spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. it's hard to say his age. i should not wish a smarter assistant, mr. holmes; and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him. but, after all, if he is satisfied, why should i put ideas in his head?"

"why, indeed? you seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price. it is not a common experience among employers in this age. i don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."

"oh, he has his faults, too," said mr. wilson. "never was such a fellow for photography. snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. that is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. there's no vice in him."

"he is still with you, i presume?"

"yes, sir. he and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all i have in the house, for i am a widower and never had any family. we live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.

"the first thing that put us out was that advertisement. spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:

" 'i wish to the lord, mr. wilson, that i was a red-headed man.'

" 'why that?' i asks.

" 'why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the league of the red-headed men. it's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money. if my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'

" 'why, what is it, then?' i asked. you see, mr. holmes, i am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. in that way i didn't know much of what was going on outside, and i was always glad of a bit of news.

" 'have you never heard of the league of the red-headed men?' he asked with his eyes open.

" 'never.'

" 'why, i wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.'

" 'and what are they worth?' i asked.

" 'oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'

"well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.

" 'tell me all about it,' said i.

" 'well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. as far as i can make out, the league was founded by an american millionaire, ezekiah hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. he was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.'

" 'but,' said i, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.'

" 'not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'you see it is really confined to londoners, and to grown men. this american had started from london when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. then, again, i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. now, if you cared to apply, mr. wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'

"now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met. vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful, so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. he was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.

"i never hope to see such a sight as that again, mr. holmes. from north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. fleet street was choked with red-headed folk, and pope's court looked like a coster's orange barrow. i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. when i saw how many were waiting, i would have given it up in despair; but spaulding would not hear of it. how he did it i could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. there was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office."

"your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. "pray continue your very interesting statement."

"there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. he said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. however, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.

" 'this is mr. jabez wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league.'

" 'and he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'he has every requirement. i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine.' he took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful. then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.

" 'it would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'you will, however, i am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' with that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until i yelled with the pain. 'there is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'i perceive that all is as it should be. but we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. i could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature.' he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. a groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.

" 'my name,' said he, 'is mr. duncan ross, and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. are you a married man, mr. wilson? have you a family?'

"i answered that i had not.

"his face fell immediately.

" 'dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! i am sorry to hear you say that. the fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'

"my face lengthened at this, mr. holmes, for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.

" 'in the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?'

" 'well, it is a little awkward, for i have a business already,' said i.

" 'oh, never mind about that, mr. wilson!' said vincent spaulding. 'i should be able to look after that for you.'

" 'what would be the hours?' i asked.

" 'ten to two.'

"now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, mr. holmes, especially thursday and friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. besides, i knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.

" 'that would suit me very well,' said i. 'and the pay?'

" 'is $4 a week.'

" 'and the work?'

" 'is purely nominal.'

" 'what do you call purely nominal?'

" 'well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. if you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. the will is very clear upon that point. you don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.'

" 'it's only four hours a day, and i should not think of leaving,' said i.

" 'no excuse will avail,' said mr. duncan ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. there you must stay, or you lose your billet.'

" 'and the work?'

" 'is to copy out the encyclopaedia britannica. there is the first volume of it in that press. you must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. will you be ready to-morrow?'

" 'certainly,' i answered.

" 'then, good-bye, mr. jabez wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.' he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, i was so pleased at my own good fortune.

"well, i thought over the matter all day, and by evening i was in low spirits again; for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be i could not imagine. it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the encyclopaedia britannica. vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. however, in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow, so i bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, i started off for pope's court.

"well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. the table was set out ready for me, and mr. duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work. he started me off upon the letter a, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. at two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that i had written, and locked the door of the office after me.

"this went on day after day, mr. holmes, and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work. it was the same next week, and the same the week after. every morning i was there at ten, and every afternoon i left at two. by degrees mr. duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. still, of course, i never dared to leave the room for an instant, for i was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that i would not risk the loss of it.

"eight weeks passed away like this, and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica, and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the b's before very long. it cost me something in foolscap, and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. and then suddenly the whole business came to an end."

"to an end?"

"yes, sir. and no later than this morning. i went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. here it is, and you can read for yourself."

he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. it read in this fashion:


the red-headed league

is

dissolved.

october 9, 1890.


sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.

"i cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "if you can do nothing better than laugh at me, i can go elsewhere."

"no, no," cried holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "i really wouldn't miss your case for the world. it is most refreshingly unusual. but there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"

"i was staggered, sir. i did not know what to do. then i called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. finally, i went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the red-headed league. he said that he had never heard of any such body. then i asked him who mr. duncan ross was. he answered that the name was new to him.

" 'well,' said i, 'the gentleman at no. 4.'

" 'what, the red-headed man?'

" 'yes.'

" 'oh,' said he, 'his name was william morris. he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. he moved out yesterday.'

" 'where could i find him?'

" 'oh, at his new offices. he did tell me the address. yes, 17 king edward street, near st. paul's.'

"i started off, mr. holmes, but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either mr. william morris or mr. duncan ross."

"and what did you do then?" asked holmes.

"i went home to saxe-coburg square, and i took the advice of my assistant. but he could not help me in any way. he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post. but that was not quite good enough, mr. holmes. i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, i came right away to you."

"and you did very wisely," said holmes. "your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and i shall be happy to look into it. from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."

"grave enough!" said mr. jabez wilson. "why, i have lost four pound a week."

"as far as you are personally concerned," remarked holmes, "i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. on the contrary, you are, as i understand, richer by some $30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a. you have lost nothing by them."

"no, sir. but i want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. it was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds."

"we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. and, first, one or two questions, mr. wilson. this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?"

"about a month then."

"how did he come?"

"in answer to an advertisement."

"was he the only applicant?"

"no, i had a dozen."

"why did you pick him?"

"because he was handy and would come cheap."

"at half wages, in fact."

"yes."

"what is he like, this vincent spaulding?"

"small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."

holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "i thought as much," said he. "have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"

"yes, sir. he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad."

"hum!" said holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "he is still with you?"

"oh, yes, sir; i have only just left him."

"and has your business been attended to in your absence?"

"nothing to complain of, sir. there's never very much to do of a morning."

"that will do, mr. wilson. i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. to-day is saturday, and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion."

"well, watson," said holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"

"i make nothing of it," i answered frankly. "it is a most mysterious business."

"as a rule," said holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. it is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. but i must be prompt over this matter."

"what are you going to do, then?" i asked.

"to smoke," he answered. "it is quite a three pipe problem, and i beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." he curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

"sarasate plays at the st. james's hall this afternoon," he remarked. "what do you think, watson? could your patients spare you for a few hours?"

"i have nothing to do to-day. my practice is never very absorbing."

"then put on your hat and come. i am going through the city first, and we can have some lunch on the way. i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than italian or french. it is introspective, and i want to introspect. come along!"

we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate; and a short walk took us to saxe-coburg square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. it was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. three gilt balls and a brown board with "jabez wilson" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. it was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.

"thank you," said holmes, "i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand."

"third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.

"smart fellow, that," observed holmes as we walked away. "he is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in london, and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. i have known something of him before."

"evidently," said i, "mr. wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the red-headed league. i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."

"not him."

"what then?"

"the knees of his trousers."

"and what did you see?"

"what i expected to see."

"why did you beat the pavement?"

"my dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. we are spies in an enemy's country. we know something of saxe-coburg square. let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."

the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxe-coburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west. the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.

"let me see," said holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "i should like just to remember the order of the houses here. it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london. there is mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank, the vegetarian restaurant, and mcfarlane's carriage-building depot. that carries us right on to the other block. and now, doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. a sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."

my friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuth-hound, holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as i have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as i knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st. james's hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.

"you want to go home, no doubt, doctor," he remarked as we emerged.

"yes, it would be as well."

"and i have some business to do which will take some hours. this business at coburg square is serious."

"why serious?"

"a considerable crime is in contemplation. i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. but to-day being saturday rather complicates matters. i shall want your help to-night."

"at what time?"

"ten will be early enough."

"i shall be at baker street at ten."

"very well. and, i say, doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." he waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.

i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours, but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes. here i had heard what he had heard, i had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the encyclopaedia down to the visit to saxe-coburg square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. what was this nocturnal expedition, and why should i go armed? where were we going, and what were we to do? i had the hint from holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. i tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.

it was a quarter-past nine when i started from home and made my way across the park, and so through oxford street to baker street. two hansoms were standing at the door, and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above. on entering his room, i found holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom i recognised as peter jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.

"ha! our party is complete," said holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. "watson, i think you know mr. jones, of scotland yard? let me introduce you to mr. merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."

"we're hunting in couples again, doctor, you see," said jones in his consequential way. "our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down."

"i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase," observed mr. merryweather gloomily.

"you may place considerable confidence in mr. holmes, sir," said the police agent loftily. "he has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. it is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force."

"oh, if you say so, mr. jones, it is all right," said the stranger with deference. "still, i confess that i miss my rubber. it is the first saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that i have not had my rubber."

"i think you will find," said sherlock holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. for you, mr. merryweather, the stake will be some $30,000; and for you, jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."

"john clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. he's a young man, mr. merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london. he's a remarkable man, is young john clay. his grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to eton and oxford. his brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. he'll crack a crib in scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next. i've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet."

"i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. i've had one or two little turns also with mr. john clay, and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. it is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. if you two will take the first hansom, watson and i will follow in the second."

sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into farrington street.

"we are close there now," my friend remarked. "this fellow merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. i thought it as well to have jones with us also. he is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. he has one positive virtue. he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. here we are, and they are waiting for us."

we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of mr. merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. this also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. mr. merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.

"you are not very vulnerable from above," holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.

"nor from below," said mr. merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. "why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.

"i must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said holmes severely. "you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"

the solemn mr. merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.

"we have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. we are at present, doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks. mr. merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."

"it is our french gold," whispered the director. "we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."

"your french gold?"

"yes. we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the bank of france. it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. the crate upon which i sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."

"which were very well justified," observed holmes. "and now it is time that we arranged our little plans. i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. in the meantime mr. merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."

"and sit in the dark?"

"i am afraid so. i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and i thought that, as we were a partie carree, you might have your rubber after all. but i see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. and, first of all, we must choose our positions. these are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. i shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. then, when i flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. if they fire, watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."

i placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched. holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced. the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. to me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.

"they have but one retreat," whispered holmes. "that is back through the house into saxe-coburg square. i hope that you have done what i asked you, jones?"

"i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."

"then we have stopped all the holes. and now we must be silent and wait."

what a time it seemed! from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. my limbs were weary and stiff, for i feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but i could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor. suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.

at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. for a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.

its disappearance, however, was but momentary. with a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.

"it's all clear," he whispered. "have you the chisel and the bags? great scott! jump, archie, jump, and i'll swing for it!"

sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. the other dived down the hole, and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts. the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.

"it's no use, john clay," said holmes blandly. "you have no chance at all."

"so i see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "i fancy that my pal is all right, though i see you have got his coat-tails."

"there are three men waiting for him at the door," said holmes.

"oh, indeed! you seem to have done the thing very completely. i must compliment you."

"and i you," holmes answered. "your red-headed idea was very new and effective."

"you'll see your pal again presently," said jones. "he's quicker at climbing down holes than i am. just hold out while i fix the derbies."

"i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. "you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins. have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please.' "

"all right," said jones with a stare and a snigger. "well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police-station?"

"that is better," said john clay serenely. he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.

"really, mr. holmes," said mr. merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, "i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."

"i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr. john clay," said holmes. "i have been at some small expense over this matter, which i shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red-headed league."

"you see, watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league, and the copying of the encyclopaedia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. it was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. the method was no doubt suggested to clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. the $4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? they put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."

"but how could you guess what the motive was?"

"had there been women in the house, i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. that, however, was out of the question. the man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. it must, then, be something out of the house. what could it be? i thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. the cellar! there was the end of this tangled clue. then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london. he was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. what could it be, once more? i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.

"so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action. i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. it was not in front. then i rang the bell, and, as i hoped, the assistant answered it. we have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. i hardly looked at his face. his knees were what i wished to see. you must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. they spoke of those hours of burrowing. the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. i walked round the corner, saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that i had solved my problem. when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."

"and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?" i asked.

"well, when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr. jabez wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. but it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. for all these reasons i expected them to come to-night."

"you reasoned it out beautifully," i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "it is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true."

"it saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "alas! i already feel it closing in upon me. my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. these little problems help me to do so."

"and you are a benefactor of the race," said i.

he shrugged his shoulders. "well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use," he remarked. " 'l'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand."

adventure  iii.  a case of identity


"my dear fellow," said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. if we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable."

"and yet i am not convinced of it," i answered. "the cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic."

"a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked holmes. "this is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."

i smiled and shook my head. "i can quite understand your thinking so." i said. "of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. but here"--i picked up the morning paper from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. here is the first heading upon which i come. 'a husband's cruelty to his wife.' there is half a column of print, but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. there is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude."

"indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "this is the dundas separation case, and, as it happens, i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. the husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. take a pinch of snuff, doctor, and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your example."

he held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it.

"ah," said he, "i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks. it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers."

"and the ring?" i asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.

"it was from the reigning family of holland, though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems."

"and have you any on hand just now?" i asked with interest.

"some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. they are important, you understand, without being interesting. indeed, i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. in these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. it is possible, however, that i may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or i am much mistaken."

he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted london street. looking over his shoulder, i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear. from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.

"i have seen those symptoms before," said holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. "oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. she would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. and yet even here we may discriminate. when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."

as he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.

"do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?"

"i did at first," she answered, "but now i know where the letters are without looking." then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "you've heard about me, mr. holmes," she cried, "else how could you know all that?"

"never mind," said holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know things. perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook. if not, why should you come to consult me?"

"i came to you, sir, because i heard of you from mrs. etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. oh, mr. holmes, i wish you would do as much for me. i'm not rich, but still i have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that i make by the machine, and i would give it all to know what has become of mr. hosmer angel."

"why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked sherlock holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.

again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland. "yes, i did bang out of the house," she said, "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr. windibank--that is, my father--took it all. he would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and i just on with my things and came right away to you."

"your father," said holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the name is different."

"yes, my stepfather. i call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."

"and your mother is alive?"

"oh, yes, mother is alive and well. i wasn't best pleased, mr. holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. father was a plumber in the tottenham court road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with mr. hardy, the foreman; but when mr. windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. they got $4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."

i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.

"your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the business?"

"oh, no, sir. it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland. it is in new zealand stock, paying 4 1/4 per cent. two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but i can only touch the interest."

"you interest me extremely," said holmes. "and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about $60."

"i could do with much less than that, mr. holmes, but you understand that as long as i live at home i don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them. of course, that is only just for the time. mr. windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting. it brings me twopence a sheet, and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."

"you have made your position very clear to me," said holmes. "this is my friend, dr. watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr. hosmer angel."

a flush stole over miss sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "i met him first at the gasfitters' ball," she said. "they used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. mr. windibank did not wish us to go. he never did wish us to go anywhere. he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sunday-school treat. but this time i was set on going, and i would go; for what right had he to prevent? he said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. and he said that i had nothing fit to wear, when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer. at last, when nothing else would do, he went off to france upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and i, with mr. hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there i met mr. hosmer angel."

"i suppose," said holmes, "that when mr. windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."

"oh, well, he was very good about it. he laughed, i remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way."

"i see. then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as i understand, a gentleman called mr. hosmer angel."

"yes, sir. i met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, mr. holmes, i met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and mr. hosmer angel could not come to the house any more."

"no?"

"well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. he wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. but then, as i used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and i had not got mine yet."

"but how about mr. hosmer angel? did he make no attempt to see you?"

"well, father was going off to france again in a week, and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. we could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. i took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know."

"were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"

"oh, yes, mr. holmes. we were engaged after the first walk that we took. hosmer--mr. angel--was a cashier in an office in leadenhall street--and--"

"what office?"

"that's the worst of it, mr. holmes, i don't know."

"where did he live, then?"

"he slept on the premises."

"and you don't know his address?"

"no--except that it was leadenhall street."

"where did you address your letters, then?"

"to the leadenhall street post office, to be left till called for. he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so i offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. that will just show you how fond he was of me, mr. holmes, and the little things that he would think of."

"it was most suggestive," said holmes. "it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. can you remember any other little things about mr. hosmer angel?"

"he was a very shy man, mr. holmes. he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. very retiring and gentlemanly he was. even his voice was gentle. he'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. he was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."

"well, and what happened when mr. windibank, your stepfather, returned to france?"

"mr. hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the testament, that whatever happened i would always be true to him. mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was. then, when they talked of marrying within the week, i began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. i didn't quite like that, mr. holmes. it seemed funny that i should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but i didn't want to do anything on the sly, so i wrote to father at bordeaux, where the company has its french offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding."

"it missed him, then?"

"yes, sir; for he had started to england just before it arrived."

"ha! that was unfortunate. your wedding was arranged, then, for the friday. was it to be in church?"

"yes, sir, but very quietly. it was to be at st. saviour's, near king's cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st. pancras hotel. hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. we got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. that was last friday, mr. holmes, and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him."

"it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said holmes.

"oh, no, sir! he was too good and kind to leave me so. why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, i was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, i was always to remember that i was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. it seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it."

"most certainly it does. your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"

"yes, sir. i believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. and then i think that what he foresaw happened."

"but you have no notion as to what it could have been?"

"none."

"one more question. how did your mother take the matter?"

"she was angry, and said that i was never to speak of the matter again."

"and your father? did you tell him?"

"yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that i should hear of hosmer again. as he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. and yet, what could have happened? and why could he not write? oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and i can't sleep a wink at night." she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.

"i shall glance into the case for you," said holmes, rising, "and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. above all, try to let mr. hosmer angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."

"then you don't think i'll see him again?"

"i fear not."

"then what has happened to him?"

"you will leave that question in my hands. i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare."

"i advertised for him in last saturday's chronicle," said she. "here is the slip and here are four letters from him."

"thank you. and your address?"

"no. 31 lyon place, camberwell."

"mr. angel's address you never had, i understand. where is your father's place of business?"

"he travels for westhouse & marbank, the great claret importers of fenchurch street."

"thank you. you have made your statement very clearly. you will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which i have given you. let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life."

"you are very kind, mr. holmes, but i cannot do that. i shall be true to hosmer. he shall find me ready when he comes back."

for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.

sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.

"quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "i found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. you will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at the hague last year. old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. but the maiden herself was most instructive."

"you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me," i remarked.

"not invisible but unnoticed, watson. you did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. i can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? describe it."

"well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. her boots i didn't observe. she had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way."

sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.

" 'pon my word, watson, you are coming along wonderfully. you have really done very well indeed. it is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. my first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. as you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. the double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. the sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. i then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, i ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."

"it surprised me."

"but, surely, it was obvious. i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."

"and what else?" i asked, keenly interested, as i always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.

"i noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. it must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. all this is amusing, though rather elementary, but i must go back to business, watson. would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr. hosmer angel?"

i held the little printed slip to the light.

"missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named hosmer angel. about five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold albert chain, and grey harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. known to have been employed in an office in leadenhall street. anybody bringing--"

"that will do," said holmes. "as to the letters," he continued, glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. absolutely no clue in them to mr. angel, save that he quotes balzac once. there is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you."

"they are typewritten," i remarked.

"not only that, but the signature is typewritten. look at the neat little 'hosmer angel' at the bottom. there is a date, you see, but no superscription except leadenhall street, which is rather vague. the point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive."

"of what?"

"my dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?"

"i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted."

"no, that was not the point. however, i shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. one is to a firm in the city, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, mr. windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening. it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. and now, doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim."

i had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. once only had i known him to fail, in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph; but when i looked back to the weird business of the sign of four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the study in scarlet, i felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.

i left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland.

a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. it was not until close upon six o'clock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street, half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the denouement of the little mystery. i found sherlock holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. a formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.

"well, have you solved it?" i asked as i entered.

"yes. it was the bisulphate of baryta."

"no, no, the mystery!" i cried.

"oh, that! i thought of the salt that i have been working upon. there was never any mystery in the matter, though, as i said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. the only drawback is that there is no law, i fear, that can touch the scoundrel."

"who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland?"

the question was hardly out of my mouth, and holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.

"this is the girl's stepfather, mr. james windibank," said holmes. "he has written to me to say that he would be here at six. come in!"

the man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. he shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.

"good-evening, mr. james windibank," said holmes. "i think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?"

"yes, sir. i am afraid that i am a little late, but i am not quite my own master, you know. i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. it was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. of course, i did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel?"

"on the contrary," said holmes quietly; "i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr. hosmer angel."

mr. windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "i am delighted to hear it," he said.

"it is a curious thing," remarked holmes, "that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. now, you remark in this note of yours, mr. windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' there are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious."

"we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes.

"and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study, mr. windibank," holmes continued. "i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention. i have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. they are all typewritten. in each case, not only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well."

mr. windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, mr. holmes," he said. "if you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it."

"certainly," said holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. "i let you know, then, that i have caught him!"

"what! where?" shouted mr. windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.

"oh, it won't do--really it won't," said holmes suavely. "there is no possible getting out of it, mr. windibank. it is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. that's right! sit down and let us talk it over."

our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. "it--it's not actionable," he stammered.

"i am very much afraid that it is not. but between ourselves, windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if i go wrong."

the man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.

"the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. it was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. it was worth an effort to preserve it. the daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. but soon he found that that would not answer forever. she became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. what does her clever stepfather do then? he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as mr. hosmer angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself."

"it was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "we never thought that she would have been so carried away."

"very likely not. however that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. she was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. then mr. angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. there were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. but the deception could not be kept up forever. these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous. the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. as far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. i think that was the chain of events, mr. windibank!"

our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.

"it may be so, or it may not, mr. holmes," said he, "but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. i have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint."

"the law cannot, as you say, touch you," said holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. if the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. by jove!" he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop handy, and i think i shall just treat myself to--" he took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see mr. james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.

"there's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. "that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. the case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest."

"i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," i remarked.

"well, of course it was obvious from the first that this mr. hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. you see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction."

"and how did you verify them?"

"having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. i knew the firm for which this man worked. having taken the printed description. i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and i sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. i had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. as i expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. the same post brought me a letter from westhouse & marbank, of fenchurch street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employe, james windibank. voila tout!"

"and miss sutherland?"

"if i tell her she will not believe me. you may remember the old persian saying, 'there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace, and as much knowledge of the world."

adventure iv. the boscombe valley mystery


we were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and i, when the maid brought in a telegram. it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way:

"have you a couple of days to spare? have just been wired for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy. shall be glad if you will come with me. air and scenery perfect. leave paddington by the 11:15."

"what do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me. "will you go?"

"i really don't know what to say. i have a fairly long list at present."

"oh, anstruther would do your work for you. you have been looking a little pale lately. i think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in mr. sherlock holmes' cases."

"i should be ungrateful if i were not, seeing what i gained through one of them," i answered. "but if i am to go, i must pack at once, for i have only half an hour."

my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. my wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to paddington station. sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.

"it is really very good of you to come, watson," said he. "it makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely. local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets."

we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him. among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past reading. then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.

"have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.

"not a word. i have not seen a paper for some days."

"the london press has not had very full accounts. i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. it seems, from what i gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult."

"that sounds a little paradoxical."

"but it is profoundly true. singularity is almost invariably a clue. the more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. in this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man."

"it is a murder, then?"

"well, it is conjectured to be so. i shall take nothing for granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it. i will explain the state of things to you, as far as i have been able to understand it, in a very few words.

"boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross, in herefordshire. the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr. john turner, who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to the old country. one of the farms which he held, that of hatherley, was let to mr. charles mccarthy, who was also an ex-australian. the men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. turner was apparently the richer man, so mccarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. mccarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives, though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. mccarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl. turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families. now for the facts.

"on june 3rd, that is, on monday last, mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley. he had been out with his serving-man in the morning at ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. from that appointment he never came back alive.

"from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. one was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was william crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of mr. turner. both these witnesses depose that mr. mccarthy was walking alone. the game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr. mccarthy pass he had seen his son, mr. james mccarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. to the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.

"the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. a girl of fourteen, patience moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the boscombe valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. she states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, mr. mccarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. she heard mr. mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. she had hardly said the words when young mr. mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. he was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on tuesday, he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross, who have referred the case to the next assizes. those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court."

"i could hardly imagine a more damning case," i remarked. "if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here."

"circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered holmes thoughtfully. "it may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. it must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. there are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them miss turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home."

"i am afraid," said i, "that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case."

"there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he answered, laughing. "besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr. lestrade. you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. to take the first example to hand, i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet i question whether mr. lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that."

"how on earth--"

"my dear fellow, i know you well. i know the military neatness which characterises you. you shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. therein lies my metier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering."

"what are they?"

"it appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to hatherley farm. on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury."

"it was a confession," i ejaculated.

"no, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."

"coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark."

"on the contrary," said holmes, "it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds. however innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. as to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. the self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one."

i shook my head. "many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence," i remarked.

"so they have. and many men have been wrongfully hanged."

"what is the young man's own account of the matter?"

"it is, i am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. you will find it here, and may read it for yourself."

he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. it ran in this way:

"mr. james mccarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: 'i had been away from home for three days at bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday, the 3rd. my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb, the groom. shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though i was not aware in which direction he was going. i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. on my way i saw william crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father. i had no idea that he was in front of me. when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of "cooee!" which was a usual signal between my father and myself. i then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there. a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, i left him and returned towards hatherley farm. i had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when i heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. i found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. i dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. i knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to mr. turner's lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. i saw no one near my father when i returned, and i have no idea how he came by his injuries. he was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as i know, no active enemies. i know nothing further of the matter.'

"the coroner: did your father make any statement to you before he died?

"witness: he mumbled a few words, but i could only catch some allusion to a rat.

"the coroner: what did you understand by that?

"witness: it conveyed no meaning to me. i thought that he was delirious.

"the coroner: what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?

"witness: i should prefer not to answer.

"the coroner: i am afraid that i must press it.

"witness: it is really impossible for me to tell you. i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.

"the coroner: that is for the court to decide. i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.

"witness: i must still refuse.

"the coroner: i understand that the cry of 'cooee' was a common signal between you and your father?

"witness: it was.

"the coroner: how was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol?

"witness (with considerable confusion): i do not know.

"a juryman: did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?

"witness: nothing definite.

"the coroner: what do you mean?

"witness: i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open, that i could think of nothing except of my father. yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. it seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. when i rose from my father i looked round for it, but it was gone.

" 'do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'

" 'yes, it was gone.'

" 'you cannot say what it was?'

" 'no, i had a feeling something was there.'

" 'how far from the body?'

" 'a dozen yards or so.'

" 'and how far from the edge of the wood?'

" 'about the same.'

" 'then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?'

" 'yes, but with my back towards it.'

"this concluded the examination of the witness."

"i see," said i as i glanced down the column, "that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy. he calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father's dying words. they are all, as he remarks, very much against the son."

holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. "both you and the coroner have been at some pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour. don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. no, sir, i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. and now here is my pocket petrarch, and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action. we lunch at swindon, and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes."

it was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful stroud valley, and over the broad gleaming severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of ross. a lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade, of scotland yard. with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us.

"i have ordered a carriage," said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. "i knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."

"it was very nice and complimentary of you," holmes answered. "it is entirely a question of barometric pressure."

lestrade looked startled. "i do not quite follow," he said.

"how is the glass? twenty-nine, i see. no wind, and not a cloud in the sky. i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage to-night."

lestrade laughed indulgently. "you have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "the case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. she has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done. why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door."

he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life. her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.

"oh, mr. sherlock holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "i am so glad that you have come. i have driven down to tell you so. i know that james didn't do it. i know it, and i want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. never let yourself doubt upon that point. we have known each other since we were little children, and i know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."

"i hope we may clear him, miss turner," said sherlock holmes. "you may rely upon my doing all that i can."

"but you have read the evidence. you have formed some conclusion? do you not see some loophole, some flaw? do you not yourself think that he is innocent?"

"i think that it is very probable."

"there, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade. "you hear! he gives me hopes."

lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.

"but he is right. oh! i know that he is right. james never did it. and about his quarrel with his father, i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it."

"in what way?" asked holmes.

"it is no time for me to hide anything. james and his father had many disagreements about me. mr. mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. so there were quarrels, and this, i am sure, was one of them."

"and your father?" asked holmes. "was he in favour of such a union?"

"no, he was averse to it also. no one but mr. mccarthy was in favour of it." a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.

"thank you for this information," said he. "may i see your father if i call to-morrow?"

"i am afraid the doctor won't allow it."

"the doctor?"

"yes, have you not heard? poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. he has taken to his bed, and dr. willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. mr. mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria."

"ha! in victoria! that is important."

"yes, at the mines."

"quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as i understand, mr. turner made his money."

"yes, certainly."

"thank you, miss turner. you have been of material assistance to me."

"you will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. no doubt you will go to the prison to see james. oh, if you do, mr. holmes, do tell him that i know him to be innocent."

"i will, miss turner."

"i must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if i leave him. good-bye, and god help you in your undertaking." she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.

"i am ashamed of you, holmes," said lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence. "why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? i am not over-tender of heart, but i call it cruel."

"i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy," said holmes. "have you an order to see him in prison?"

"yes, but only for you and me."

"then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out. we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him to-night?"

"ample."

"then let us do so. watson, i fear that you will find it very slow, but i shall only be away a couple of hours."

i walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. the puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and i found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that i at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. supposing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? it was something terrible and deadly. what could it be? might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. in the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. i marked the spot upon my own head. clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. that was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. still, it might be worth while to call holmes' attention to it. then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. what could that mean? it could not be delirium. a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. no, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. but what could it indicate? i cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. and then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy. if that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! i did not wonder at lestrade's opinion, and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes' insight that i could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthy's innocence.

it was late before sherlock holmes returned. he came back alone, for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.

"the glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down. "it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. on the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and i did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. i have seen young mccarthy."

"and what did you learn from him?"

"nothing."

"could he throw no light?"

"none at all. i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. he is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, i should think, sound at heart."

"i cannot admire his taste," i remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss turner."

"ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. this fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office? no one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to miss turner. on the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol, and his father did not know where he was. mark that point. it is of importance. good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered."

"but if he is innocent, who has done it?"

"ah! who? i would call your attention very particularly to two points. one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry 'cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. and now let us talk about george meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow."

there was no rain, as holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. at nine o'clock lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool.

"there is serious news this morning," lestrade observed. "it is said that mr. turner, of the hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of."

"an elderly man, i presume?" said holmes.

"about sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. this business has had a very bad effect upon him. he was an old friend of mccarthy's, and, i may add, a great benefactor to him, for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free."

"indeed! that is interesting," said holmes.

"oh, yes! in a hundred other ways he has helped him. everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him."

"really! does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to turner, should still talk of marrying his son to turner's daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? it is the more strange, since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea. the daughter told us as much. do you not deduce something from that?"

"we have got to the deductions and the inferences," said lestrade, winking at me. "i find it hard enough to tackle facts, holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."

"you are right," said holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard to tackle the facts."

"anyhow, i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of," replied lestrade with some warmth.

"and that is--"

"that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."

"well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said holmes, laughing. "but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left."

"yes, that is it." it was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. we called at the door, when the maid, at holmes' request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son's, though not the pair which he had then had. having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool.

sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him. his face flushed and darkened. his brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. his face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool. it was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. sometimes holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. lestrade and i walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.

the boscombe pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr. turner. above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling. on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. to holmes, as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. he ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.

"what did you go into the pool for?" he asked.

"i fished about with a rake. i thought there might be some weapon or other trace. but how on earth--"

"oh, tut, tut! i have no time! that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. a mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. oh, how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. but here are three separate tracks of the same feet." he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. "these are young mccarthy's feet. twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. that bears out his story. he ran when he saw his father on the ground. then here are the father's feet as he paced up and down. what is this, then? it is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. and this? ha, ha! what have we here? tiptoes! tiptoes! square, too, quite unusual boots! they come, they go, they come again--of course that was for the cloak. now where did they come from?" he ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. for a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. a jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.

"it has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked, returning to his natural manner. "i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. i think that i will go in and have a word with moran, and perhaps write a little note. having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. you may walk to the cab, and i shall be with you presently."

it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into ross, holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.

"this may interest you, lestrade," he remarked, holding it out. "the murder was done with it."

"i see no marks."

"there are none."

"how do you know, then?"

"the grass was growing under it. it had only lain there a few days. there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. it corresponds with the injuries. there is no sign of any other weapon."

"and the murderer?"

"is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. there are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."

lestrade laughed. "i am afraid that i am still a sceptic," he said. "theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed british jury."

"nous verrons," answered holmes calmly. "you work your own method, and i shall work mine. i shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to london by the evening train."

"and leave your case unfinished?"

"no, finished."

"but the mystery?"

"it is solved."

"who was the criminal, then?"

"the gentleman i describe."

"but who is he?"

"surely it would not be difficult to find out. this is not such a populous neighbourhood."

lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "i am a practical man," he said, "and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. i should become the laughing-stock of scotland yard."

"all right," said holmes quietly. "i have given you the chance. here are your lodgings. good-bye. i shall drop you a line before i leave."

having left lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.

"look here, watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. i don't know quite what to do, and i should value your advice. light a cigar and let me expound."

"pray do so."

"well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. one was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry 'cooee!' before seeing him. the other was his singular dying reference to a rat. he mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son's ear. now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."

"what of this 'cooee!' then?"

"well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. the son, as far as he knew, was in bristol. it was mere chance that he was within earshot. the 'cooee!' was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. but 'cooee' is a distinctly australian cry, and one which is used between australians. there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia."

"what of the rat, then?"

sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. "this is a map of the colony of victoria," he said. "i wired to bristol for it last night." he put his hand over part of the map. "what do you read?"

"arat," i read.

"and now?" he raised his hand.

"ballarat."

"quite so. that was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. he was trying to utter the name of his murderer. so and so, of ballarat."

"it is wonderful!" i exclaimed.

"it is obvious. and now, you see, i had narrowed the field down considerably. the possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a certainty. we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak."

"certainly."

"and one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander."

"quite so."

"then comes our expedition of to-day. by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal."

"but how did you gain them?"

"you know my method. it is founded upon the observation of trifles."

"his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. his boots, too, might be told from their traces."

"yes, they were peculiar boots."

"but his lameness?"

"the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. he put less weight upon it. why? because he limped--he was lame."

"but his left-handedness."

"you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. the blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. he had even smoked there. i found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar. i have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. having found the ash, i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. it was an indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam."

"and the cigar-holder?"

"i could see that the end had not been in his mouth. therefore he used a holder. the tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so i deduced a blunt pen-knife."

"holmes," i said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. i see the direction in which all this points. the culprit is--"

"mr. john turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.

the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. his slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. his tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. it was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.

"pray sit down on the sofa," said holmes gently. "you had my note?"

"yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal."

"i thought people would talk if i went to the hall."

"and why did you wish to see me?" he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.

"yes," said holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "it is so. i know all about mccarthy."

the old man sank his face in his hands. "god help me!" he cried. "but i would not have let the young man come to harm. i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes."

"i am glad to hear you say so," said holmes gravely.

"i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. it would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested."

"it may not come to that," said holmes.

"what?"

"i am no official agent. i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and i am acting in her interests. young mccarthy must be got off, however."

"i am a dying man," said old turner. "i have had diabetes for years. my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month. yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."

holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. "just tell us the truth," he said. "i shall jot down the facts. you will sign it, and watson here can witness it. then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy. i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed."

"it's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether i shall live to the assizes, so it matters little to me, but i should wish to spare alice the shock. and now i will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.

"you didn't know this dead man, mccarthy. he was a devil incarnate. i tell you that. god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. his grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. i'll tell you first how i came to be in his power.

"it was in the early '60's at the diggings. i was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; i got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. there were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. black jack of ballarat was the name i went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang.

"one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. there were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. i put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man mccarthy. i wish to the lord that i had shot him then, but i spared him, though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. we got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to england without being suspected. there i parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. i bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and i set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which i had earned it. i married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice. even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. in a word, i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me.

"i had gone up to town about an investment, and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.

" 'here we are, jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be as good as a family to you. there's two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. if you don't--it's a fine, law-abiding country is england, and there's always a policeman within hail.'

"well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. there was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where i would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. it grew worse as alice grew up, for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was i gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which i could not give. he asked for alice.

"his son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as i was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. but there i was firm. i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that i had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. i stood firm. mccarthy threatened. i braved him to do his worst. we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.

"when i went down there i found him talking with his son, so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. could i not snap the bond? i was already a dying and a desperate man. though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, i knew that my own fate was sealed. but my memory and my girl! both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue. i did it, mr. holmes. i would do it again. deeply as i have sinned, i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than i could suffer. i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. his cry brought back his son; but i had gained the cover of the wood, though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight. that is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred."

"well, it is not for me to judge you," said holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. "i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation."

"i pray not, sir. and what do you intend to do?"

"in view of your health, nothing. you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes. i will keep your confession, and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be forced to use it. if not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us."

"farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine." tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.

"god help us!" said holmes after a long silence. "why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxter's words, and say, 'there, but for the grace of god, goes sherlock holmes.' "

james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. old turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.

adventure  v.  the five orange pips


when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes cases between the years '82 and '90, i am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. there is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.

the year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which i retain the records. among my headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber, of the amateur mendicant society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the british barque sophy anderson, of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa, and finally of the camberwell poisoning case. in the latter, as may be remembered, sherlock holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. all these i may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe.

it was in the latter days of september, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. as evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while i at the other was deep in one of clark russell's fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. my wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street.

"why," said i, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the bell. who could come to-night? some friend of yours, perhaps?"

"except yourself i have none," he answered. "i do not encourage visitors."

"a client, then?"

"if so, it is a serious case. nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady's."

sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. he stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.

"come in!" said he.

the man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. he looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and i could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.

"i owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. "i trust that i am not intruding. i fear that i have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber."

"give me your coat and umbrella," said holmes. "they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently. you have come up from the south-west, i see."

"yes, from horsham."

"that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive."

"i have come for advice."

"that is easily got."

"and help."

"that is not always so easy."

"i have heard of you, mr. holmes. i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal."

"ah, of course. he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."

"he said that you could solve anything."

"he said too much."

"that you are never beaten."

"i have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a woman."

"but what is that compared with the number of your successes?"

"it is true that i have been generally successful."

"then you may be so with me."

"i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case."

"it is no ordinary one."

"none of those which come to me are. i am the last court of appeal."

"and yet i question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family."

"you fill me with interest," said holmes. "pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and i can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important."

the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.

"my name," said he, "is john openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as i can understand, little to do with this awful business. it is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, i must go back to the commencement of the affair.

"you must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle elias and my father joseph. my father had a small factory at coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. he was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.

"my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and became a planter in florida, where he was reported to have done very well. at the time of the war he fought in jackson's army, and afterwards under hood, where he rose to be a colonel. when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. about 1869 or 1870 he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex, near horsham. he had made a very considerable fortune in the states, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them. he was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. during all the years that he lived at horsham, i doubt if ever he set foot in the town. he had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.

"he didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so. this would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in england. he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house. i kept all the keys and could go where i liked and do what i liked, so long as i did not disturb him in his privacy. there was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. with a boy's curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole, but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.

"one day--it was in march, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. it was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'from india!' said he as he took it up, 'pondicherry postmark! what can this be?' opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. i began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. his lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, 'k. k. k.!' he shrieked, and then, 'my god, my god, my sins have overtaken me!'

" 'what is it, uncle?' i cried.

" 'death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. i took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter k three times repeated. there was nothing else save the five dried pips. what could be the reason of his overpowering terror? i left the breakfast-table, and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.

" 'they may do what they like, but i'll checkmate them still,' said he with an oath. 'tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to fordham, the horsham lawyer.'

"i did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room. the fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. as i glanced at the box i noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the envelope.

" 'i wish you, john,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. i leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. if you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! if you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. i am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but i can't say what turn things are going to take. kindly sign the paper where mr. fordham shows you.'

"i signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. the singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and i pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. yet i could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. i could see a change in my uncle, however. he drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. when these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. at such times i have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.

"well, to come to an end of the matter, mr. holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. we found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. there was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' but i, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. the matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some $14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank."

"one moment," holmes interposed, "your statement is, i foresee, one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened. let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide."

"the letter arrived on march 10, 1883. his death was seven weeks later, upon the night of may 2nd."

"thank you. pray proceed."

"when my father took over the horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. we found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. on the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of k. k. k. repeated upon it, and 'letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath. these, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw. for the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in america. some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the north.

"well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the january of '85. on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. there he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. he had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.

" 'why, what on earth does this mean, john?' he stammered.

"my heart had turned to lead. 'it is k. k. k.,' said i.

"he looked inside the envelope. 'so it is,' he cried. 'here are the very letters. but what is this written above them?'

" 'put the papers on the sundial,' i read, peeping over his shoulder.

" 'what papers? what sundial?' he asked.

" 'the sundial in the garden. there is no other,' said i; 'but the papers must be those that are destroyed.'

" 'pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'we are in a civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind. where does the thing come from?'

" 'from dundee,' i answered, glancing at the postmark.

" 'some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'what have i to do with sundials and papers? i shall take no notice of such nonsense.'

" 'i should certainly speak to the police,' i said.

" 'and be laughed at for my pains. nothing of the sort.'

" 'then let me do so?'

" 'no, i forbid you. i won't have a fuss made about such nonsense.'

"it was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. i went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.

"on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, major freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill. i was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. in that, however, i was in error. upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. my father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. i hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. he had, as it appears, been returning from fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.' carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death, i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. there were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that i was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.

"in this sinister way i came into my inheritance. you will ask me why i did not dispose of it? i answer, because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.

"it was in january, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. during that time i have lived happily at horsham, and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. i had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father."

the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.

"this is the envelope," he continued. "the postmark is london--eastern division. within are the very words which were upon my father's last message: 'k. k. k.'; and then 'put the papers on the sundial.' "

"what have you done?" asked holmes.

"nothing."

"nothing?"

"to tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white hands--"i have felt helpless. i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against."

"tut! tut!" cried sherlock holmes. "you must act, man, or you are lost. nothing but energy can save you. this is no time for despair."

"i have seen the police."

"ah!"

"but they listened to my story with a smile. i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings."

holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "incredible imbecility!" he cried.

"they have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me."

"has he come with you to-night?"

"no. his orders were to stay in the house."

again holmes raved in the air.

"why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you not come at once?"

"i did not know. it was only to-day that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you."

"it is really two days since you had the letter. we should have acted before this. you have no further evidence, i suppose, than that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which might help us?"

"there is one thing," said john openshaw. he rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. "i have some remembrance," said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. beyond the mention of pips, i do not see that it helps us much. i think myself that it is a page from some private diary. the writing is undoubtedly my uncle's."

holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. it was headed, "march, 1869," and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:

"4th. hudson came. same old platform.

"7th. set the pips on mccauley, paramore, and

        john swain, of st. augustine.

"9th. mccauley cleared.

"10th. john swain cleared.

"12th. visited paramore. all well."

"thank you!" said holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. "and now you must on no account lose another instant. we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. you must get home instantly and act."

"what shall i do?"

"there is but one thing to do. it must be done at once. you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. do you understand?"

"entirely."

"do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. i think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties."

"i thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. "you have given me fresh life and hope. i shall certainly do as you advise."

"do not lose an instant. and, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. how do you go back?"

"by train from waterloo."

"it is not yet nine. the streets will be crowded, so i trust that you may be in safety. and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely."

"i am armed."

"that is well. to-morrow i shall set to work upon your case."

"i shall see you at horsham, then?"

"no, your secret lies in london. it is there that i shall seek it."

"then i shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. i shall take your advice in every particular." he shook hands with us and took his leave. outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. this strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.

sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.

"i think, watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this."

"save, perhaps, the sign of four."

"well, yes. save, perhaps, that. and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos."

"but have you," i asked, "formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?"

"there can be no question as to their nature," he answered.

"then what are they? who is this k. k. k., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?"

sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "the ideal reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. to carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. it is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this i have endeavoured in my case to do. if i remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion."

"yes," i answered, laughing. "it was a singular document. philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, i remember. botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. those, i think, were the main points of my analysis."

holmes grinned at the last item. "well," he said, "i say now, as i said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. kindly hand me down the letter k of the american encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you. thank you. now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. in the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america. men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town. his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america. as to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. did you remark the postmarks of those letters?"

"the first was from pondicherry, the second from dundee, and the third from london."

"from east london. what do you deduce from that?"

"they are all seaports. that the writer was on board of a ship."

"excellent. we have already a clue. there can be no doubt that the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was on board of a ship. and now let us consider another point. in the case of pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in dundee it was only some three or four days. does that suggest anything?"

"a greater distance to travel."

"but the letter had also a greater distance to come."

"then i do not see the point."

"there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee. if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. but, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer."

"it is possible."

"more than that. it is probable. and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why i urged young openshaw to caution. the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. but this one comes from london, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."

"good god!" i cried. "what can it mean, this relentless persecution?"

"the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner's jury. there must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. in this way you see k. k. k. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society."

"but of what society?"

"have you never--" said sherlock holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the ku klux klan?"

"i never have."

holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "here it is," said he presently:

" 'ku klux klan. a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. this terrible secret society was formed by some ex-confederate soldiers in the southern states after the civil war, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in tennessee, louisiana, the carolinas, georgia, and florida. its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. on receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. if he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. so perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. for some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south. eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'

"you will observe," said holmes, laying down the volume, "that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers. it may well have been cause and effect. it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."

"then the page we have seen--"

"is such as we might expect. it ran, if i remember right, 'sent the pips to a, b, and c'--that is, sent the society's warning to them. then there are successive entries that a and b cleared, or left the country, and finally that c was visited, with, i fear, a sinister result for c. well, i think, doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him. there is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men."

it had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down.

"you will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "i have, i foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaw's."

"what steps will you take?" i asked.

"it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. i may have to go down to horsham, after all."

"you will not go there first?"

"no, i shall commence with the city. just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee."

as i waited, i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.

"holmes," i cried, "you are too late."

"ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "i feared as much. how was it done?" he spoke calmly, but i could see that he was deeply moved.

"my eye caught the name of openshaw, and the heading 'tragedy near waterloo bridge.' here is the account:

" 'between nine and ten last night police-constable cook, of the h division, on duty near waterloo bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. the night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. the alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was john openshaw, and whose residence is near horsham. it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. the body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.' "

we sat in silence for some minutes, holmes more depressed and shaken than i had ever seen him.

"that hurts my pride, watson," he said at last. "it is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. it becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if god sends me health, i shall set my hand upon this gang. that he should come to me for help, and that i should send him away to his death--!" he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.

"they must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "how could they have decoyed him down there? the embankment is not on the direct line to the station. the bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. well, watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. i am going out now!"

"to the police?"

"no; i shall be my own police. when i have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before."

all day i was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street. sherlock holmes had not come back yet. it was nearly ten o'clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. he walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.

"you are hungry," i remarked.

"starving. it had escaped my memory. i have had nothing since breakfast."

"nothing?"

"not a bite. i had no time to think of it."

"and how have you succeeded?"

"well."

"you have a clue?"

"i have them in the hollow of my hand. young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. why, watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. it is well thought of!"

"what do you mean?"

he took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. on the inside of the flap he wrote "s. h. for j. o." then he sealed it and addressed it to "captain james calhoun, barque lone star, savannah, georgia."

"that will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling. "it may give him a sleepless night. he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him."

"and who is this captain calhoun?"

"the leader of the gang. i shall have the others, but he first."

"how did you trace it, then?"

he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.

"i have spent the whole day," said he, "over lloyd's registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in '83. there were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. of these, one, the lone star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from london, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union."

"texas, i think."

"i was not and am not sure which; but i knew that the ship must have an american origin."

"what then?"

"i searched the dundee records, and when i found that the barque lone star was there in january, '85, my suspicion became a certainty. i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london."

"yes?"

"the lone star had arrived here last week. i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to savannah. i wired to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight."

"what will you do, then?"

"oh, i have my hand upon him. he and the two mates, are as i learn, the only native-born americans in the ship. the others are finns and germans. i know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. by the time that their sailing-ship reaches savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder."

there is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. we waited long for news of the lone star of savannah, but none ever reached us. we did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters "l. s." carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the lone star.

adventure  vi.  the man with the twisted lip


isa whitney, brother of the late elias whitney, d.d., principal of the theological college of st. george's, was much addicted to opium. the habit grew upon him, as i understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read de quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. he found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. i can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.

one night--it was in june, '89--there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. i sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.

"a patient!" said she. "you'll have to go out."

i groaned, for i was newly come back from a weary day.

we heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.

"you will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "oh, i'm in such trouble!" she cried; "i do so want a little help."

"why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is kate whitney. how you startled me, kate! i had not an idea who you were when you came in."

"i didn't know what to do, so i came straight to you." that was always the way. folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.

"it was very sweet of you to come. now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. or should you rather that i sent james off to bed?"

"oh, no, no! i want the doctor's advice and help, too. it's about isa. he has not been home for two days. i am so frightened about him!"

it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. did she know where her husband was? was it possible that we could bring him back to her?

it seems that it was. she had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city. hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. but now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. there he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the bar of gold, in upper swandam lane. but what was she to do? how could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?

there was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. might i not escort her to this place? and then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? i was isa whitney's medical adviser, and as such i had influence over him. i could manage it better if i were alone. i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.

but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge. between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, i found the den of which i was in search. ordering my cab to wait, i passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door i found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.

through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. the most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.

as i entered, a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.

"thank you. i have not come to stay," said i. "there is a friend of mine here, mr. isa whitney, and i wish to speak with him."

there was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, i saw whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.

"my god! it's watson," said he. he was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "i say, watson, what o'clock is it?"

"nearly eleven."

"of what day?"

"of friday, june 19th."

"good heavens! i thought it was wednesday. it is wednesday. what d'you want to frighten a chap for?" he sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.

"i tell you that it is friday, man. your wife has been waiting this two days for you. you should be ashamed of yourself!"

"so i am. but you've got mixed, watson, for i have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--i forget how many. but i'll go home with you. i wouldn't frighten kate--poor little kate. give me your hand! have you a cab?"

"yes, i have one waiting."

"then i shall go in it. but i must owe something. find what i owe, watson. i am all off colour. i can do nothing for myself."

i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. as i passed the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, "walk past me, and then look back at me." the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. i glanced down. they could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. i took two steps forward and looked back. it took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. he had turned his back so that none could see him but i. his form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than sherlock holmes. he made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.

"holmes!" i whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"

"as low as you can," he answered; "i have excellent ears. if you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you."

"i have a cab outside."

"then pray send him home in it. you may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. i should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. if you will wait outside, i shall be with you in five minutes."

it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes' requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. i felt, however, that when whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, i could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. in a few minutes i had written my note, paid whitney's bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. in a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes. for two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.

"i suppose, watson," said he, "that you imagine that i have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views."

"i was certainly surprised to find you there."

"but not more so than i to find you."

"i came to find a friend."

"and i to find an enemy."

"an enemy?"

"yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall i say, my natural prey. briefly, watson, i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as i have done before now. had i been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour's purchase; for i have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. there is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of paul's wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights."

"what! you do not mean bodies?"

"ay, bodies, watson. we should be rich men if we had $1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. it is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and i fear that neville st. clair has entered it never to leave it more. but our trap should be here." he put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.

"now, watson," said holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. "you'll come with me, won't you?"

"if i can be of use."

"oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. my room at the cedars is a double-bedded one."

"the cedars?"

"yes; that is mr. st. clair's house. i am staying there while i conduct the inquiry."

"where is it, then?"

"near lee, in kent. we have a seven-mile drive before us."

"but i am all in the dark."

"of course you are. you'll know all about it presently. jump up here. all right, john; we shall not need you. here's half a crown. look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. give her her head. so long, then!"

he flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while i sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. we had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.

"you have a grand gift of silence, watson," said he. "it makes you quite invaluable as a companion. 'pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. i was wondering what i should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door."

"you forget that i know nothing about it."

"i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee. it seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow i can get nothing to go upon. there's plenty of thread, no doubt, but i can't get the end of it into my hand. now, i'll state the case clearly and concisely to you, watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me."

"proceed, then."

"some years ago--to be definite, in may, 1884--there came to lee a gentleman, neville st. clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. he took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. by degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. he had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from cannon street every night. mr. st. clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. i may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to $88 10s., while he has $220 standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank. there is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.

"last monday mr. neville st. clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company. now, if you are well up in your london, you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street, which branches out of upper swandam lane, where you found me to-night. mrs. st. clair had her lunch, started for the city, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station. have you followed me so far?"

"it is very clear."

"if you remember, monday was an exceedingly hot day, and mrs. st. clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. while she was walking in this way down swandam lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. the window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. he waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.

"convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night--and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. at the foot of the stairs, however, she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in fresno street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. the inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which mr. st. clair had last been seen. there was no sign of him there. in fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that mrs. st. clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. out there fell a cascade of children's bricks. it was the toy which he had promised to bring home.

"this discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. the rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. the front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr. neville st. clair, with the exception of his coat. his boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were there. there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of mr. neville st. clair. out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.

"and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by mrs. st. clair's story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. his defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman's clothes.

"so much for the lascar manager. now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st. clair. his name is hugh boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city. he is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. some little distance down threadneedle street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance, and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. his appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. a shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."

"but a cripple!" said i. "what could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?"

"he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. surely your medical experience would tell you, watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others."

"pray continue your narrative."

"mrs. st. clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. inspector barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. there were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. he denied strenuously having ever seen mr. neville st. clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. as to mrs. st. clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. he was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.

"and it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. it was neville st. clair's coat, and not neville st. clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. and what do you think they found in the pockets?"

"i cannot imagine."

"no, i don't think you would guess. every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. but a human body is a different matter. there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river."

"but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"

"no, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st. clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. what would he do then? it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. he would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. he has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. there is not an instant to be lost. he rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. he throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared."

"it certainly sounds feasible."

"well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. boone, as i have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. he had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. there the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved--what neville st. clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as ever. i confess that i cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."

while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.

"we are on the outskirts of lee," said my companion. "we have touched on three english counties in our short drive, starting in middlesex, passing over an angle of surrey, and ending in kent. see that light among the trees? that is the cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, i have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."

"but why are you not conducting the case from baker street?" i asked.

"because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. mrs. st. clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. i hate to meet her, watson, when i have no news of her husband. here we are. whoa, there, whoa!"

we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. a stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and springing down, i followed holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. as we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.

"well?" she cried, "well?" and then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.

"no good news?"

"none."

"no bad?"

"no."

"thank god for that. but come in. you must be weary, for you have had a long day."

"this is my friend, dr. watson. he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation."

"i am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly. "you will, i am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us."

"my dear madam," said i, "i am an old campaigner, and if i were not i can very well see that no apology is needed. if i can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, i shall be indeed happy."

"now, mr. sherlock holmes," said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, "i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which i beg that you will give a plain answer."

"certainly, madam."

"do not trouble about my feelings. i am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. i simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."

"upon what point?"

"in your heart of hearts, do you think that neville is alive?"

sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. "frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.

"frankly, then, madam, i do not."

"you think that he is dead?"

"i do."

"murdered?"

"i don't say that. perhaps."

"and on what day did he meet his death?"

"on monday."

"then perhaps, mr. holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him to-day."

sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.

"what!" he roared.

"yes, to-day." she stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.

"may i see it?"

"certainly."

he snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. i had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. the envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.

"coarse writing," murmured holmes. "surely this is not your husband's writing, madam."

"no, but the enclosure is."

"i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address."

"how can you tell that?"

"the name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. the rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. if it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. this man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. it is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. let us now see the letter. ha! there has been an enclosure here!"

"yes, there was a ring. his signet-ring."

"and you are sure that this is your husband's hand?"

"one of his hands."

"one?"

"his hand when he wrote hurriedly. it is very unlike his usual writing, and yet i know it well."

" 'dearest do not be frightened. all will come well. there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. wait in patience.--neville.' written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. hum! posted to-day in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. ha! and the flap has been gummed, if i am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. and you have no doubt that it is your husband's hand, madam?"

"none. neville wrote those words."

"and they were posted to-day at gravesend. well, mrs. st. clair, the clouds lighten, though i should not venture to say that the danger is over."

"but he must be alive, mr. holmes."

"unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. the ring, after all, proves nothing. it may have been taken from him."

"no, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"

"very well. it may, however, have been written on monday and only posted to-day."

"that is possible."

"if so, much may have happened between."

"oh, you must not discourage me, mr. holmes. i know that all is well with him. there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him. on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet i in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. do you think that i would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"

"i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. but if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?"

"i cannot imagine. it is unthinkable."

"and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you?"

"no."

"and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane?"

"very much so."

"was the window open?"

"yes."

"then he might have called to you?"

"he might."

"he only, as i understand, gave an inarticulate cry?"

"yes."

"a call for help, you thought?"

"yes. he waved his hands."

"but it might have been a cry of surprise. astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"

"it is possible."

"and you thought he was pulled back?"

"he disappeared so suddenly."

"he might have leaped back. you did not see anyone else in the room?"

"no, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs."

"quite so. your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?"

"but without his collar or tie. i distinctly saw his bare throat."

"had he ever spoken of swandam lane?"

"never."

"had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?"

"never."

"thank you, mrs. st. clair. those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear. we shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow."

a large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and i was quickly between the sheets, for i was weary after my night of adventure. sherlock holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. he took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. so he sat as i dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment. the pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night.

"awake, watson?" he asked.

"yes."

"game for a morning drive?"

"certainly."

"then dress. no one is stirring yet, but i know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." he chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.

as i dressed i glanced at my watch. it was no wonder that no one was stirring. it was twenty-five minutes past four. i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.

"i want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his boots. "i think, watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe. i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross. but i think i have the key of the affair now."

"and where is it?" i asked, smiling.

"in the bathroom," he answered. "oh, yes, i am not joking," he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "i have just been there, and i have taken it out, and i have got it in this gladstone bag. come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock."

we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. in the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. we both sprang in, and away we dashed down the london road. a few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.

"it has been in some points a singular case," said holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. "i confess that i have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all."

in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side. passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river, and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in bow street. sherlock holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. one of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.

"who is on duty?" asked holmes.

"inspector bradstreet, sir."

"ah, bradstreet, how are you?" a tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. "i wish to have a quiet word with you, bradstreet." "certainly, mr. holmes. step into my room here." it was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. the inspector sat down at his desk.

"what can i do for you, mr. holmes?"

"i called about that beggarman, boone--the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr. neville st. clair, of lee."

"yes. he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."

"so i heard. you have him here?"

"in the cells."

"is he quiet?"

"oh, he gives no trouble. but he is a dirty scoundrel."

"dirty?"

"yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker's. well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and i think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."

"i should like to see him very much."

"would you? that is easily done. come this way. you can leave your bag."

"no, i think that i'll take it."

"very good. come this way, if you please." he led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.

"the third on the right is his," said the inspector. "here it is!" he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.

"he is asleep," said he. "you can see him very well."

we both put our eyes to the grating. the prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. he was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. he was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. a broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.

"he's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.

"he certainly needs a wash," remarked holmes. "i had an idea that he might, and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me." he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.

"he! he! you are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.

"now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure."

"well, i don't know why not," said the inspector. "he doesn't look a credit to the bow street cells, does he?" he slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. the sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face.

"let me introduce you," he shouted, "to mr. neville st. clair, of lee, in the county of kent."

never in my life have i seen such a sight. the man's face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. gone was the coarse brown tint! gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! a twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.

"great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing man. i know him from the photograph."

the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. "be it so," said he. "and pray what am i charged with?"

"with making away with mr. neville st.-- oh, come, you can't be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it," said the inspector with a grin. "well, i have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."

"if i am mr. neville st. clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, i am illegally detained."

"no crime, but a very great error has been committed," said holmes. "you would have done better to have trusted you wife."

"it was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner. "god help me, i would not have them ashamed of their father. my god! what an exposure! what can i do?"

sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.

"if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said he, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. on the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, i do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. inspector bradstreet would, i am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. the case would then never go into court at all."

"god bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "i would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.

"you are the first who have ever heard my story. my father was a schoolmaster in chesterfield, where i received an excellent education. i travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london. one day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and i volunteered to supply them. there was the point from which all my adventures started. it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to base my articles. when an actor i had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. i took advantage now of my attainments. i painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, i took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. for seven hours i plied my trade, and when i returned home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than 26s. 4d.

"i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for $25. i was at my wit's end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. i begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise. in ten days i had the money and had paid the debt.

"well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at $2 a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. it was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and i threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. only one man knew my secret. he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane, where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. this fellow, a lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that i knew that my secret was safe in his possession.

"well, very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money. i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn $700 a year--which is less than my average takings--but i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city. all day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take $2.

"as i grew richer i grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. my dear wife knew that i had business in the city. she little knew what.

"last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. i gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. i heard her voice downstairs, but i knew that she could not ascend. swiftly i threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. but then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. i threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. then i seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which i carried my takings. i hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the thames. the other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after i found, rather, i confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as mr. neville st. clair, i was arrested as his murderer.

"i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear."

"that note only reached her yesterday," said holmes.

"good god! what a week she must have spent!"

"the police have watched this lascar," said inspector bradstreet, "and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."

"that was it," said holmes, nodding approvingly; "i have no doubt of it. but have you never been prosecuted for begging?"

"many times; but what was a fine to me?"

"it must stop here, however," said bradstreet. "if the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of hugh boone."

"i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."

"in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. but if you are found again, then all must come out. i am sure, mr. holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. i wish i knew how you reach your results."

"i reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. i think, watson, that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast."

vii.  the adventure of the blue carbuncle


i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second morning after christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.

"you are engaged," said i; "perhaps i interrupt you."

"not at all. i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results. the matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction."

i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. "i suppose," i remarked, "that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime."

"no, no. no crime," said sherlock holmes, laughing. "only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. we have already had experience of such."

"so much so," i remarked, "that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime."

"precisely. you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler papers, to the singular case of miss mary sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. well, i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. you know peterson, the commissionaire?"

"yes."

"it is to him that this trophy belongs."

"it is his hat."

"no, no, he found it. its owner is unknown. i beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. and, first, as to how it came here. it arrived upon christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, i have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of peterson's fire. the facts are these: about four o'clock on christmas morning, peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road. in front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. as he reached the corner of goodge street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. one of the latter knocked off the man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road. the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose."

"which surely he restored to their owner?"

"my dear fellow, there lies the problem. it is true that 'for mrs. henry baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'h. b.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of bakers, and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them."

"what, then, did peterson do?"

"he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. the goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner."

"did he not advertise?"

"no."

"then, what clue could you have as to his identity?"

"only as much as we can deduce."

"from his hat?"

"precisely."

"but you are joking. what can you gather from this old battered felt?"

"here is my lens. you know my methods. what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?"

i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. the lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. there was no maker's name; but, as holmes had remarked, the initials "h. b." were scrawled upon one side. it was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. for the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.

"i can see nothing," said i, handing it back to my friend.

"on the contrary, watson, you can see everything. you fail, however, to reason from what you see. you are too timid in drawing your inferences."

"then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"

he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. "it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. he had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him."

"my dear holmes!"

"he has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "he is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house."

"you are certainly joking, holmes."

"not in the least. is it possible that even now, when i give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"

"i have no doubt that i am very stupid, but i must confess that i am unable to follow you. for example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?"

for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head. it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "it is a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a brain must have something in it."

"the decline of his fortunes, then?"

"this hat is three years old. these flat brims curled at the edge came in then. it is a hat of the very best quality. look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."

"well, that is clear enough, certainly. but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?"

sherlock holmes laughed. "here is the foresight," said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. "they are never sold upon hats. if this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. on the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect."

"your reasoning is certainly plausible."

"the further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. the lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. they all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. this dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training."

"but his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."

"this hat has not been brushed for weeks. when i see you, my dear watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection."

"but he might be a bachelor."

"nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. remember the card upon the bird's leg."

"you have an answer to everything. but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?"

"one tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when i see no less than five, i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. are you satisfied?"

"well, it is very ingenious," said i, laughing; "but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy."

sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.

"the goose, mr. holmes! the goose, sir!" he gasped.

"eh? what of it, then? has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?" holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.

"see here, sir! see what my wife found in its crop!" he held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.

sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle. "by jove, peterson!" said he, "this is treasure trove indeed. i suppose you know what you have got?"

"a diamond, sir? a precious stone. it cuts into glass as though it were putty."

"it's more than a precious stone. it is the precious stone."

"not the countess of morcar's blue carbuncle!" i ejaculated.

"precisely so. i ought to know its size and shape, seeing that i have read the advertisement about it in the times every day lately. it is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price."

"a thousand pounds! great lord of mercy!" the commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.

"that is the reward, and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem."

"it was lost, if i remember aright, at the hotel cosmopolitan," i remarked.

"precisely so, on december 22nd, just five days ago. john horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's jewel-case. the evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes. i have some account of the matter here, i believe." he rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:

"hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery. john horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. james ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dressing-room of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. he had remained with horner some little time, but had finally been called away. on returning, he found that horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. ryder instantly gave the alarm, and horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. catherine cusack, maid to the countess, deposed to having heard ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. inspector bradstreet, b division, gave evidence as to the arrest of horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the assizes. horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court."

"hum! so much for the police-court," said holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. "the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other. you see, watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from mr. henry baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which i have bored you. so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. to do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. if this fail, i shall have recourse to other methods."

"what will you say?"

"give me a pencil and that slip of paper. now, then: 'found at the corner of goodge street, a goose and a black felt hat. mr. henry baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221b, baker street.' that is clear and concise."

"very. but will he see it?"

"well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. here you are, peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers."

"in which, sir?"

"oh, in the globe, star, pall mall, st. james's, evening news, standard, echo, and any others that occur to you."

"very well, sir. and this stone?"

"ah, yes, i shall keep the stone. thank you. and, i say, peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring."

when the commissionaire had gone, holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. "it's a bonny thing," said he. "just see how it glints and sparkles. of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. every good stone is. they are the devil's pet baits. in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. this stone is not yet twenty years old. it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. in spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. there have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? i'll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it."

"do you think that this man horner is innocent?"

"i cannot tell."

"well, then, do you imagine that this other one, henry baker, had anything to do with the matter?"

"it is, i think, much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. that, however, i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement."

"and you can do nothing until then?"

"nothing."

"in that case i shall continue my professional round. but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."

"very glad to see you. i dine at seven. there is a woodcock, i believe. by the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps i ought to ask mrs. hudson to examine its crop."

i had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when i found myself in baker street once more. as i approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. just as i arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to holmes' room.

"mr. henry baker, i believe," said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. "pray take this chair by the fire, mr. baker. it is a cold night, and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. ah, watson, you have just come at the right time. is that your hat, mr. baker?"

"yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."

he was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. a touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled holmes' surmise as to his habits. his rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. he spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.

"we have retained these things for some days," said holmes, "because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."

our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were," he remarked. "i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them."

"very naturally. by the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it."

"to eat it!" our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.

"yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?"

"oh, certainly, certainly," answered mr. baker with a sigh of relief.

"of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish--"

the man burst into a hearty laugh. "they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that i can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. no, sir, i think that, with your permission, i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard."

sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.

"there is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "by the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? i am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and i have seldom seen a better grown goose."

"certainly, sir," said baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. "there are a few of us who frequent the alpha inn, near the museum--we are to be found in the museum itself during the day, you understand. this year our good host, windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at christmas. my pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. i am much indebted to you, sir, for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.

"so much for mr. henry baker," said holmes when he had closed the door behind him. "it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. are you hungry, watson?"

"not particularly."

"then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot."

"by all means."

it was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter, wimpole street, harley street, and so through wigmore street into oxford street. in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at the alpha inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into holborn. holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.

"your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese," said he.

"my geese!" the man seemed surprised.

"yes. i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr. henry baker, who was a member of your goose club."

"ah! yes, i see. but you see, sir, them's not our geese."

"indeed! whose, then?"

"well, i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden."

"indeed? i know some of them. which was it?"

"breckinridge is his name."

"ah! i don't know him. well, here's your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. good-night."

"now for mr. breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. "remember, watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. it is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. let us follow it out to the bitter end. faces to the south, then, and quick march!"

we passed across holborn, down endell street, and so through a zigzag of slums to covent garden market. one of the largest stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.

"good-evening. it's a cold night," said holmes.

the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.

"sold out of geese, i see," continued holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.

"let you have five hundred to-morrow morning."

"that's no good."

"well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare."

"ah, but i was recommended to you."

"who by?"

"the landlord of the alpha."

"oh, yes; i sent him a couple of dozen."

"fine birds they were, too. now where did you get them from?"

to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.

"now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, "what are you driving at? let's have it straight, now."

"it is straight enough. i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the alpha."

"well then, i shan't tell you. so now!"

"oh, it is a matter of no importance; but i don't know why you should be so warm over such a trifle."

"warm! you'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as i am. when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it's 'where are the geese?' and 'who did you sell the geese to?' and 'what will you take for the geese?' one would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them."

"well, i have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries," said holmes carelessly. "if you won't tell us the bet is off, that is all. but i'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and i have a fiver on it that the bird i ate is country bred."

"well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped the salesman.

"it's nothing of the kind."

"i say it is."

"i don't believe it."

"d'you think you know more about fowls than i, who have handled them ever since i was a nipper? i tell you, all those birds that went to the alpha were town bred."

"you'll never persuade me to believe that."

"will you bet, then?"

"it's merely taking your money, for i know that i am right. but i'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate."

the salesman chuckled grimly. "bring me the books, bill," said he.

the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.

"now then, mr. cocksure," said the salesman, "i thought that i was out of geese, but before i finish you'll find that there is still one left in my shop. you see this little book?"

"well?"

"that's the list of the folk from whom i buy. d'you see? well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. now, then! you see this other page in red ink? well, that is a list of my town suppliers. now, look at that third name. just read it out to me."

"mrs. oakshott, 117, brixton road--249," read holmes.

"quite so. now turn that up in the ledger."

holmes turned to the page indicated. "here you are, 'mrs. oakshott, 117, brixton road, egg and poultry supplier.' "

"now, then, what's the last entry?"

" 'december 22nd. twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.' "

"quite so. there you are. and underneath?"

" 'sold to mr. windigate of the alpha, at 12s.' "

"what have you to say now?"

sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined. he drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. a few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.

"when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet," said he. "i daresay that if i had put $100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. well, watson, we are, i fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this mrs. oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. it is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and i should--"

his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.

"i've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "i wish you were all at the devil together. if you come pestering me any more with your silly talk i'll set the dog at you. you bring mrs. oakshott here and i'll answer her, but what have you to do with it? did i buy the geese off you?"

"no; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little man.

"well, then, ask mrs. oakshott for it."

"she told me to ask you."

"well, you can ask the king of proosia, for all i care. i've had enough of it. get out of this!" he rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.

"ha! this may save us a visit to brixton road," whispered holmes. "come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow." striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. he sprang round, and i could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.

"who are you, then? what do you want?" he asked in a quavering voice.

"you will excuse me," said holmes blandly, "but i could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. i think that i could be of assistance to you."

"you? who are you? how could you know anything of the matter?"

"my name is sherlock holmes. it is my business to know what other people don't know."

"but you can know nothing of this?"

"excuse me, i know everything of it. you are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by mrs. oakshott, of brixton road, to a salesman named breckinridge, by him in turn to mr. windigate, of the alpha, and by him to his club, of which mr. henry baker is a member."

"oh, sir, you are the very man whom i have longed to meet," cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. "i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter."

sherlock holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "in that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place," said he. "but pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting."

the man hesitated for an instant. "my name is john robinson," he answered with a sidelong glance.

"no, no; the real name," said holmes sweetly. "it is always awkward doing business with an alias."

a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "well then," said he, "my real name is james ryder."

"precisely so. head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan. pray step into the cab, and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know."

the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at baker street. nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.

"here we are!" said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. "the fire looks very seasonable in this weather. you look cold, mr. ryder. pray take the basket-chair. i will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. now, then! you want to know what became of those geese?"

"yes, sir."

"or rather, i fancy, of that goose. it was one bird, i imagine in which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the tail."

ryder quivered with emotion. "oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell me where it went to?"

"it came here."

"here?"

"yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. i don't wonder that you should take an interest in it. it laid an egg after it was dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. i have it here in my museum."

our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.

"the game's up, ryder," said holmes quietly. "hold up, man, or you'll be into the fire! give him an arm back into his chair, watson. he's not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. give him a dash of brandy. so! now he looks a little more human. what a shrimp it is, to be sure!"

for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.

"i have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which i could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. you had heard, ryder, of this blue stone of the countess of morcar's?"

"it was catherine cusack who told me of it," said he in a crackling voice.

"i see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. it seems to me, ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. you knew that this man horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. what did you do, then? you made some small job in my lady's room--you and your confederate cusack--and you managed that he should be the man sent for. then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. you then--"

ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees. "for god's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked. "think of my father! of my mother! it would break their hearts. i never went wrong before! i never will again. i swear it. i'll swear it on a bible. oh, don't bring it into court! for christ's sake, don't!"

"get back into your chair!" said holmes sternly. "it is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."

"i will fly, mr. holmes. i will leave the country, sir. then the charge against him will break down."

"hum! we will talk about that. and now let us hear a true account of the next act. how came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety."

ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "i will tell you it just as it happened, sir," said he. "when horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for i did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. i went out, as if on some commission, and i made for my sister's house. she had married a man named oakshott, and lived in brixton road, where she fattened fowls for the market. all the way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before i came to the brixton road. my sister asked me what was the matter, and why i was so pale; but i told her that i had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. then i went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.

"i had a friend once called maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in pentonville. one day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. i knew that he would be true to me, for i knew one or two things about him; so i made up my mind to go right on to kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. he would show me how to turn the stone into money. but how to get to him in safety? i thought of the agonies i had gone through in coming from the hotel. i might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. i was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the best detective that ever lived.

"my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present, and i knew that she was always as good as her word. i would take my goose now, and in it i would carry my stone to kilburn. there was a little shed in the yard, and behind this i drove one of the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. i caught it, and prying its bill open, i thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. the bird gave a gulp, and i felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. but the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.

" 'whatever were you doing with that bird, jem?' says she.

" 'well,' said i, 'you said you'd give me one for christmas, and i was feeling which was the fattest.'

" 'oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--jem's bird, we call it. it's the big white one over yonder. there's twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.'

" 'thank you, maggie,' says i; 'but if it is all the same to you, i'd rather have that one i was handling just now.'

" 'the other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we fattened it expressly for you.'

" 'never mind. i'll have the other, and i'll take it now,' said i.

" 'oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'which is it you want, then?'

" 'that white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.'

" 'oh, very well. kill it and take it with you.'

"well, i did what she said, mr. holmes, and i carried the bird all the way to kilburn. i told my pal what i had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. he laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. my heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. i left the bird, rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. there was not a bird to be seen there.

" 'where are they all, maggie?' i cried.

" 'gone to the dealer's, jem.'

" 'which dealer's?'

" 'breckinridge, of covent garden.'

" 'but was there another with a barred tail?' i asked, 'the same as the one i chose?'

" 'yes, jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and i could never tell them apart.'

"well, then, of course i saw it all, and i ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. you heard him yourselves to-night. well, he has always answered me like that. my sister thinks that i am going mad. sometimes i think that i am myself. and now--and now i am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character. god help me! god help me!" he burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.

there was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the table. then my friend rose and threw open the door.

"get out!" said he.

"what, sir! oh, heaven bless you!"

"no more words. get out!"

and no more words were needed. there was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.

"after all, watson," said holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, "i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. if horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. i suppose that i am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that i am saving a soul. this fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. besides, it is the season of forgiveness. chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. if you will have the goodness to touch the bell, doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature."

viii.  the adventure of the speckled band


on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock holmes, i find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. of all these varied cases, however, i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran. the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street. it is possible that i might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which i have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. it is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for i have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of dr. grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.

it was early in april in the year '83 that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. he was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, i blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for i was myself regular in my habits.

"very sorry to knock you up, watson," said he, "but it's the common lot this morning. mrs. hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and i on you."

"what is it, then--a fire?"

"no; a client. it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. she is waiting now in the sitting-room. now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, i am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. i thought, at any rate, that i should call you and give you the chance."

"my dear fellow, i would not miss it for anything."

i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. i rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.

"good-morning, madam," said holmes cheerily. "my name is sherlock holmes. this is my intimate friend and associate, dr. watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. ha! i am glad to see that mrs. hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. pray draw up to it, and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for i observe that you are shivering."

"it is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.

"what, then?"

"it is fear, mr. holmes. it is terror." she raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.

"you must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. "we shall soon set matters right, i have no doubt. you have come in by train this morning, i see."

"you know me, then?"

"no, but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. you must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station."

the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.

"there is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. the marks are perfectly fresh. there is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."

"whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said she. "i started from home before six, reached leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to waterloo. sir, i can stand this strain no longer; i shall go mad if it continues. i have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. i have heard of you, mr. holmes; i have heard of you from mrs. farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. it was from her that i had your address. oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks i shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."

holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.

"farintosh," said he. "ah yes, i recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. i think it was before your time, watson. i can only say, madam, that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend. as to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to, at the time which suits you best. and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter."

"alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. he does not say so, but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. but i have heard, mr. holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me."

"i am all attention, madam."

"my name is helen stoner, and i am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england, the roylotts of stoke moran, on the western border of surrey."

holmes nodded his head. "the name is familiar to me," said he.

"the family was at one time among the richest in england, and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north, and hampshire in the west. in the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency. nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. the last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. in a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. as it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man.

"when dr. roylott was in india he married my mother, mrs. stoner, the young widow of major-general stoner, of the bengal artillery. my sister julia and i were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage. she had a considerable sum of money--not less than $1000 a year--and this she bequeathed to dr. roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. shortly after our return to england my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe. dr. roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran. the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.

"but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case it had, i believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. a series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.

"last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure. he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. he has a passion also for indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.

"you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives. no servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. she was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."

"your sister is dead, then?"

"she died just two years ago, and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you. you can understand that, living the life which i have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. we had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, miss honoria westphail, who lives near harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house. julia went there at christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."

sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.

"pray be precise as to details," said he.

"it is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. the manor-house is, as i have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. of these bedrooms the first is dr. roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my own. there is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. do i make myself plain?"

"perfectly so."

"the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. that fatal night dr. roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. she left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. at eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.

" 'tell me, helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?'

" 'never,' said i.

" 'i suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?'

" 'certainly not. but why?'

" 'because during the last few nights i have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. i am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. i cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. i thought that i would just ask you whether you had heard it.'

" 'no, i have not. it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.'

" 'very likely. and yet if it were on the lawn, i wonder that you did not hear it also.'

" 'ah, but i sleep more heavily than you.'

" 'well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' she smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock."

"indeed," said holmes. "was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?"

"always."

"and why?"

"i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked."

"quite so. pray proceed with your statement."

"i could not sleep that night. a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. my sister and i, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. it was a wild night. the wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. i knew that it was my sister's voice. i sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. as i ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. i stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. by the light of the corridor-lamp i saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. i ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. she writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. at first i thought that she had not recognised me, but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget, 'oh, my god! helen! it was the band! the speckled band!' there was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. i rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. when he reached my sister's side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."

"one moment," said holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? could you swear to it?"

"that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. it is my strong impression that i heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, i may possibly have been deceived."

"was your sister dressed?"

"no, she was in her night-dress. in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."

"showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. that is important. and what conclusions did the coroner come to?"

"he investigated the case with great care, for dr. roylott's conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. the walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. the chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. it is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."

"how about poison?"

"the doctors examined her for it, but without success."

"what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"

"it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine."

"were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"

"yes, there are nearly always some there."

"ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?"

"sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used."

holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.

"these are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your narrative."

"two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. a month ago, however, a dear friend, whom i have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. his name is armitage--percy armitage--the second son of mr. armitage, of crane water, near reading. my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as i lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. i sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. i was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so i dressed, and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down, got a dog-cart at the crown inn, which is opposite, and drove to leatherhead, from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice."

"you have done wisely," said my friend. "but have you told me all?"

"yes, all."

"miss roylott, you have not. you are screening your stepfather."

"why, what do you mean?"

for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.

"you have been cruelly used," said holmes.

the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "he is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."

there was a long silence, during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.

"this is a very deep business," he said at last. "there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action. yet we have not a moment to lose. if we were to come to stoke moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?"

"as it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. it is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. we have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and i could easily get her out of the way."

"excellent. you are not averse to this trip, watson?"

"by no means."

"then we shall both come. what are you going to do yourself?"

"i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town. but i shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming."

"and you may expect us early in the afternoon. i have myself some small business matters to attend to. will you not wait and breakfast?"

"no, i must go. my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you. i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon." she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.

"and what do you think of it all, watson?" asked sherlock holmes, leaning back in his chair.

"it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."

"dark enough and sinister enough."

"yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end."

"what becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?"

"i cannot think."

"when you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."

"but what, then, did the gipsies do?"

"i cannot imagine."

"i see many objections to any such theory."

"and so do i. it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day. i want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. but what in the name of the devil!"

the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. a large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.

"which of you is holmes?" asked this apparition.

"my name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my companion quietly.

"i am dr. grimesby roylott, of stoke moran."

"indeed, doctor," said holmes blandly. "pray take a seat."

"i will do nothing of the kind. my stepdaughter has been here. i have traced her. what has she been saying to you?"

"it is a little cold for the time of the year," said holmes.

"what has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man furiously.

"but i have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my companion imperturbably.

"ha! you put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "i know you, you scoundrel! i have heard of you before. you are holmes, the meddler."

my friend smiled.

"holmes, the busybody!"

his smile broadened.

"holmes, the scotland yard jack-in-office!"

holmes chuckled heartily. "your conversation is most entertaining," said he. "when you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught."

"i will go when i have said my say. don't you dare to meddle with my affairs. i know that miss stoner has been here. i traced her! i am a dangerous man to fall foul of! see here." he stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.

"see that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.

"he seems a very amiable person," said holmes, laughing. "i am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." as he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.

"fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! this incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. and now, watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors' commons, where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter."

it was nearly one o'clock when sherlock holmes returned from his excursion. he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.

"i have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. the total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little short of $1100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than $750. each daughter can claim an income of $250, in case of marriage. it is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. my morning's work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. and now, watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo. i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. an eley's no. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. that and a tooth-brush are, i think, all that we need."

at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes. it was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. my companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.

"look there!" said he.

a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.

"stoke moran?" said he.

"yes, sir, that be the house of dr. grimesby roylott," remarked the driver.

"there is some building going on there," said holmes; "that is where we are going."

"there's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. there it is, where the lady is walking."

"and the lady, i fancy, is miss stoner," observed holmes, shading his eyes. "yes, i think we had better do as you suggest."

we got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead.

"i thought it as well," said holmes as we climbed the stile, "that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. it may stop his gossip. good-afternoon, miss stoner. you see that we have been as good as our word."

our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. "i have been waiting so eagerly for you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "all has turned out splendidly. dr. roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."

"we have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance," said holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.

"good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."

"so it appears."

"he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him. what will he say when he returns?"

"he must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. you must lock yourself up from him to-night. if he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt's at harrow. now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine."

the building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. the central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.

"this, i take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main building to dr. roylott's chamber?"

"exactly so. but i am now sleeping in the middle one."

"pending the alterations, as i understand. by the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall."

"there were none. i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."

"ah! that is suggestive. now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. there are windows in it, of course?"

"yes, but very small ones. too narrow for anyone to pass through."

"as you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?"

miss stoner did so, and holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. "hum!" said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some difficulties. no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."

a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which miss stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. it was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. these articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre. the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.

"where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.

"it goes to the housekeeper's room."

"it looks newer than the other things?"

"yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."

"your sister asked for it, i suppose?"

"no, i never heard of her using it. we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."

"indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor." he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.

"why, it's a dummy," said he.

"won't it ring?"

"no, it is not even attached to a wire. this is very interesting. you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is."

"how very absurd! i never noticed that before."

"very strange!" muttered holmes, pulling at the rope. "there are one or two very singular points about this room. for example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!"

"that is also quite modern," said the lady.

"done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked holmes.

"yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."

"they seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. with your permission, miss stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment."

dr. grimesby roylott's chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. a camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.

"what's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.

"my stepfather's business papers."

"oh! you have seen inside, then?"

"only once, some years ago. i remember that it was full of papers."

"there isn't a cat in it, for example?"

"no. what a strange idea!"

"well, look at this!" he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.

"no; we don't keep a cat. but there is a cheetah and a baboon."

"ah, yes, of course! well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, i daresay. there is one point which i should wish to determine." he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.

"thank you. that is quite settled," said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. "hullo! here is something interesting!"

the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. the lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.

"what do you make of that, watson?"

"it's a common enough lash. but i don't know why it should be tied."

"that is not quite so common, is it? ah, me! it's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. i think that i have seen enough now, miss stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."

i had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. we had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.

"it is very essential, miss stoner," said he, "that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect."

"i shall most certainly do so."

"the matter is too serious for any hesitation. your life may depend upon your compliance."

"i assure you that i am in your hands."

"in the first place, both my friend and i must spend the night in your room."

both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment.

"yes, it must be so. let me explain. i believe that that is the village inn over there?"

"yes, that is the crown."

"very good. your windows would be visible from there?"

"certainly."

"you must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. i have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."

"oh, yes, easily."

"the rest you will leave in our hands."

"but what will you do?"

"we shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."

"i believe, mr. holmes, that you have already made up your mind," said miss stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.

"perhaps i have."

"then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's death."

"i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak."

"you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright."

"no, i do not think so. i think that there was probably some more tangible cause. and now, miss stoner, we must leave you for if dr. roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what i have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you."

sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the crown inn. they were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house. at dusk we saw dr. grimesby roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. the trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.

"do you know, watson," said holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, "i have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. there is a distinct element of danger."

"can i be of assistance?"

"your presence might be invaluable."

"then i shall certainly come."

"it is very kind of you."

"you speak of danger. you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me."

"no, but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more. i imagine that you saw all that i did."

"i saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine."

"you saw the ventilator, too?"

"yes, but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through."

"i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran."

"my dear holmes!"

"oh, yes, i did. you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr. roylott's cigar. now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. it could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. i deduced a ventilator."

"but what harm can there be in that?"

"well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. a ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. does not that strike you?"

"i cannot as yet see any connection."

"did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"

"no."

"it was clamped to the floor. did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?"

"i cannot say that i have."

"the lady could not move her bed. it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."

"holmes," i cried, "i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime."

"subtle enough and horrible enough. when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. he has nerve and he has knowledge. palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession. this man strikes even deeper, but i think, watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."

about nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the manor house. two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.

"that is our signal," said holmes, springing to his feet; "it comes from the middle window."

as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. a moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.

there was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.

"my god!" i whispered; "did you see it?"

holmes was for the moment as startled as i. his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.

"it is a nice household," he murmured. "that is the baboon."

i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. there was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. i confess that i felt easier in my mind when, after following holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, i found myself inside the bedroom. my companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. all was as we had seen it in the daytime. then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words:

"the least sound would be fatal to our plans."

i nodded to show that i had heard.

"we must sit without light. he would see it through the ventilator."

i nodded again.

"do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. have your pistol ready in case we should need it. i will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair."

i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.

holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.

how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil? i could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet i knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself. the shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.

from outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. how long they seemed, those quarters! twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.

suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. i heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. for half an hour i sat with straining ears. then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. the instant that we heard it, holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.

"you see it, watson?" he yelled. "you see it?"

but i saw nothing. at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. i could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened. it swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. they say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. it struck cold to our hearts, and i stood gazing at holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.

"what can it mean?" i gasped.

"it means that it is all over," holmes answered. "and perhaps, after all, it is for the best. take your pistol, and we will enter dr. roylott's room."

with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. then he turned the handle and entered, i at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.

it was a singular sight which met our eyes. on the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat dr. grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers. across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. as we entered he made neither sound nor motion.

"the band! the speckled band!" whispered holmes.

i took a step forward. in an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.

"it is a swamp adder!" cried holmes; "the deadliest snake in india. he has died within ten seconds of being bitten. violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened."

as he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.

such are the true facts of the death of dr. grimesby roylott, of stoke moran. it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day.

"i had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. the presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. my attention was speedily drawn, as i have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. the discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india, i felt that i was probably on the right track. the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training. the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. it would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. then i thought of the whistle. of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. he had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. it might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.

"i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room. an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. the sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. having once made up my mind, you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof. i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also, and i instantly lit the light and attacked it."

"with the result of driving it through the ventilator."

"and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr. grimesby roylott's death, and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."

ix.  the adventure of the engineer's thumb


of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, mr. sherlock holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his notice--that of mr. hatherley's thumb, and that of colonel warburton's madness. of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. the story has, i believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.

it was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which i am now about to summarise. i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms, although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. my practice had steadily increased, and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station, i got a few patients from among the officials. one of these, whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.

one morning, at a little before seven o'clock, i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. i dressed hurriedly, for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. as i descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.

"i've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; "he's all right."

"what is it, then?" i asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.

"it's a new patient," he whispered. "i thought i'd bring him round myself; then he couldn't slip away. there he is, all safe and sound. i must go now, doctor; i have my dooties, just the same as you." and off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.

i entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. he was young, not more than five-and-twenty, i should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.

"i am sorry to knock you up so early, doctor," said he, "but i have had a very serious accident during the night. i came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. i gave the maid a card, but i see that she has left it upon the side-table."

i took it up and glanced at it. "mr. victor hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16a, victoria street (3rd floor)." that was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. "i regret that i have kept you waiting," said i, sitting down in my library-chair. "you are fresh from a night journey, i understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation."

"oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and laughed. he laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.

"stop it!" i cried; "pull yourself together!" and i poured out some water from a caraffe.

it was useless, however. he was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.

"i have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.

"not at all. drink this." i dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.

"that's better!" said he. "and now, doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be."

he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.

"good heavens!" i cried, "this is a terrible injury. it must have bled considerably."

"yes, it did. i fainted when it was done, and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time. when i came to i found that it was still bleeding, so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."

"excellent! you should have been a surgeon."

"it is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province."

"this has been done," said i, examining the wound, "by a very heavy and sharp instrument."

"a thing like a cleaver," said he.

"an accident, i presume?"

"by no means."

"what! a murderous attack?"

"very murderous indeed."

"you horrify me."

i sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. he lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.

"how is that?" i asked when i had finished.

"capital! between your brandy and your bandage, i feel a new man. i was very weak, but i have had a good deal to go through."

"perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. it is evidently trying to your nerves."

"oh, no, not now. i shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, i should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done."

"ha!" cried i, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, mr. sherlock holmes, before you go to the official police."

"oh, i have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and i should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course i must use the official police as well. would you give me an introduction to him?"

"i'll do better. i'll take you round to him myself."

"i should be immensely obliged to you."

"we'll call a cab and go together. we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. do you feel equal to it?"

"yes; i shall not feel easy until i have told my story."

"then my servant will call a cab, and i shall be with you in an instant." i rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to baker street.

sherlock holmes was, as i expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of the times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. he received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.

"it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, mr. hatherley," said he. "pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."

"thank you," said my patient. "but i have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and i think that your breakfast has completed the cure. i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences."

holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while i sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.

"you must know," said he, "that i am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in london. by profession i am a hydraulic engineer, and i have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that i was apprenticed to venner & matheson, the well-known firm, of greenwich. two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's death, i determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria street.

"i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. to me it has been exceptionally so. during two years i have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. my gross takings amount to $27 10s. every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, i waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at all.

"yesterday, however, just as i was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. he brought up a card, too, with the name of 'colonel lysander stark' engraved upon it. close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man. his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. he was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, i should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.

" 'mr. hatherley?' said he, with something of a german accent. 'you have been recommended to me, mr. hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.'

"i bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. 'may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'

" 'well, perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at this moment. i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london.'

" 'that is quite correct,' i answered; 'but you will excuse me if i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. i understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?'

" 'undoubtedly so. but you will find that all i say is really to the point. i have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'

" 'if i promise to keep a secret,' said i, 'you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.'

"he looked very hard at me as i spoke, and it seemed to me that i had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.

" 'do you promise, then?' said he at last.

" 'yes, i promise.'

" 'absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? no reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?'

" 'i have already given you my word.'

" 'very good.' he suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. the passage outside was empty.

" 'that's all right,' said he, coming back. 'i know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master's affairs. now we can talk in safety.' he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.

"a feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.

" 'i beg that you will state your business, sir,' said i; 'my time is of value.' heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.

" 'how would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.

" 'most admirably.'

" 'i say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. what do you think of such a commission as that?'

" 'the work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'

" 'precisely so. we shall want you to come to-night by the last train.'

" 'where to?'

" 'to eyford, in berkshire. it is a little place near the borders of oxfordshire, and within seven miles of reading. there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.'

" 'very good.'

" 'i shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'

" 'there is a drive, then?'

" 'yes, our little place is quite out in the country. it is a good seven miles from eyford station.'

" 'then we can hardly get there before midnight. i suppose there would be no chance of a train back. i should be compelled to stop the night.'

" 'yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'

" 'that is very awkward. could i not come at some more convenient hour?'

" 'we have judged it best that you should come late. it is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.'

"i thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. 'not at all,' said i, 'i shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. i should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.'

" 'quite so. it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?'

" 'entirely.'

" 'then the matter stands thus. you are probably aware that fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in england?'

" 'i have heard so.'

" 'some little time ago i bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of reading. i was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my fields. on examining it, however, i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this. i took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. this we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. this press, as i have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. we guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. that is why i have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to eyford to-night. i hope that i make it all plain?'

" 'i quite follow you,' said i. 'the only point which i could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as i understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.'

" 'ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. we compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. but that is a mere detail. i have taken you fully into my confidence now, mr. hatherley, and i have shown you how i trust you.' he rose as he spoke. 'i shall expect you, then, at eyford at 11:15.'

" 'i shall certainly be there.'

" 'and not a word to a soul.' he looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.

"well, when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. on the one hand, of course, i was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked had i set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. on the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and i could not think that his explanation of the fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell anyone of my errand. however, i threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.

"at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station. however, i was in time for the last train to eyford, and i reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. i was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. as i passed out through the wicket gate, however, i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. he drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go."

"one horse?" interjected holmes.

"yes, only one."

"did you observe the colour?"

"yes, i saw it by the side-lights when i was stepping into the carriage. it was a chestnut."

"tired-looking or fresh?"

"oh, fresh and glossy."

"thank you. i am sorry to have interrupted you. pray continue your most interesting statement."

"away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. colonel lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles, but i should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. he sat at my side in silence all the time, and i was aware, more than once when i glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. i tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and i could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. at last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. colonel lysander stark sprang out, and, as i followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. we stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that i failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.

"it was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. it grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. i could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich material. she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. colonel stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.

" 'perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. it was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several german books were scattered. colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. 'i shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and vanished into the darkness.

"i glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of german i could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. then i walked across to the window, hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. it was a wonderfully silent house. there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. who were these german people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? and where was the place? i was ten miles or so from eyford, that was all i knew, but whether north, south, east, or west i had no idea. for that matter, reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. i paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.

"suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. the woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.

" 'i would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; 'i would go. i should not stay here. there is no good for you to do.'

" 'but, madam,' said i, 'i have not yet done what i came for. i cannot possibly leave until i have seen the machine.'

" 'it is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'you can pass through the door; no one hinders.' and then, seeing that i smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'for the love of heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too late!'

"but i am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. i thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. was it all to go for nothing? why should i slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? this woman might, for all i knew, be a monomaniac. with a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess, i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was. she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. she listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.

"the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as mr. ferguson.

" 'this is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'by the way, i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now. i fear that you have felt the draught.'

" 'on the contrary,' said i, 'i opened the door myself because i felt the room to be a little close.'

"he shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'mr. ferguson and i will take you up to see the machine.'

" 'i had better put my hat on, i suppose.'

" 'oh, no, it is in the house.'

" 'what, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'

" 'no, no. this is only where we compress it. but never mind that. all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.'

"we went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and i behind him. it was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. i tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but i had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though i disregarded them, and i kept a keen eye upon my two companions. ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.

"colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.

" 'we are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. the machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.'

"i took the lamp from him, and i examined the machine very thoroughly. it was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. when i passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, i knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. an examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. this was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and i pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. when i had made it clear to them, i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. the walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.

" 'what are you doing there?' he asked.

"i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. 'i was admiring your fuller's-earth,' said i; 'i think that i should be better able to advise you as to your machine if i knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.'

"the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of my speech. his face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.

" 'very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' he took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. 'hullo!' i yelled. 'hullo! colonel! let me out!'

"and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. he had set the engine at work. the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough. by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. i threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. i implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised i could feel its hard, rough surface. then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it. if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? already i was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.

"i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. as i gave a last hurried glance around, i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. for an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. the next instant i threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. the panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.

"i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. it was the same good friend whose warning i had so foolishly rejected.

" 'come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'they will be here in a moment. they will see that you are not there. oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!'

"this time, at least, i did not scorn her advice. i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. the latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit's end. then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.

" 'it is your only chance,' said she. 'it is high, but it may be that you can jump it.'

"as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher's cleaver in the other. i rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. i clambered out upon the sill, but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. if she were ill-used, then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance. the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.

" 'fritz! fritz!' she cried in english, 'remember your promise after the last time. you said it should not be again. he will be silent! oh, he will be silent!'

" 'you are mad, elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from her. 'you will be the ruin of us. he has seen too much. let me pass, i say!' he dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. i had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. i was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and i fell into the garden below.

"i was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so i picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run, for i understood that i was far from being out of danger yet. suddenly, however, as i ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. i glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.

"how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell. it must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself. my clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure, and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. but to my astonishment, when i came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. i had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night. were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.

"half dazed, i went into the station and asked about the morning train. there would be one to reading in less than an hour. the same porter was on duty, i found, as had been there when i arrived. i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark. the name was strange to him. had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? no, he had not. was there a police-station anywhere near? there was one about three miles off.

"it was too far for me to go, weak and ill as i was. i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police. it was a little past six when i arrived, so i went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise."

we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.

"here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "it appeared in all the papers about a year ago. listen to this: 'lost, on the 9th inst., mr. jeremiah hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. was dressed in,' etc., etc. ha! that represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, i fancy."

"good heavens!" cried my patient. "then that explains what the girl said."

"undoubtedly. it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford."

some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from reading to the little berkshire village. there were sherlock holmes, the hydraulic engineer, inspector bradstreet, of scotland yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre.

"there you are," said he. "that circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. the place we want must be somewhere near that line. you said ten miles, i think, sir."

"it was an hour's good drive."

"and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?"

"they must have done so. i have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere."

"what i cannot understand," said i, "is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."

"i hardly think that likely. i never saw a more inexorable face in my life."

"oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said bradstreet. "well, i have drawn my circle, and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."

"i think i could lay my finger on it," said holmes quietly.

"really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your opinion! come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. i say it is south, for the country is more deserted there."

"and i say east," said my patient.

"i am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "there are several quiet little villages up there."

"and i am for north," said i, "because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any."

"come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty diversity of opinion. we have boxed the compass among us. who do you give your casting vote to?"

"you are all wrong."

"but we can't all be."

"oh, yes, you can. this is my point." he placed his finger in the centre of the circle. "this is where we shall find them."

"but the twelve-mile drive?" gasped hatherley.

"six out and six back. nothing simpler. you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"

"indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed bradstreet thoughtfully. "of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang."

"none at all," said holmes. "they are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver."

"we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work," said the inspector. "they have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. we even traced them as far as reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. but now, thanks to this lucky chance, i think that we have got them right enough."

but the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. as we rolled into eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.

"a house on fire?" asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.

"yes, sir!" said the station-master.

"when did it break out?"

"i hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze."

"whose house is it?"

"dr. becher's."

"tell me," broke in the engineer, "is dr. becher a german, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?"

the station-master laughed heartily. "no, sir, dr. becher is an englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. but he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as i understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm."

the station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. the road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.

"that's it!" cried hatherley, in intense excitement. "there is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where i lay. that second window is the one that i jumped from."

"well, at least," said holmes, "you have had your revenge upon them. there can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now."

and holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister german, or the morose englishman. early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even holmes' ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.

the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. about sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.

how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. he had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. on the whole, it was most probable that the silent englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.

"well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to london, "it has been a pretty business for me! i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have i gained?"

"experience," said holmes, laughing. "indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence."

x.  the adventure of the noble bachelor


the lord st. simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. as i have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, i feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.

it was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when i was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. i had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. with my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, i had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, i tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's noble correspondent could be.

"here is a very fashionable epistle," i remarked as he entered. "your morning letters, if i remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter."

"yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the more interesting. this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."

he broke the seal and glanced over the contents.

"oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all."

"not social, then?"

"no, distinctly professional."

"and from a noble client?"

"one of the highest in england."

"my dear fellow, i congratulate you."

"i assure you, watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. it is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. you have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?"

"it looks like it," said i ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. "i have had nothing else to do."

"it is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. the latter is always instructive. but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st. simon and his wedding?"

"oh, yes, with the deepest interest."

"that is well. the letter which i hold in my hand is from lord st. simon. i will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. this is what he says:

" 'my dear mr. sherlock holmes:--lord backwater tells me that i may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. i have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. mr. lestrade, of scotland yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. i will call at four o'clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, i hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. yours faithfully,


" 'st. simon.'

"it is dated from grosvenor mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked holmes as he folded up the epistle.

"he says four o'clock. it is three now. he will be here in an hour."

"then i have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while i take a glance as to who our client is." he picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. "here he is," said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. " 'lord robert walsingham de vere st. simon, second son of the duke of balmoral.' hum! 'arms: azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. born in 1846.' he's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. was under-secretary for the colonies in a late administration. the duke, his father, was at one time secretary for foreign affairs. they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent, and tudor on the distaff side. ha! well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. i think that i must turn to you watson, for something more solid."

"i have very little difficulty in finding what i want," said i, "for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. i feared to refer them to you, however, as i knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters."

"oh, you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van. that is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. pray give me the results of your newspaper selections."

"here is the first notice which i can find. it is in the personal column of the morning post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: 'a marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between lord robert st. simon, second son of the duke of balmoral, and miss hatty doran, the only daughter of aloysius doran. esq., of san francisco, cal., u.s.a.' that is all."

"terse and to the point," remarked holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.

"there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. ah, here it is: 'there will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic. an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. lord st. simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty doran, the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire. miss doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as lord st. simon has no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor, it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a british peeress.' "

"anything else?" asked holmes, yawning.

"oh, yes; plenty. then there is another note in the morning post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at st. george's, hanover square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr. aloysius doran. two days later--that is, on wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord backwater's place, near petersfield. those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."

"before the what?" asked holmes with a start.

"the vanishing of the lady."

"when did she vanish, then?"

"at the wedding breakfast."

"indeed. this is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact."

"yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."

"they often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. pray let me have the details."

"i warn you that they are very incomplete."

"perhaps we may make them less so."

"such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which i will read to you. it is headed, 'singular occurrence at a fashionable wedding':

" 'the family of lord robert st. simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. the ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. in spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.

" 'the ceremony, which was performed at st. george's, hanover square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, mr. aloysius doran, the duchess of balmoral, lord backwater, lord eustace and lady clara st. simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and lady alicia whittington. the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of mr. aloysius doran, at lancaster gate, where breakfast had been prepared. it appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon lord st. simon. it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. the bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. on ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, mr. aloysius doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. there are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.' "

"and is that all?"

"only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one."

"and it is--"

"that miss flora millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. it appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. there are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the public press."

"and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. i would not have missed it for worlds. but there is a ring at the bell, watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. do not dream of going, watson, for i very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory."

"lord robert st. simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. a gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. his manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. his hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. as to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. he advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.

"good-day, lord st. simon," said holmes, rising and bowing. "pray take the basket-chair. this is my friend and colleague, dr. watson. draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over."

"a most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, mr. holmes. i have been cut to the quick. i understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of society."

"no, i am descending."

"i beg pardon."

"my last client of the sort was a king."

"oh, really! i had no idea. and which king?"

"the king of scandinavia."

"what! had he lost his wife?"

"you can understand," said holmes suavely, "that i extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours."

"of course! very right! very right! i'm sure i beg pardon. as to my own case, i am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion."

"thank you. i have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. i presume that i may take it as correct--this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride."

lord st. simon glanced over it. "yes, it is correct, as far as it goes."

"but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you."

"pray do so."

"when did you first meet miss hatty doran?"

"in san francisco, a year ago."

"you were travelling in the states?"

"yes."

"did you become engaged then?"

"no."

"but you were on a friendly footing?"

"i was amused by her society, and she could see that i was amused."

"her father is very rich?"

"he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope."

"and how did he make his money?"

"in mining. he had nothing a few years ago. then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."

"now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your wife's character?"

the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. "you see, mr. holmes," said he, "my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. during that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster. she is what we call in england a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. she is impetuous--volcanic, i was about to say. she is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. on the other hand, i would not have given her the name which i have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately cough--"had i not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. i believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."

"have you her photograph?"

"i brought this with me." he opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. it was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. then he closed the locket and handed it back to lord st. simon.

"the young lady came to london, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?"

"yes, her father brought her over for this last london season. i met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her."

"she brought, i understand, a considerable dowry?"

"a fair dowry. not more than is usual in my family."

"and this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?"

"i really have made no inquiries on the subject."

"very naturally not. did you see miss doran on the day before the wedding?"

"yes."

"was she in good spirits?"

"never better. she kept talking of what we should do in our future lives."

"indeed! that is very interesting. and on the morning of the wedding?"

"she was as bright as possible--at least until after the ceremony."

"and did you observe any change in her then?"

"well, to tell the truth, i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. the incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case."

"pray let us have it, for all that."

"oh, it is childish. she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. she was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. there was a moment's delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. yet when i spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."

"indeed! you say that there was a gentleman in the pew. some of the general public were present, then?"

"oh, yes. it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open."

"this gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"

"no, no; i call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. i hardly noticed his appearance. but really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point."

"lady st. simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. what did she do on re-entering her father's house?"

"i saw her in conversation with her maid."

"and who is her maid?"

"alice is her name. she is an american and came from california with her."

"a confidential servant?"

"a little too much so. it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. still, of course, in america they look upon these things in a different way."

"how long did she speak to this alice?"

"oh, a few minutes. i had something else to think of."

"you did not overhear what they said?"

"lady st. simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' she was accustomed to use slang of the kind. i have no idea what she meant."

"american slang is very expressive sometimes. and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"

"she walked into the breakfast-room."

"on your arm?"

"no, alone. she was very independent in little matters like that. then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. she never came back."

"but this maid, alice, as i understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out."

"quite so. and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at mr. doran's house that morning."

"ah, yes. i should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her."

lord st. simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. "we have been on a friendly footing for some years--i may say on a very friendly footing. she used to be at the allegro. i have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, mr. holmes. flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. she wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that i feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. she came to mr. doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and i had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row."

"did your wife hear all this?"

"no, thank goodness, she did not."

"and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"

"yes. that is what mr. lestrade, of scotland yard, looks upon as so serious. it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her."

"well, it is a possible supposition."

"you think so, too?"

"i did not say a probable one. but you do not yourself look upon this as likely?"

"i do not think flora would hurt a fly."

"still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. pray what is your own theory as to what took place?"

"well, really, i came to seek a theory, not to propound one. i have given you all the facts. since you ask me, however, i may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife."

"in short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"

"well, really, when i consider that she has turned her back--i will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success--i can hardly explain it in any other fashion."

"well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said holmes, smiling. "and now, lord st. simon, i think that i have nearly all my data. may i ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"

"we could see the other side of the road and the park."

"quite so. then i do not think that i need to detain you longer. i shall communicate with you."

"should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our client, rising.

"i have solved it."

"eh? what was that?"

"i say that i have solved it."

"where, then, is my wife?"

"that is a detail which i shall speedily supply."

lord st. simon shook his head. "i am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.

"it is very good of lord st. simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own," said sherlock holmes, laughing. "i think that i shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. i had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room."

"my dear holmes!"

"i have notes of several similar cases, though none, as i remarked before, which were quite as prompt. my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote thoreau's example."

"but i have heard all that you have heard."

"without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the franco-prussian war. it is one of these cases--but, hullo, here is lestrade! good-afternoon, lestrade! you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box."

the official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.

"what's up, then?" asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "you look dissatisfied."

"and i feel dissatisfied. it is this infernal st. simon marriage case. i can make neither head nor tail of the business."

"really! you surprise me."

"who ever heard of such a mixed affair? every clue seems to slip through my fingers. i have been at work upon it all day."

"and very wet it seems to have made you," said holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.

"yes, i have been dragging the serpentine."

"in heaven's name, what for?"

"in search of the body of lady st. simon."

sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.

"have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain?" he asked.

"why? what do you mean?"

"because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other."

lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "i suppose you know all about it," he snarled.

"well, i have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."

"oh, indeed! then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the matter?"

"i think it very unlikely."

"then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?" he opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. "there," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. "there is a little nut for you to crack, master holmes."

"oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. "you dragged them from the serpentine?"

"no. they were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. they have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."

"by the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?"

"at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance."

"i am afraid that you will find it difficult."

"are you, indeed, now?" cried lestrade with some bitterness. "i am afraid, holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. you have made two blunders in as many minutes. this dress does implicate miss flora millar."

"and how?"

"in the dress is a pocket. in the pocket is a card-case. in the card-case is a note. and here is the very note." he slapped it down upon the table in front of him. "listen to this: 'you will see me when all is ready. come at once. f. h. m.' now my theory all along has been that lady st. simon was decoyed away by flora millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach."

"very good, lestrade," said holmes, laughing. "you really are very fine indeed. let me see it." he took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. "this is indeed important," said he.

"ha! you find it so?"

"extremely so. i congratulate you warmly."

lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "why," he shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"

"on the contrary, this is the right side."

"the right side? you're mad! here is the note written in pencil over here."

"and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply."

"there's nothing in it. i looked at it before," said lestrade. " 'oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' i see nothing in that."

"very likely not. it is most important, all the same. as to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so i congratulate you again."

"i've wasted time enough," said lestrade, rising. "i believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. good-day, mr. holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first." he gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.

"just one hint to you, lestrade," drawled holmes before his rival vanished; "i will tell you the true solution of the matter. lady st. simon is a myth. there is not, and there never has been, any such person."

lestrade looked sadly at my companion. then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.

he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on his overcoat. "there is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work," he remarked, "so i think, watson, that i must leave you to your papers for a little."

it was after five o'clock when sherlock holmes left me, but i had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box. this he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. there were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the arabian nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.

just before nine o'clock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room. his features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.

"they have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.

"you seem to expect company. they have laid for five."

"yes, i fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "i am surprised that lord st. simon has not already arrived. ha! i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs."

it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.

"my messenger reached you, then?" asked holmes.

"yes, and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. have you good authority for what you say?"

"the best possible."

lord st. simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.

"what will the duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"

"it is the purest accident. i cannot allow that there is any humiliation."

"ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."

"i fail to see that anyone is to blame. i can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis."

"it was a slight, sir, a public slight," said lord st. simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.

"you must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position."

"i will make no allowance. i am very angry indeed, and i have been shamefully used."

"i think that i heard a ring," said holmes. "yes, there are steps on the landing. if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, lord st. simon, i have brought an advocate here who may be more successful." he opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. "lord st. simon," said he "allow me to introduce you to mr. and mrs. francis hay moulton. the lady, i think, you have already met."

at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. it was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.

"you're angry, robert," said she. "well, i guess you have every cause to be."

"pray make no apology to me," said lord st. simon bitterly.

"oh, yes, i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should have spoken to you before i went; but i was kind of rattled, and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didn't know what i was doing or saying. i only wonder i didn't fall down and do a faint right there before the altar."

"perhaps, mrs. moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?"

"if i may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman, "we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. for my part, i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it." he was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.

"then i'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "frank here and i met in '84, in mcquire's camp, near the rockies, where pa was working a claim. we were engaged to each other, frank and i; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. the richer pa grew the poorer was frank; so at last pa wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to 'frisco. frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it. it would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa. so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. 'why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and then i will feel sure of you; and i won't claim to be your husband until i come back?' well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then frank went off to seek his fortune, and i went back to pa.

"the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana, and then he went prospecting in arizona, and then i heard of him from new mexico. after that came a long newspaper story about how a miners' camp had been attacked by apache indians, and there was my frank's name among the killed. i fainted dead away, and i was very sick for months after. pa thought i had a decline and took me to half the doctors in 'frisco. not a word of news came for a year and more, so that i never doubted that frank was really dead. then lord st. simon came to 'frisco, and we came to london, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but i felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor frank.

"still, if i had married lord st. simon, of course i'd have done my duty by him. we can't command our love, but we can our actions. i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. but you may imagine what i felt when, just as i came to the altar rails, i glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. i thought it was his ghost at first; but when i looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him. i wonder i didn't drop. i know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. i didn't know what to do. should i stop the service and make a scene in the church? i glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what i was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and i knew that he was writing me a note. as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. it was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. of course i never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and i determined to do just whatever he might direct.

"when i got back i told my maid, who had known him in california, and had always been his friend. i ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. i know i ought to have spoken to lord st. simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. i hadn't been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road. he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park. i slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. some woman came talking something or other about lord st. simon to me--seemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also--but i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank. we got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. frank had been a prisoner among the apaches, had escaped, came on to 'frisco, found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding."

"i saw it in a paper," explained the american. "it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived."

"then we had a talk as to what we should do, and frank was all for openness, but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that i was alive. it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. so frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that i should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. it is likely that we should have gone on to paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, mr. holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than i can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st. simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. now, robert, you have heard it all, and i am very sorry if i have given you pain, and i hope that you do not think very meanly of me."

lord st. simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.

"excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner."

"then you won't forgive me? you won't shake hands before i go?"

"oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.

"i had hoped," suggested holmes, "that you would have joined us in a friendly supper."

"i think that there you ask a little too much," responded his lordship. "i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but i can hardly be expected to make merry over them. i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a very good-night." he included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.

"then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company," said sherlock holmes. "it is always a joy to meet an american, mr. moulton, for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes."

"the case has been an interesting one," remarked holmes when our visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by mr. lestrade of scotland yard."

"you were not yourself at fault at all, then?"

"from the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. what could that something be? she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. had she seen someone, then? if she had, it must be someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. you see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an american. then who could this american be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? it might be a lover; it might be a husband. her young womanhood had, i knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. so far i had got before i ever heard lord st. simon's narrative. when he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. she had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."

"and how in the world did you find them?"

"it might have been difficult, but friend lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. the initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels."

"how did you deduce the select?"

"by the select prices. eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. there are not many in london which charge at that rate. in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue, i learned by an inspection of the book that francis h. moulton, an american gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, i came upon the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill. his letters were to be forwarded to 226 gordon square; so thither i travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, i ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to lord st. simon in particular. i invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, i made him keep the appointment."

"but with no very good result," i remarked. "his conduct was certainly not very gracious."

"ah, watson," said holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. i think that we may judge lord st. simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings."

xi.  the adventure of the beryl coronet


"holmes," said i as i stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, "here is a madman coming along. it seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."

my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. it was a bright, crisp february morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. indeed, from the direction of the metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.

he was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. he was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. as he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.

"what on earth can be the matter with him?" i asked. "he is looking up at the numbers of the houses."

"i believe that he is coming here," said holmes, rubbing his hands.

"here?"

"yes; i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. i think that i recognise the symptoms. ha! did i not tell you?" as he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.

a few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. for a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.

"you have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he. "you are fatigued with your haste. pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then i shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me."

the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.

"no doubt you think me mad?" said he.

"i see that you have had some great trouble," responded holmes.

"god knows i have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. public disgrace i might have faced, although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. besides, it is not i alone. the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair."

"pray compose yourself, sir," said holmes, "and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you."

"my name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your ears. i am alexander holder, of the banking firm of holder & stevenson, of threadneedle street."

the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city of london. what could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass? we waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.

"i feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why i hastened here when the police inspector suggested that i should secure your co-operation. i came to baker street by the underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. that is why i was so out of breath, for i am a man who takes very little exercise. i feel better now, and i will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as i can.

"it is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. one of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. we have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.

"yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. i started when i saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you i had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in england. i was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.

" 'mr. holder,' said he, 'i have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.'

" 'the firm does so when the security is good.' i answered.

" 'it is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that i should have $50,000 at once. i could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but i much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. in my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one's self under obligations.'

" 'for how long, may i ask, do you want this sum?' i asked.

" 'next monday i have a large sum due to me, and i shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. but it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.'

" 'i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,' said i, 'were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. if, on the other hand, i am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner i must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.'

" 'i should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. 'you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet?'

" 'one of the most precious public possessions of the empire,' said i.

" 'precisely.' he opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. 'there are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. the lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked. i am prepared to leave it with you as my security.'

"i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.

" 'you doubt its value?' he asked.

" 'not at all. i only doubt--'

" 'the propriety of my leaving it. you may set your mind at rest about that. i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it. it is a pure matter of form. is the security sufficient?'

" 'ample.'

" 'you understand, mr. holder, that i am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which i have in you, founded upon all that i have heard of you. i rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because i need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. i leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and i shall call for it in person on monday morning.'

"seeing that my client was anxious to leave, i said no more but, calling for my cashier, i ordered him to pay over fifty $1000 notes. when i was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, i could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. there could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. i already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. however, it was too late to alter the matter now, so i locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.

"when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. bankers' safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? if so, how terrible would be the position in which i should find myself! i determined, therefore, that for the next few days i would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. with this intention, i called a cab and drove out to my house at streatham, carrying the jewel with me. i did not breathe freely until i had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.

"and now a word as to my household, mr. holmes, for i wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. my groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. i have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. another, lucy parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. she came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. she is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. that is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.

"so much for the servants. my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. i am a widower and have an only son, arthur. he has been a disappointment to me, mr. holmes--a grievous disappointment. i have no doubt that i am myself to blame. people tell me that i have spoiled him. very likely i have. when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i had to love. i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. i have never denied him a wish. perhaps it would have been better for both of us had i been sterner, but i meant it for the best.

"it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. he was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, i could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. he learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. he tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, sir george burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.

"and, indeed, i could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and i have found myself that i could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. he is older than arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. yet when i think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, i am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which i have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. so i think, and so, too, thinks my little mary, who has a woman's quick insight into character.

"and now there is only she to be described. she is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world i adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. she is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. she is my right hand. i do not know what i could do without her. in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. i think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!

"now, mr. holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and i shall continue with my miserable story.

"when we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, i told arthur and mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. lucy parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, i am sure, left the room; but i cannot swear that the door was closed. mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but i thought it better not to disturb it.

" 'where have you put it?' asked arthur.

" 'in my own bureau.'

" 'well, i hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night.' said he.

" 'it is locked up,' i answered.

" 'oh, any old key will fit that bureau. when i was a youngster i have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'

"he often had a wild way of talking, so that i thought little of what he said. he followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.

" 'look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let me have $200?'

" 'no, i cannot!' i answered sharply. 'i have been far too generous with you in money matters.'

" 'you have been very kind,' said he, 'but i must have this money, or else i can never show my face inside the club again.'

" 'and a very good thing, too!' i cried.

" 'yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,' said he. 'i could not bear the disgrace. i must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then i must try other means.'

"i was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. 'you shall not have a farthing from me,' i cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.

"when he was gone i unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. then i started to go round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which i usually leave to mary but which i thought it well to perform myself that night. as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as i approached.

" 'tell me, dad,' said she, looking, i thought, a little disturbed, 'did you give lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?'

" 'certainly not.'

" 'she came in just now by the back door. i have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but i think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'

" 'you must speak to her in the morning, or i will if you prefer it. are you sure that everything is fastened?'

" 'quite sure, dad.'

" 'then, good-night.' i kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where i was soon asleep.

"i am endeavouring to tell you everything, mr. holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but i beg that you will question me upon any point which i do not make clear."

"on the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."

"i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be particularly so. i am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. about two in the morning, then, i was awakened by some sound in the house. it had ceased ere i was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. i lay listening with all my ears. suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. i slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.

" 'arthur!' i screamed, 'you villain! you thief! how dare you touch that coronet?'

"the gas was half up, as i had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. he appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. at my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. i snatched it up and examined it. one of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.

" 'you blackguard!' i shouted, beside myself with rage. 'you have destroyed it! you have dishonoured me forever! where are the jewels which you have stolen?'

" 'stolen!' he cried.

" 'yes, thief!' i roared, shaking him by the shoulder.

" 'there are none missing. there cannot be any missing,' said he.

" 'there are three missing. and you know where they are. must i call you a liar as well as a thief? did i not see you trying to tear off another piece?'

" 'you have called me names enough,' said he, 'i will not stand it any longer. i shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. i will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.'

" 'you shall leave it in the hands of the police!' i cried half-mad with grief and rage. 'i shall have this matter probed to the bottom.'

" 'you shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such as i should not have thought was in his nature. 'if you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.'

"by this time the whole house was astir, for i had raised my voice in my anger. mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of arthur's face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. i sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. when the inspector and a constable entered the house, arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. i answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. i was determined that the law should have its way in everything.

" 'at least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. it would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for five minutes.'

" 'that you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,' said i. and then, realising the dreadful position in which i was placed, i implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than i was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. he might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.

" 'you may as well face the matter,' said i; 'you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. if you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'

" 'keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. i saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. there was but one way for it. i called in the inspector and gave him into custody. a search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. this morning he was removed to a cell, and i, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. you may go to any expense which you think necessary. i have already offered a reward of $1000. my god, what shall i do! i have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. oh, what shall i do!"

he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.

sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.

"do you receive much company?" he asked.

"none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of arthur's. sir george burnwell has been several times lately. no one else, i think."

"do you go out much in society?"

"arthur does. mary and i stay at home. we neither of us care for it."

"that is unusual in a young girl."

"she is of a quiet nature. besides, she is not so very young. she is four-and-twenty."

"this matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also."

"terrible! she is even more affected than i."

"you have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"

"how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands."

"i hardly consider that a conclusive proof. was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?"

"yes, it was twisted."

"do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?"

"god bless you! you are doing what you can for him and for me. but it is too heavy a task. what was he doing there at all? if his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"

"precisely. and if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? his silence appears to me to cut both ways. there are several singular points about the case. what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?"

"they considered that it might be caused by arthur's closing his bedroom door."

"a likely story! as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. what did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?"

"they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them."

"have they thought of looking outside the house?"

"yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. the whole garden has already been minutely examined."

"now, my dear sir," said holmes. "is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? it appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. consider what is involved by your theory. you suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. i ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"

"but what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of despair. "if his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?"

"it is our task to find that out," replied holmes; "so now, if you please, mr. holder, we will set off for streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details."

my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which i was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. i confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still i had such faith in holmes' judgment that i felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.

fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. a double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. on the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen's entrance. on the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. so long was he that mr. holder and i went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. she was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. i do not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.

"you have given orders that arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?" she asked.

"no, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."

"but i am so sure that he is innocent. you know what woman's instincts are. i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly."

"why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"

"who knows? perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him."

"how could i help suspecting him, when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?"

"oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. let the matter drop and say no more. it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison!"

"i shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, mary! your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. far from hushing the thing up, i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it."

"this gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.

"no, his friend. he wished us to leave him alone. he is round in the stable lane now."

"the stable lane?" she raised her dark eyebrows. "what can he hope to find there? ah! this, i suppose, is he. i trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what i feel sure is the truth, that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime."

"i fully share your opinion, and i trust, with you, that we may prove it," returned holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. "i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary holder. might i ask you a question or two?"

"pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."

"you heard nothing yourself last night?"

"nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. i heard that, and i came down."

"you shut up the windows and doors the night before. did you fasten all the windows?"

"yes."

"were they all fastened this morning?"

"yes."

"you have a maid who has a sweetheart? i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?"

"yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet."

"i see. you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery."

"but what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the banker impatiently, "when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands?"

"wait a little, mr. holder. we must come back to that. about this girl, miss holder. you saw her return by the kitchen door, i presume?"

"yes; when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met her slipping in. i saw the man, too, in the gloom."

"do you know him?"

"oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. his name is francis prosper."

"he stood," said holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"

"yes, he did."

"and he is a man with a wooden leg?"

something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive black eyes. "why, you are like a magician," said she. "how do you know that?" she smiled, but there was no answering smile in holmes' thin, eager face.

"i should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up."

he walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. "now we shall go upstairs," said he at last.

the banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.

"which key was used to open it?" he asked.

"that which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the lumber-room."

"have you it here?"

"that is it on the dressing-table."

sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau.

"it is a noiseless lock," said he. "it is no wonder that it did not wake you. this case, i presume, contains the coronet. we must have a look at it." he opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. it was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that i have ever seen. at one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.

"now, mr. holder," said holmes, "here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. might i beg that you will break it off."

the banker recoiled in horror. "i should not dream of trying," said he.

"then i will." holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. "i feel it give a little," said he; "but, though i am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. an ordinary man could not do it. now, what do you think would happen if i did break it, mr. holder? there would be a noise like a pistol shot. do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?"

"i do not know what to think. it is all dark to me."

"but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. what do you think, miss holder?"

"i confess that i still share my uncle's perplexity."

"your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"

"he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."

"thank you. we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. with your permission, mr. holder, i shall now continue my investigations outside."

he went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. for an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.

"i think that i have seen now all that there is to see, mr. holder," said he; "i can serve you best by returning to my rooms."

"but the gems, mr. holmes. where are they?"

"i cannot tell."

the banker wrung his hands. "i shall never see them again!" he cried. "and my son? you give me hopes?"

"my opinion is in no way altered."

"then, for god's sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?"

"if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it clearer. i understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that i get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum i may draw."

"i would give my fortune to have them back."

"very good. i shall look into the matter between this and then. good-bye; it is just possible that i may have to come over here again before evening."

it was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than i could even dimly imagine. several times during our homeward journey i endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last i gave it over in despair. it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. he hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. with his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.

"i think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. "i only wish that you could come with me, watson, but i fear that it won't do. i may be on the trail in this matter, or i may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but i shall soon know which it is. i hope that i may be back in a few hours." he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.

i had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.

"i only looked in as i passed," said he. "i am going right on."

"where to?"

"oh, to the other side of the west end. it may be some time before i get back. don't wait up for me in case i should be late."

"how are you getting on?"

"oh, so so. nothing to complain of. i have been out to streatham since i saw you last, but i did not call at the house. it is a very sweet little problem, and i would not have missed it for a good deal. however, i must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self."

i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. his eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. he hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later i heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.

i waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so i retired to my room. it was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. i do not know at what hour he came in, but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.

"you will excuse my beginning without you, watson," said he, "but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning."

"why, it is after nine now," i answered. "i should not be surprised if that were he. i thought i heard a ring."

it was, indeed, our friend the financier. i was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. he entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which i pushed forward for him.

"i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried," said he. "only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. my niece, mary, has deserted me."

"deserted you?"

"yes. her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. i had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. it is to that remark that she refers in this note:

" 'my dearest uncle:--i feel that i have brought trouble upon you, and that if i had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. i cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and i feel that i must leave you forever. do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. in life or in death, i am ever your loving


" 'mary.'

"what could she mean by that note, mr. holmes? do you think it points to suicide?"

"no, no, nothing of the kind. it is perhaps the best possible solution. i trust, mr. holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles."

"ha! you say so! you have heard something, mr. holmes; you have learned something! where are the gems?"

"you would not think $1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?"

"i would pay ten."

"that would be unnecessary. three thousand will cover the matter. and there is a little reward, i fancy. have you your check-book? here is a pen. better make it out for $4000."

with a dazed face the banker made out the required check. holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.

with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.

"you have it!" he gasped. "i am saved! i am saved!"

the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.

"there is one other thing you owe, mr. holder," said sherlock holmes rather sternly.

"owe!" he caught up a pen. "name the sum, and i will pay it."

"no, the debt is not to me. you owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as i should be proud to see my own son do, should i ever chance to have one."

"then it was not arthur who took them?"

"i told you yesterday, and i repeat to-day, that it was not."

"you are sure of it! then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known."

"he knows it already. when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, i told it to him, on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. your news of this morning, however, may open his lips."

"for heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!"

"i will do so, and i will show you the steps by which i reached it. and let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between sir george burnwell and your niece mary. they have now fled together."

"my mary? impossible!"

"it is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. he is one of the most dangerous men in england--a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. your niece knew nothing of such men. when he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. the devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening."

"i cannot, and i will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an ashen face.

"i will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. his footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. she told him of the coronet. his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. i have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and i think that she must have been one. she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.

"your boy, arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. she passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. he saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.

"as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. but the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. he rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. sir george burnwell tried to get away, but arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. in the scuffle, your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye. then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene."

"is it possible?" gasped the banker.

"you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. he took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret."

"and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet," cried mr. holder. "oh, my god! what a blind fool i have been! and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. how cruelly i have misjudged him!"

"when i arrived at the house," continued holmes, "i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. i knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. i passed along the tradesmen's path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. i could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. i thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. i passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which i took to be the police; but when i got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.

"there was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. the first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. i followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. then i walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. i saw where boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that i was not mistaken. boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. when he came to the highroad at the other end, i found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.

"on entering the house, however, i examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and i could at once see that someone had passed out. i could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. a man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. he had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. so far i was clear. the question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?

"it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. now, i knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. but if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? there could be no possible reason. as he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. when i remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.

"and who could it be who was her confederate? a lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? i knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. but among them was sir george burnwell. i had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. it must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. even though he knew that arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.

"well, your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next. i went in the shape of a loafer to sir george's house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."

"i saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening," said mr. holder.

"precisely. it was i. i found that i had my man, so i came home and changed my clothes. it was a delicate part which i had to play then, for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. i went and saw him. at first, of course, he denied everything. but when i gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. i knew my man, however, and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. then he became a little more reasonable. i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held--$1000 apiece. that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'why, dash it all!' said he, 'i've let them go at six hundred for the three!' i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. off i set to him, and after much chaffering i got our stones at $1000 apiece. then i looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after what i may call a really hard day's work."

"a day which has saved england from a great public scandal," said the banker, rising. "sir, i cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it. and now i must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which i have done him. as to what you tell me of poor mary, it goes to my very heart. not even your skill can inform me where she is now."

"i think that we may safely say," returned holmes, "that she is wherever sir george burnwell is. it is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment."

xii.  the adventure of the copper beeches


"to the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked sherlock holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the daily telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. it is pleasant to me to observe, watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, i am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province."

"and yet," said i, smiling, "i cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records."

"you have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing."

"it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter," i remarked with some coldness, for i was repelled by the egotism which i had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character.

"no, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "if i claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a thing beyond myself. crime is common. logic is rare. therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales."

it was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at baker street. a thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.

"at the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, "you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. the small matter in which i endeavoured to help the king of bohemia, the singular experience of miss mary sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. but in avoiding the sensational, i fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."

"the end may have been so," i answered, "but the methods i hold to have been novel and of interest."

"pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! but, indeed, if you are trivial. i cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. as to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. i think that i have touched bottom at last, however. this note i had this morning marks my zero-point, i fancy. read it!" he tossed a crumpled letter across to me.

it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:

"dear mr. holmes:--i am very anxious to consult you as to whether i should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. i shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if i do not inconvenience you. yours faithfully,


"violet hunter."

"do you know the young lady?" i asked.

"not i."

"it is half-past ten now."

"yes, and i have no doubt that is her ring."

"it may turn out to be of more interest than you think. you remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. it may be so in this case, also."

"well, let us hope so. but our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless i am much mistaken, is the person in question."

as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. she was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.

"you will excuse my troubling you, i am sure," said she, as my companion rose to greet her, "but i have had a very strange experience, and as i have no parents or relations of any sort from whom i could ask advice, i thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what i should do."

"pray take a seat, miss hunter. i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you."

i could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. he looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.

"i have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the family of colonel spence munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at halifax, in nova scotia, and took his children over to america with him, so that i found myself without a situation. i advertised, and i answered advertisements, but without success. at last the little money which i had saved began to run short, and i was at my wit's end as to what i should do.

"there is a well-known agency for governesses in the west end called westaway's, and there i used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by miss stoper. she sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.

"well, when i called last week i was shown into the little office as usual, but i found that miss stoper was not alone. a prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. as i came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to miss stoper.

" 'that will do,' said he; 'i could not ask for anything better. capital! capital!' he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. he was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.

" 'you are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.

" 'yes, sir.'

" 'as governess?'

" 'yes, sir.'

" 'and what salary do you ask?'

" 'i had $4 a month in my last place with colonel spence munro.'

" 'oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. 'how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?'

" 'my accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said i. 'a little french, a little german, music, and drawing--'

" 'tut, tut!' he cried. 'this is all quite beside the question. the point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? there it is in a nutshell. if you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. but if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? your salary with me, madam, would commence at $100 a year.'

"you may imagine, mr. holmes, that to me, destitute as i was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. the gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.

" 'it is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'

"it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. as i was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before i quite committed myself.

" 'may i ask where you live, sir?' said i.

" 'hampshire. charming rural place. the copper beeches, five miles on the far side of winchester. it is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'

" 'and my duties, sir? i should be glad to know what they would be.'

" 'one child--one dear little romper just six years old. oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! smack! smack! smack! three gone before you could wink!' he leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.

"i was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement, but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.

" 'my sole duties, then,' i asked, 'are to take charge of a single child?'

" 'no, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he cried. 'your duty would be, as i am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. you see no difficulty, heh?'

" 'i should be happy to make myself useful.'

" 'quite so. in dress now, for example. we are faddy people, you know--faddy but kind-hearted. if you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. heh?'

" 'no,' said i, considerably astonished at his words.

" 'or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?'

" 'oh, no.'

" 'or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'

"i could hardly believe my ears. as you may observe, mr. holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. it has been considered artistic. i could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.

" 'i am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said i. he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and i could see a shadow pass over his face as i spoke.

" 'i am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'it is a little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam, ladies' fancies must be consulted. and so you won't cut your hair?'

" 'no, sir, i really could not,' i answered firmly.

" 'ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. it is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. in that case, miss stoper, i had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.'

"the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that i could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.

" 'do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked.

" 'if you please, miss stoper.'

" 'well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'you can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. good-day to you, miss hunter.' she struck a gong upon the table, and i was shown out by the page.

"well, mr. holmes, when i got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table. i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very foolish thing. after all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. very few governesses in england are getting $100 a year. besides, what use was my hair to me? many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps i should be among the number. next day i was inclined to think that i had made a mistake, and by the day after i was sure of it. i had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when i received this letter from the gentleman himself. i have it here and i will read it to you:


" 'the copper beeches, near winchester.

" 'dear miss hunter:--miss stoper has very kindly given me your address, and i write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. my wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. we are willing to give $30 a quarter, or $120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. they are not very exacting, after all. my wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. you need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter alice (now in philadelphia), which would, i should think, fit you very well. then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. as regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as i could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but i am afraid that i must remain firm upon this point, and i only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. now do try to come, and i shall meet you with the dog-cart at winchester. let me know your train. yours faithfully,


" 'jephro rucastle.'

"that is the letter which i have just received, mr. holmes, and my mind is made up that i will accept it. i thought, however, that before taking the final step i should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration."

"well, miss hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question," said holmes, smiling.

"but you would not advise me to refuse?"

"i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for."

"what is the meaning of it all, mr. holmes?"

"ah, i have no data. i cannot tell. perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?"

"well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. mr. rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?"

"that is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady."

"but the money, mr. holmes, the money!"

"well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. that is what makes me uneasy. why should they give you $120 a year, when they could have their pick for $40? there must be some strong reason behind."

"i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if i wanted your help. i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me."

"oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. i assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. there is something distinctly novel about some of the features. if you should find yourself in doubt or in danger--"

"danger! what danger do you foresee?"

holmes shook his head gravely. "it would cease to be a danger if we could define it," said he. "but at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help."

"that is enough." she rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. "i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my mind now. i shall write to mr. rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for winchester to-morrow." with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.

"at least," said i as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself."

"and she would need to be," said holmes gravely. "i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."

it was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled. a fortnight went by, during which i frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. the unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. as to holmes, i observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when i mentioned it. "data! data! data!" he cried impatiently. "i can't make bricks without clay." and yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.

the telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as i was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when i would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when i came down to breakfast in the morning. he opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.

"just look up the trains in bradshaw," said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.

the summons was a brief and urgent one.

"please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday to-morrow," it said. "do come! i am at my wit's end.


"hunter."

"will you come with me?" asked holmes, glancing up.

"i should wish to."

"just look it up, then."

"there is a train at half-past nine," said i, glancing over my bradshaw. "it is due at winchester at 11:30."

"that will do very nicely. then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning."

by eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old english capital. holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. it was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. the sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man's energy. all over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.

"are they not fresh and beautiful?" i cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street.

but holmes shook his head gravely.

"do you know, watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. you look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. i look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there."

"good heavens!" i cried. "who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?"

"they always fill me with a certain horror. it is my belief, watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."

"you horrify me!"

"but the reason is very obvious. the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. but look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester, i should never have had a fear for her. it is the five miles of country which makes the danger. still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened."

"no. if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away."

"quite so. she has her freedom."

"what can be the matter, then? can you suggest no explanation?"

"i have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell."

the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. she had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.

"i am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "it is so very kind of you both; but indeed i do not know what i should do. your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."

"pray tell us what has happened to you."

"i will do so, and i must be quick, for i have promised mr. rucastle to be back before three. i got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."

"let us have everything in its due order." holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.

"in the first place, i may say that i have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from mr. and mrs. rucastle. it is only fair to them to say that. but i cannot understand them, and i am not easy in my mind about them."

"what can you not understand?"

"their reasons for their conduct. but you shall have it all just as it occurred. when i came down, mr. rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the copper beeches. it is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. there are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. this ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of lord southerton's preserves. a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.

"i was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. there was no truth, mr. holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at baker street. mrs. rucastle is not mad. i found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, i should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. from their conversation i have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia. mr. rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. as the daughter could not have been less than twenty, i can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife.

"mrs. rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. she was a nonentity. it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. he was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. and yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. she would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. more than once i have surprised her in tears. i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for i have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. he is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. but i would rather not talk about the creature, mr. holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story."

"i am glad of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they seem to you to be relevant or not."

"i shall try not to miss anything of importance. the one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. there are only two, a man and his wife. toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. twice since i have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet mr. rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as mrs. rucastle and much less amiable. they are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately i spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.

"for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, mrs. rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.

" 'oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to you, miss hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. we shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.'

"the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. it was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. it could not have been a better fit if i had been measured for it. both mr. and mrs. rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. they were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. a chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. in this i was asked to sit, and then mr. rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that i have ever listened to. you cannot imagine how comical he was, and i laughed until i was quite weary. mrs. rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. after an hour or so, mr. rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in the nursery.

"two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. again i changed my dress, again i sat in the window, and again i laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire, and which he told inimitably. then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. i read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.

"you can easily imagine, mr. holmes, how curious i became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. they were always very careful, i observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. at first it seemed to be impossible, but i soon devised a means. my hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and i concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. on the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, i put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. i confess that i was disappointed. there was nothing. at least that was my first impression. at the second glance, however, i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. the road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. this man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. i lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs. rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. she said nothing, but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. she rose at once.

" 'jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter.'

" 'no friend of yours, miss hunter?' he asked.

" 'no, i know no one in these parts.'

" 'dear me! how very impertinent! kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.'

" 'surely it would be better to take no notice.'

" 'no, no, we should have him loitering here always. kindly turn round and wave him away like that.'

"i did as i was told, and at the same instant mrs. rucastle drew down the blind. that was a week ago, and from that time i have not sat again in the window, nor have i worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road."

"pray continue," said holmes. "your narrative promises to be a most interesting one."

"you will find it rather disconnected, i fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak. on the very first day that i was at the copper beeches, mr. rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. as we approached it i heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.

" 'look in here!' said mr. rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. 'is he not a beauty?'

"i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.

" 'don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start which i had given. 'it's only carlo, my mastiff. i call him mine, but really old toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. we feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. toller lets him loose every night, and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. for goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life is worth.'

"the warning was no idle one, for two nights later i happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning. it was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. i was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when i was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. as it emerged into the moonshine i saw what it was. it was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not think that any burglar could have done.

"and now i have a very strange experience to tell you. i had, as you know, cut off my hair in london, and i had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. one evening, after the child was in bed, i began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. there was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. i had filled the first two with my linen, and as i had still much to pack away i was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. the very first key fitted to perfection, and i drew the drawer open. there was only one thing in it, but i am sure that you would never guess what it was. it was my coil of hair.

"i took it up and examined it. it was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. how could my hair have been locked in the drawer? with trembling hands i undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. i laid the two tresses together, and i assure you that they were identical. was it not extraordinary? puzzle as i would, i could make nothing at all of what it meant. i returned the strange hair to the drawer, and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.

"i am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, mr. holmes, and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. there was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. a door which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. one day, however, as i ascended the stair, i met mr. rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom i was accustomed. his cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.

"this aroused my curiosity, so when i went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, i strolled round to the side from which i could see the windows of this part of the house. there were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. they were evidently all deserted. as i strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, mr. rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.

" 'ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if i passed you without a word, my dear young lady. i was preoccupied with business matters.'

"i assured him that i was not offended. 'by the way,' said i, 'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.'

"he looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.

" 'photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'i have made my dark room up there. but, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. who would have believed it? who would have ever believed it?' he spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. i read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.

"well, mr. holmes, from the moment that i understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know, i was all on fire to go over them. it was not mere curiosity, though i have my share of that. it was more a feeling of duty--a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. they talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's instinct which gave me that feeling. at any rate, it was there, and i was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.

"it was only yesterday that the chance came. i may tell you that, besides mr. rucastle, both toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and i once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when i came upstairs there was the key in the door. i have no doubt at all that he had left it there. mr. and mrs. rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that i had an admirable opportunity. i turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.

"there was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. they each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. the centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. the door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. as i stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. a mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, mr. holmes. my overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and i turned and ran--ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. i rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of mr. rucastle, who was waiting outside.

" 'so,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. i thought that it must be when i saw the door open.'

" 'oh, i am so frightened!' i panted.

" 'my dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?'

"but his voice was just a little too coaxing. he overdid it. i was keenly on my guard against him.

" 'i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' i answered. 'but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was frightened and ran out again. oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!'

" 'only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.

" 'why, what did you think?' i asked.

" 'why do you think that i lock this door?'

" 'i am sure that i do not know.'

" 'it is to keep people out who have no business there. do you see?' he was still smiling in the most amiable manner.

" 'i am sure if i had known--'

" 'well, then, you know now. and if you ever put your foot over that threshold again'--here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon--'i'll throw you to the mastiff.'

"i was so terrified that i do not know what i did. i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room. i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. then i thought of you, mr. holmes. i could not live there longer without some advice. i was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. they were all horrible to me. if i could only bring you down all would be well. of course i might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. my mind was soon made up. i would send you a wire. i put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning, but i must be back before three o'clock, for mr. and mrs. rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that i must look after the child. now i have told you all my adventures, mr. holmes, and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what i should do."

holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. my friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.

"is toller still drunk?" he asked.

"yes. i heard his wife tell mrs. rucastle that she could do nothing with him."

"that is well. and the rucastles go out to-night?"

"yes."

"is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"

"yes, the wine-cellar."

"you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, miss hunter. do you think that you could perform one more feat? i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman."

"i will try. what is it?"

"we shall be at the copper beeches by seven o'clock, my friend and i. the rucastles will be gone by that time, and toller will, we hope, be incapable. there only remains mrs. toller, who might give the alarm. if you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely."

"i will do it."

"excellent! we shall then look thoroughly into the affair. of course there is only one feasible explanation. you have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. that is obvious. as to who this prisoner is, i have no doubt that it is the daughter, miss alice rucastle, if i remember right, who was said to have gone to america. you were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. by a curious chance you came upon her tresses. the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--and no doubt, as you wore the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that miss rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. so much is fairly clear. the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child."

"what on earth has that to do with it?" i ejaculated.

"my dear watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. don't you see that the converse is equally valid. i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. this child's disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as i should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power."

"i am sure that you are right, mr. holmes," cried our client. "a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature."

"we must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. we can do nothing until seven o'clock. at that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery."

we were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. the group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.

"have you managed it?" asked holmes.

a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "that is mrs. toller in the cellar," said she. "her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. here are his keys, which are the duplicates of mr. rucastle's."

"you have done well indeed!" cried holmes with enthusiasm. "now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business."

we passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described. holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. no sound came from within, and at the silence holmes' face clouded over.

"i trust that we are not too late," said he. "i think, miss hunter, that we had better go in without you. now, watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in."

it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. together we rushed into the room. it was empty. there was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. the skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.

"there has been some villainy here," said holmes; "this beauty has guessed miss hunter's intentions and has carried his victim off."

"but how?"

"through the skylight. we shall soon see how he managed it." he swung himself up onto the roof. "ah, yes," he cried, "here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. that is how he did it."

"but it is impossible," said miss hunter; "the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away."

"he has come back and done it. i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair. i think, watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."

the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him.

"you villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"

the fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.

"it is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! spies and thieves! i have caught you, have i? you are in my power. i'll serve you!" he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.

"he's gone for the dog!" cried miss hunter.

"i have my revolver," said i.

"better close the front door," cried holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.

"my god!" he cried. "someone has loosed the dog. it's not been fed for two days. quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"

holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house, with toller hurrying behind us. there was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in rucastle's throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. running up, i blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. with much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. we laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife, i did what i could to relieve his pain. we were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.

"mrs. toller!" cried miss hunter.

"yes, miss. mr. rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know what you were planning, for i would have told you that your pains were wasted."

"ha!" said holmes, looking keenly at her. "it is clear that mrs. toller knows more about this matter than anyone else."

"yes, sir, i do, and i am ready enough to tell what i know."

"then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark."

"i will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and i'd have done so before now if i could ha' got out from the cellar. if there's police-court business over this, you'll remember that i was the one that stood your friend, and that i was miss alice's friend too.

"she was never happy at home, miss alice wasn't, from the time that her father married again. she was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr. fowler at a friend's house. as well as i could learn, miss alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr. rucastle's hands. he knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. he wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. when she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."

"ah," said holmes, "i think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that i can deduce all that remains. mr. rucastle then, i presume, took to this system of imprisonment?"

"yes, sir."

"and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr. fowler."

"that was it, sir."

"but mr. fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his."

"mr. fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said mrs. toller serenely.

"and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out."

"you have it, sir, just as it happened."

"i am sure we owe you an apology, mrs. toller," said holmes, "for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. and here comes the country surgeon and mrs. rucastle, so i think, watson, that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one."

and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. mr. rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. they still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of rucastle's past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. mr. fowler and miss rucastle were married, by special license, in southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of mauritius. as to miss violet hunter, my friend holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at walsall, where i believe that she has met with considerable success.

information about project gutenberg (one page)

we produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  the
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any ebook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  if the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more ebooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
we are already on our way to trying for 2000 more ebooks in 2002
if they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion ebooks given away by year's end.

the goal of project gutenberg is to give away 1 trillion ebooks!
this is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

preface


as things now stand, the course of instruction in american history in
our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject.
three separate books are used. first, there is the primary book, which
is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and
anecdotes. second, there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth
grade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary book by the
addition of forty or fifty thousand words. finally, there is the high
school manual. this, too, ordinarily follows the beaten path, giving
fuller accounts of the same events and characters. to put it bluntly, we
do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their
study of history in the lower grades. if mathematicians followed the
same method, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the
multiplication table and fractions.

there is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. it
is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history
their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. no teacher of
history will deny this. still it is a standing challenge to existing
methods of historical instruction. if the study of history cannot be
made truly progressive like the study of mathematics, science, and
languages, then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding
their subject to the already overloaded curriculum. if the successive
historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text--more
facts, more dates, more words--then history deserves most of the sharp
criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and
economics.

in this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a
new high school text in american history. our first contribution is one
of omission. the time-honored stories of exploration and the
biographies of heroes are left out. we frankly hold that, if pupils know
little or nothing about columbus, cortes, magellan, or captain john
smith by the time they reach the high school, it is useless to tell the
same stories for perhaps the fourth time. it is worse than useless. it
is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are
demonstrated to be progressive in character.

in the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles. our
reasons for this are simple. the strategy of a campaign or of a single
battle is a highly technical, and usually a highly controversial, matter
about which experts differ widely. in the field of military and naval
operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. to
dispose of gettysburg or the wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is
equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. any one who
compares the ordinary textbook account of a single civil war campaign
with the account given by ropes, for instance, will ask for no further
comment. no youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think
of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of
warfare. the dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the
interest of the immature pupil, seems out of place in a book that
deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's
serious responsibilities.

it is not upon negative features, however, that we rest our case. it is
rather upon constructive features.

_first._ we have written a topical, not a narrative, history. we have
tried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of
each period, bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration.

_second._ we have emphasized those historical topics which help to
explain how our nation has come to be what it is to-day.

_third._ we have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our
history, especially in relation to the politics of each period.

_fourth._ we have treated the causes and results of wars, the problems
of financing and sustaining armed forces, rather than military strategy.
these are the subjects which belong to a history for civilians. these
are matters which civilians can understand--matters which they must
understand, if they are to play well their part in war and peace.

_fifth._ by omitting the period of exploration, we have been able to
enlarge the treatment of our own time. we have given special attention
to the history of those current questions which must form the subject
matter of sound instruction in citizenship.

_sixth._ we have borne in mind that america, with all her unique
characteristics, is a part of a general civilization. accordingly we
have given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations, and the
reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place.

_seventh._ we have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity. the
study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory. we
have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association,
reflection, and generalization--habits calculated to enlarge as well as
inform the mind. we have been at great pains to make our text clear,
simple, and direct; but we have earnestly sought to stretch the
intellects of our readers--to put them upon their mettle. most of them
will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school.
the world will soon expect maturity from them. their achievements will
depend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone. the
effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by
the excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their
information.

history of the united states




part i. the colonial period




chapter i

the great migration to america


the tide of migration that set in toward the shores of north america
during the early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in
the restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the
earth. the ancient greeks flung out their colonies in every direction,
westward as far as gaul, across the mediterranean, and eastward into
asia minor, perhaps to the very confines of india. the romans, supported
by their armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the
narrow lands of italy until it stretched from the heather of scotland to
the sands of arabia. the teutonic tribes, from their home beyond the
danube and the rhine, poured into the empire of the caesars and made the
beginnings of modern europe. of this great sweep of races and empires
the settlement of america was merely a part. and it was, moreover, only
one aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples, the
institutions, and the trade of europe to the very ends of the earth.

in one vital point, it must be noted, american colonization differed
from that of the ancients. the greeks usually carried with them
affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the
altar of the parent city; but thousands of the immigrants who came to
america disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother
country. they established compacts of government for themselves and set
up altars of their own. they sought not only new soil to till but also
political and religious liberty for themselves and their children.


the agencies of american colonization

it was no light matter for the english to cross three thousand miles of
water and found homes in the american wilderness at the opening of the
seventeenth century. ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlays
of money. stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain
the life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own.
artisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk
the hazards of the new world. soldiers were required for defense and
mariners for the exploration of inland waters. leaders of good judgment,
adept in managing men, had to be discovered. altogether such an
enterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or
gentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to
assume. though in later days, after initial tests had been made, wealthy
proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account, it was
the corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the
beginning.

=the trading company.=--english pioneers in exploration found an
instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, which
had long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries.
such a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of
society--noblemen, merchants, and gentlemen--who banded together for a
particular undertaking, each contributing a sum of money and sharing in
the profits of the venture. it was organized under royal authority; it
received its charter, its grant of land, and its trading privileges from
the king and carried on its operations under his supervision and
control. the charter named all the persons originally included in the
corporation and gave them certain powers in the management of its
affairs, including the right to admit new members. the company was in
fact a little government set up by the king. when the members of the
corporation remained in england, as in the case of the virginia company,
they operated through agents sent to the colony. when they came over the
seas themselves and settled in america, as in the case of massachusetts,
they became the direct government of the country they possessed. the
stockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor, the
chief magistrate.

[illustration: john winthrop, governor of the massachusetts bay
company]

four of the thirteen colonies in america owed their origins to the
trading corporation. it was the london company, created by king james i,
in 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations of virginia
at jamestown. it was under the auspices of their west india company,
chartered in 1621, that the dutch planted the settlements of the new
netherland in the valley of the hudson. the founders of massachusetts
were puritan leaders and men of affairs whom king charles i incorporated
in 1629 under the title: "the governor and company of the massachusetts
bay in new england." in this case the law did but incorporate a group
drawn together by religious ties. "we must be knit together as one man,"
wrote john winthrop, the first puritan governor in america. far to the
south, on the banks of the delaware river, a swedish commercial company
in 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement, christened new sweden; it
was destined to pass under the rule of the dutch, and finally under the
rule of william penn as the proprietary colony of delaware.

in a certain sense, georgia may be included among the "company
colonies." it was, however, originally conceived by the moving spirit,
james oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those imprisoned
for debt. to realize this humane purpose, he secured from king george
ii, in 1732, a royal charter uniting several gentlemen, including
himself, into "one body politic and corporate," known as the "trustees
for establishing the colony of georgia in america." in the structure of
their organization and their methods of government, the trustees did not
differ materially from the regular companies created for trade and
colonization. though their purposes were benevolent, their transactions
had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business.

=the religious congregation.=--a second agency which figured largely in
the settlement of america was the religious brotherhood, or
congregation, of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common
religious faith. by one of the strange fortunes of history, this
institution, founded in the early days of christianity, proved to be a
potent force in the origin and growth of self-government in a land far
away from galilee. "and the multitude of them that believed were of one
heart and of one soul," we are told in the acts describing the church at
jerusalem. "we are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of
the lord ... by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all
care of each other's good and of the whole," wrote john robinson, a
leader among the pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of plymouth in
1620. the mayflower compact, so famous in american history, was but a
written and signed agreement, incorporating the spirit of obedience to
the common good, which served as a guide to self-government until
plymouth was annexed to massachusetts in 1691.

[illustration: the original grants]

three other colonies, all of which retained their identity until the eve
of the american revolution, likewise sprang directly from the
congregations of the faithful: rhode island, connecticut, and new
hampshire, mainly offshoots from massachusetts. they were founded by
small bodies of men and women, "united in solemn covenants with the
lord," who planted their settlements in the wilderness. not until many a
year after roger williams and anne hutchinson conducted their followers
to the narragansett country was rhode island granted a charter of
incorporation (1663) by the crown. not until long after the congregation
of thomas hooker from newtown blazed the way into the connecticut river
valley did the king of england give connecticut a charter of its own
(1662) and a place among the colonies. half a century elapsed before the
towns laid out beyond the merrimac river by emigrants from massachusetts
were formed into the royal province of new hampshire in 1679.

even when connecticut was chartered, the parchment and sealing wax of
the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self-government
and obedience to law previously established by the congregations. the
towns of hartford, windsor, and wethersfield had long lived happily
under their "fundamental orders" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had
the settlers dwelt peacefully at new haven under their "fundamental
articles" drafted in the same year. the pioneers on the connecticut
shore had no difficulty in agreeing that "the scriptures do hold forth a
perfect rule for the direction and government of all men."

=the proprietor.=--a third and very important colonial agency was the
proprietor, or proprietary. as the name, associated with the word
"property," implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king
granted property in lands in north america to have, hold, use, and enjoy
for his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand the estate down
to his heirs in perpetual succession. the proprietor was a rich and
powerful person, prepared to furnish or secure the capital, collect the
ships, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers necessary to found
and sustain a plantation beyond the seas. sometimes the proprietor
worked alone. sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the
common undertaking.

five colonies, maryland, pennsylvania, new jersey, and the carolinas,
owe their formal origins, though not always their first settlements, nor
in most cases their prosperity, to the proprietary system. maryland,
established in 1634 under a catholic nobleman, lord baltimore, and
blessed with religious toleration by the act of 1649, flourished under
the mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the american
union. new jersey, beginning its career under two proprietors, berkeley
and carteret, in 1664, passed under the direct government of the crown
in 1702. pennsylvania was, in a very large measure, the product of the
generous spirit and tireless labors of its first proprietor, the leader
of the friends, william penn, to whom it was granted in 1681 and in
whose family it remained until 1776. the two carolinas were first
organized as one colony in 1663 under the government and patronage of
eight proprietors, including lord clarendon; but after more than half a
century both became royal provinces governed by the king.

the colonial peoples

=the english.=--in leadership and origin the thirteen colonies, except
new york and delaware, were english. during the early days of all, save
these two, the main, if not the sole, current of immigration was from
england. the colonists came from every walk of life. they were men,
women, and children of "all sorts and conditions." the major portion
were yeomen, or small land owners, farm laborers, and artisans. with
them were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of goods or
their fortunes to the new world. scholars came from oxford and
cambridge to preach the gospel or to teach. now and then the son of an
english nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with
america. the people represented every religious faith--members of the
established church of england; puritans who had labored to reform that
church; separatists, baptists, and friends, who had left it altogether;
and catholics, who clung to the religion of their fathers.

new england was almost purely english. during the years between 1629 and
1640, the period of arbitrary stuart government, about twenty thousand
puritans emigrated to america, settling in the colonies of the far
north. although minor additions were made from time to time, the greater
portion of the new england people sprang from this original stock.
virginia, too, for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from
england alone. not until the eve of the revolution did other
nationalities, mainly the scotch-irish and germans, rival the english in
numbers.

the populations of later english colonies--the carolinas, new york,
pennsylvania, and georgia--while receiving a steady stream of
immigration from england, were constantly augmented by wanderers from
the older settlements. new york was invaded by puritans from new england
in such numbers as to cause the anglican clergymen there to lament that
"free thinking spreads almost as fast as the church." north carolina was
first settled toward the northern border by immigrants from virginia.
some of the north carolinians, particularly the quakers, came all the
way from new england, tarrying in virginia only long enough to learn how
little they were wanted in that anglican colony.

=the scotch-irish.=--next to the english in numbers and influence were
the scotch-irish, presbyterians in belief, english in tongue. both
religious and economic reasons sent them across the sea. their scotch
ancestors, in the days of cromwell, had settled in the north of ireland
whence the native irish had been driven by the conqueror's sword. there
the scotch nourished for many years enjoying in peace their own form of
religion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and
woolen cloth. then the blow fell. toward the end of the seventeenth
century their religious worship was put under the ban and the export of
their cloth was forbidden by the english parliament. within two decades
twenty thousand scotch-irish left ulster alone, for america; and all
during the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy.
although no exact record was kept, it is reckoned that the scotch-irish
and the scotch who came directly from scotland, composed one-sixth of
the entire american population on the eve of the revolution.

[illustration: settlements of german and scotch-irish
immigrants]

these newcomers in america made their homes chiefly in new jersey,
pennsylvania, maryland, virginia, and the carolinas. coming late upon
the scene, they found much of the land immediately upon the seaboard
already taken up. for this reason most of them became frontier people
settling the interior and upland regions. there they cleared the land,
laid out their small farms, and worked as "sturdy yeomen on the soil,"
hardy, industrious, and independent in spirit, sharing neither the
luxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely
merchants. to their agriculture they added woolen and linen
manufactures, which, flourishing in the supple fingers of their tireless
women, made heavy inroads upon the trade of the english merchants in
the colonies. of their labors a poet has sung:

        "o, willing hands to toil;
    strong natures tuned to the harvest-song and bound to the kindly soil;
    bold pioneers for the wilderness, defenders in the field."

=the germans.=--third among the colonists in order of numerical
importance were the germans. from the very beginning, they appeared in
colonial records. a number of the artisans and carpenters in the first
jamestown colony were of german descent. peter minuit, the famous
governor of new motherland, was a german from wesel on the rhine, and
jacob leisler, leader of a popular uprising against the provincial
administration of new york, was a german from frankfort-on-main. the
wholesale migration of germans began with the founding of pennsylvania.
penn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his
lands and he made a special effort to attract peasants from the rhine
country. a great association, known as the frankfort company, bought
more than twenty thousand acres from him and in 1684 established a
center at germantown for the distribution of german immigrants. in old
new york, rhinebeck-on-the-hudson became a similar center for
distribution. all the way from maine to georgia inducements were offered
to the german farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found, in
time, german settlements. in fact the migration became so large that
german princes were frightened at the loss of so many subjects and
england was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas
dominions. yet nothing could stop the movement. by the end of the
colonial period, the number of germans had risen to more than two
hundred thousand.

the majority of them were protestants from the rhine region, and south
germany. wars, religious controversies, oppression, and poverty drove
them forth to america. though most of them were farmers, there were also
among them skilled artisans who contributed to the rapid growth of
industries in pennsylvania. their iron, glass, paper, and woolen mills,
dotted here and there among the thickly settled regions, added to the
wealth and independence of the province.

unlike the scotch-irish, the germans did not speak the language of the
original colonists or mingle freely with them. they kept to themselves,
built their own schools, founded their own newspapers, and published
their own books. their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors
and led to occasional agitations against "foreigners." however, no
serious collisions seem to have occurred; and in the days of the
revolution, german soldiers from pennsylvania fought in the patriot
armies side by side with soldiers from the english and scotch-irish
sections.

=other nationalities.=--though the english, the scotch-irish, and the
germans made up the bulk of the colonial population, there were other
racial strains as well, varying in numerical importance but contributing
their share to colonial life.

from france came the huguenots fleeing from the decree of the king which
inflicted terrible penalties upon protestants.

from "old ireland" came thousands of native irish, celtic in race and
catholic in religion. like their scotch-irish neighbors to the north,
they revered neither the government nor the church of england imposed
upon them by the sword. how many came we do not know, but shipping
records of the colonial period show that boatload after boatload left
the southern and eastern shores of ireland for the new world.
undoubtedly thousands of their passengers were irish of the native
stock. this surmise is well sustained by the constant appearance of
celtic names in the records of various colonies.

the jews, then as ever engaged in their age-long battle for religious
and economic toleration, found in the american colonies, not complete
liberty, but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in england,
france, spain, or portugal. the english law did not actually recognize
their right to live in any of the dominions, but owing to the easy-going
habits of the americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard
towns. the treatment they received there varied. on one occasion the
mayor and council of new york forbade them to sell by retail and on
another prohibited the exercise of their religious worship. newport,
philadelphia, and charleston were more hospitable, and there large
jewish colonies, consisting principally of merchants and their families,
flourished in spite of nominal prohibitions of the law.

though the small swedish colony in delaware was quickly submerged
beneath the tide of english migration, the dutch in new york continued
to hold their own for more than a hundred years after the english
conquest in 1664. at the end of the colonial period over one-half of the
170,000 inhabitants of the province were descendants of the original
dutch--still distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and
manners of new york. many of them clung as tenaciously to their mother
tongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their dutch ovens;
but they were slowly losing their identity as the english pressed in
beside them to farm and trade.

the melting pot had begun its historic mission.


the process of colonization

considered from one side, colonization, whatever the motives of the
emigrants, was an economic matter. it involved the use of capital to pay
for their passage, to sustain them on the voyage, and to start them on
the way of production. under this stern economic necessity, puritans,
scotch-irish, germans, and all were alike laid.

=immigrants who paid their own way.=--many of the immigrants to america
in colonial days were capitalists themselves, in a small or a large way,
and paid their own passage. what proportion of the colonists were able
to finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture.
undoubtedly a very considerable number could do so, for we can trace the
family fortunes of many early settlers. henry cabot lodge is authority
for the statement that "the settlers of new england were drawn from the
country gentlemen, small farmers, and yeomanry of the mother
country.... many of the emigrants were men of wealth, as the old lists
show, and all of them, with few exceptions, were men of property and
good standing. they did not belong to the classes from which emigration
is usually supplied, for they all had a stake in the country they left
behind." though it would be interesting to know how accurate this
statement is or how applicable to the other colonies, no study has as
yet been made to gratify that interest. for the present it is an
unsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the
cost of their own transfer to the new world.

=indentured servants.=--that at least tens of thousands of immigrants
were unable to pay for their passage is established beyond the shadow of
a doubt by the shipping records that have come down to us. the great
barrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to america was the cost
of the sea voyage. to overcome this difficulty a plan was worked out
whereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage
money to immigrants in return for their promise, or bond, to work for a
term of years to repay the sum advanced. this system was called
indentured servitude.

it is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original
twenty thousand puritans, the yeomen, the virginia gentlemen, and the
huguenots combined. all the way down the coast from massachusetts to
georgia were to be found in the fields, kitchens, and workshops, men,
women, and children serving out terms of bondage generally ranging from
five to seven years. in the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond
servants was very high. the baltimores, penns, carterets, and other
promoters anxiously sought for workers of every nationality to till
their fields, for land without labor was worth no more than land in the
moon. hence the gates of the proprietary colonies were flung wide open.
every inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land,
and special efforts were made to increase the population by importing
servants. in pennsylvania, it was not uncommon to find a master with
fifty bond servants on his estate. it has been estimated that two-thirds
of all the immigrants into pennsylvania between the opening of the
eighteenth century and the outbreak of the revolution were in bondage.
in the other middle colonies the number was doubtless not so large; but
it formed a considerable part of the population.

the story of this traffic in white servants is one of the most striking
things in the history of labor. bondmen differed from the serfs of the
feudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master.
they likewise differed from the negro slaves in that their servitude had
a time limit. still they were subject to many special disabilities. it
was, for instance, a common practice to impose on them penalties far
heavier than were imposed upon freemen for the same offense. a free
citizen of pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was
let off with a fine; a white servant guilty of the same unlawful conduct
was whipped at the post and fined as well.

the ordinary life of the white servant was also severely restricted. a
bondman could not marry without his master's consent; nor engage in
trade; nor refuse work assigned to him. for an attempt to escape or
indeed for any infraction of the law, the term of service was extended.
the condition of white bondmen in virginia, according to lodge, "was
little better than that of slaves. loose indentures and harsh laws put
them at the mercy of their masters." it would not be unfair to add that
such was their lot in all other colonies. their fate depended upon the
temper of their masters.

cruel as was the system in many ways, it gave thousands of people in the
old world a chance to reach the new--an opportunity to wrestle with fate
for freedom and a home of their own. when their weary years of servitude
were over, if they survived, they might obtain land of their own or
settle as free mechanics in the towns. for many a bondman the gamble
proved to be a losing venture because he found himself unable to rise
out of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servitude
carried him. for thousands, on the contrary, bondage proved to be a real
avenue to freedom and prosperity. some of the best citizens of america
have the blood of indentured servants in their veins.

=the transported--involuntary servitude.=--in their anxiety to secure
settlers, the companies and proprietors having colonies in america
either resorted to or connived at the practice of kidnapping men, women,
and children from the streets of english cities. in 1680 it was
officially estimated that "ten thousand persons were spirited away" to
america. many of the victims of the practice were young children, for
the traffic in them was highly profitable. orphans and dependents were
sometimes disposed of in america by relatives unwilling to support them.
in a single year, 1627, about fifteen hundred children were shipped to
virginia.

in this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies, and very few
romances. parents were separated from their children and husbands from
their wives. hundreds of skilled artisans--carpenters, smiths, and
weavers--utterly disappeared as if swallowed up by death. a few thus
dragged off to the new world to be sold into servitude for a term of
five or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with
fortunes. in one case a young man who was forcibly carried over the sea
lived to make his way back to england and establish his claim to a
peerage.

akin to the kidnapped, at least in economic position, were convicts
deported to the colonies for life in lieu of fines and imprisonment. the
americans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice.
indeed, they exaggerated its evils, for many of the "criminals" were
only mild offenders against unduly harsh and cruel laws. a peasant
caught shooting a rabbit on a lord's estate or a luckless servant girl
who purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded as a criminal along with
sturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals. other transported offenders
were "political criminals"; that is, persons who criticized or opposed
the government. this class included now irish who revolted against
british rule in ireland; now cavaliers who championed the king against
the puritan revolutionists; puritans, in turn, dispatched after the
monarchy was restored; and scotch and english subjects in general who
joined in political uprisings against the king.

=the african slaves.=--rivaling in numbers, in the course of time, the
indentured servants and whites carried to america against their will
were the african negroes brought to america and sold into slavery. when
this form of bondage was first introduced into virginia in 1619, it was
looked upon as a temporary necessity to be discarded with the increase
of the white population. moreover it does not appear that those planters
who first bought negroes at the auction block intended to establish a
system of permanent bondage. only by a slow process did chattel slavery
take firm root and become recognized as the leading source of the labor
supply. in 1650, thirty years after the introduction of slavery, there
were only three hundred africans in virginia.

the great increase in later years was due in no small measure to the
inordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in old and in
new england. finding it relatively easy to secure negroes in africa,
they crowded the southern ports with their vessels. the english royal
african company sent to america annually between 1713 and 1743 from five
to ten thousand slaves. the ship owners of new england were not far
behind their english brethren in pushing this extraordinary traffic.

as the proportion of the negroes to the free white population steadily
rose, and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and slave traders,
the southern colonies grew alarmed. in 1710, virginia sought to curtail
the importation by placing a duty of $5 on each slave. this effort was
futile, for the royal governor promptly vetoed it. from time to time
similar bills were passed, only to meet with royal disapproval. south
carolina, in 1760, absolutely prohibited importation; but the measure
was killed by the british crown. as late as 1772, virginia, not daunted
by a century of rebuffs, sent to george iii a petition in this vein:
"the importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of africa
hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its
present encouragement, we have too much reason to fear, will endanger
the very existence of your majesty's american dominions.... deeply
impressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech your majesty to
remove all those restraints on your majesty's governors of this colony
which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very
pernicious a commerce."

all such protests were without avail. the negro population grew by leaps
and bounds, until on the eve of the revolution it amounted to more than
half a million. in five states--maryland, virginia, the two carolinas,
and georgia--the slaves nearly equalled or actually exceeded the whites
in number. in south carolina they formed almost two-thirds of the
population. even in the middle colonies of delaware and pennsylvania
about one-fifth of the inhabitants were from africa. to the north, the
proportion of slaves steadily diminished although chattel servitude was
on the same legal footing as in the south. in new york approximately one
in six and in new england one in fifty were negroes, including a few
freedmen.

the climate, the soil, the commerce, and the industry of the north were
all unfavorable to the growth of a servile population. still, slavery,
though sectional, was a part of the national system of economy. northern
ships carried slaves to the southern colonies and the produce of the
plantations to europe. "if the northern states will consult their
interest, they will not oppose the increase in slaves which will
increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers," said
john rutledge, of south carolina, in the convention which framed the
constitution of the united states. "what enriches a part enriches the
whole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest,"
responded oliver ellsworth, the distinguished spokesman of connecticut.

chapter ii

colonial agriculture, industry, and commerce

the land and the westward movement


=the significance of land tenure.=--the way in which land may be
acquired, held, divided among heirs, and bought and sold exercises a
deep influence on the life and culture of a people. the feudal and
aristocratic societies of europe were founded on a system of landlordism
which was characterized by two distinct features. in the first place,
the land was nearly all held in great estates, each owned by a single
proprietor. in the second place, every estate was kept intact under the
law of primogeniture, which at the death of a lord transferred all his
landed property to his eldest son. this prevented the subdivision of
estates and the growth of a large body of small farmers or freeholders
owning their own land. it made a form of tenantry or servitude
inevitable for the mass of those who labored on the land. it also
enabled the landlords to maintain themselves in power as a governing
class and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and
political control. if land tenure was so significant in europe, it was
equally important in the development of america, where practically all
the first immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their
livelihood from the soil.

=experiments in common tillage.=--in the new world, with its broad
extent of land awaiting the white man's plow, it was impossible to
introduce in its entirety and over the whole area the system of lords
and tenants that existed across the sea. so it happened that almost
every kind of experiment in land tenure, from communism to feudalism,
was tried. in the early days of the jamestown colony, the land, though
owned by the london company, was tilled in common by the settlers. no
man had a separate plot of his own. the motto of the community was:
"labor and share alike." all were supposed to work in the fields and
receive an equal share of the produce. at plymouth, the pilgrims
attempted a similar experiment, laying out the fields in common and
distributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among
the workers.

in both colonies the communistic experiments were failures. angry at the
lazy men in jamestown who idled their time away and yet expected regular
meals, captain john smith issued a manifesto: "everyone that gathereth
not every day as much as i do, the next day shall be set beyond the
river and forever banished from the fort and live there or starve." even
this terrible threat did not bring a change in production. not until
each man was given a plot of his own to till, not until each gathered
the fruits of his own labor, did the colony prosper. in plymouth, where
the communal experiment lasted for five years, the results were similar
to those in virginia, and the system was given up for one of separate
fields in which every person could "set corn for his own particular."
some other new england towns, refusing to profit by the experience of
their plymouth neighbor, also made excursions into common ownership and
labor, only to abandon the idea and go in for individual ownership of
the land. "by degrees it was seen that even the lord's people could not
carry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome
practice."

=feudal elements in the colonies--quit rents, manors, and
plantations.=--at the other end of the scale were the feudal elements of
land tenure found in the proprietary colonies, in the seaboard regions
of the south, and to some extent in new york. the proprietor was in fact
a powerful feudal lord, owning land granted to him by royal charter. he
could retain any part of it for his personal use or dispose of it all in
large or small lots. while he generally kept for himself an estate of
baronial proportions, it was impossible for him to manage directly any
considerable part of the land in his dominion. consequently he either
sold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on
condition that they make to him an annual payment in money, known as
"quit rent." in maryland, the proprietor sometimes collected as high as
$9000 (equal to about $500,000 to-day) in a single year from this
source. in pennsylvania, the quit rents brought a handsome annual
tribute into the exchequer of the penn family. in the royal provinces,
the king of england claimed all revenues collected in this form from the
land, a sum amounting to $19,000 at the time of the revolution. the quit
rent,--"really a feudal payment from freeholders,"--was thus a material
source of income for the crown as well as for the proprietors. wherever
it was laid, however, it proved to be a burden, a source of constant
irritation; and it became a formidable item in the long list of
grievances which led to the american revolution.

something still more like the feudal system of the old world appeared in
the numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the crown, the
companies, or the proprietors. in the colony of maryland alone there
were sixty manors of three thousand acres each, owned by wealthy men and
tilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of
tenure. in new york also there were many manors of wide extent, most of
which originated in the days of the dutch west india company, when
extensive concessions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over
settlers. the van rensselaer, the van cortlandt, and the livingston
manors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send a
representative to the provincial legislature. the tenants on the new
york manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old european
estates. they were bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind; they
ground their grain at his mill; and they were subject to his judicial
power because he held court and meted out justice, in some instances
extending to capital punishment.

the manors of new york or maryland were, however, of slight consequence
as compared with the vast plantations of the southern seaboard--huge
estates, far wider in expanse than many a european barony and tilled by
slaves more servile than any feudal tenants. it must not be forgotten
that this system of land tenure became the dominant feature of a large
section and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of
america.

[illustration: southern plantation mansion]

=the small freehold.=--in the upland regions of the south, however, and
throughout most of the north, the drift was against all forms of
servitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold; that is,
the small farm owned outright and tilled by the possessor and his
family. this was favored by natural circumstances and the spirit of the
immigrants. for one thing, the abundance of land and the scarcity of
labor made it impossible for the companies, the proprietors, or the
crown to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates. in
many sections, particularly in new england, the climate, the stony soil,
the hills, and the narrow valleys conspired to keep the farms within a
moderate compass. for another thing, the english, scotch-irish, and
german peasants, even if they had been tenants in the old world, did not
propose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the new. if they
could not get freeholds, they would not settle at all; thus they forced
proprietors and companies to bid for their enterprise by selling land in
small lots. so it happened that the freehold of modest proportions
became the cherished unit of american farmers. the people who tilled the
farms were drawn from every quarter of western europe; but the freehold
system gave a uniform cast to their economic and social life in america.

[illustration: _from an old print_

a new england farmhouse]

=social effects of land tenure.=--land tenure and the process of western
settlement thus developed two distinct types of people engaged in the
same pursuit--agriculture. they had a common tie in that they both
cultivated the soil and possessed the local interest and independence
which arise from that occupation. their methods and their culture,
however, differed widely.

the southern planter, on his broad acres tilled by slaves, resembled the
english landlord on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who
labored with his own hands in the fields and forests. he sold his rice
and tobacco in large amounts directly to english factors, who took his
entire crop in exchange for goods and cash. his fine clothes,
silverware, china, and cutlery he bought in english markets. loving the
ripe old culture of the mother country, he often sent his sons to oxford
or cambridge for their education. in short, he depended very largely for
his prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the
old world. he did not even need market towns in which to buy native
goods, for they were made on his own plantation by his own artisans who
were usually gifted slaves.

the economic condition of the small farmer was totally different. his
crops were not big enough to warrant direct connection with english
factors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisans. he needed
local markets, and they sprang up to meet the need. smiths, hatters,
weavers, wagon-makers, and potters at neighboring towns supplied him
with the rough products of their native skill. the finer goods, bought
by the rich planter in england, the small farmer ordinarily could not
buy. his wants were restricted to staples like tea and sugar, and
between him and the european market stood the merchant. his community
was therefore more self-sufficient than the seaboard line of great
plantations. it was more isolated, more provincial, more independent,
more american. the planter faced the old east. the farmer faced the new
west.

=the westward movement.=--yeoman and planter nevertheless were alike in
one respect. their land hunger was never appeased. each had the eye of
an expert for new and fertile soil; and so, north and south, as soon as
a foothold was secured on the atlantic coast, the current of migration
set in westward, creeping through forests, across rivers, and over
mountains. many of the later immigrants, in their search for cheap
lands, were compelled to go to the border; but in a large part the path
breakers to the west were native americans of the second and third
generations. explorers, fired by curiosity and the lure of the
mysterious unknown, and hunters, fur traders, and squatters, following
their own sweet wills, blazed the trail, opening paths and sending back
stories of the new regions they traversed. then came the regular
settlers with lawful titles to the lands they had purchased, sometimes
singly and sometimes in companies.

in massachusetts, the westward movement is recorded in the founding of
springfield in 1636 and great barrington in 1725. by the opening of the
eighteenth century the pioneers of connecticut had pushed north and west
until their outpost towns adjoined the hudson valley settlements. in new
york, the inland movement was directed by the hudson river to albany,
and from that old dutch center it radiated in every direction,
particularly westward through the mohawk valley. new jersey was early
filled to its borders, the beginnings of the present city of new
brunswick being made in 1681 and those of trenton in 1685. in
pennsylvania, as in new york, the waterways determined the main lines of
advance. pioneers, pushing up through the valley of the schuylkill,
spread over the fertile lands of berks and lancaster counties, laying
out reading in 1748. another current of migration was directed by the
susquehanna, and, in 1726, the first farmhouse was built on the bank
where harrisburg was later founded. along the southern tier of counties
a thin line of settlements stretched westward to pittsburgh, reaching
the upper waters of the ohio while the colony was still under the penn
family.

in the south the westward march was equally swift. the seaboard was
quickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the
cultivation of tobacco and rice. the piedmont plateau, lying back from
the coast all the way from maryland to georgia, was fed by two streams
of migration, one westward from the sea and the other southward from the
other colonies--germans from pennsylvania and scotch-irish furnishing
the main supply. "by 1770, tide-water virginia was full to overflowing
and the 'back country' of the blue ridge and the shenandoah was fully
occupied. even the mountain valleys ... were claimed by sturdy pioneers.
before the declaration of independence, the oncoming tide of
home-seekers had reached the crest of the alleghanies."

[illustration: distribution of population, 1790]

beyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured, harbingers of an
invasion that was about to break in upon kentucky and tennessee. as
early as 1769 that mighty nimrod, daniel boone, curious to hunt
buffaloes, of which he had heard weird reports, passed through the
cumberland gap and brought back news of a wonderful country awaiting the
plow. a hint was sufficient. singly, in pairs, and in groups, settlers
followed the trail he had blazed. a great land corporation, the
transylvania company, emulating the merchant adventurers of earlier
times, secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit
rents from lands sold to farmers. by the outbreak of the revolution
there were several hundred people in the kentucky region. like the older
colonists, they did not relish quit rents, and their opposition wrecked
the transylvania company. they even carried their protests into the
continental congress in 1776, for by that time they were our "embryo
fourteenth colony."


industrial and commercial development

though the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming, there was
a steady growth in industrial and commercial pursuits. most of the
staple industries of to-day, not omitting iron and textiles, have their
beginnings in colonial times. manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to
towns which enjoyed an importance all out of proportion to their
numbers. the great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard
originated in the days when the king of england was "lord of these
dominions."

[illustration: domestic industry: dipping tallow candles]

=textile manufacture as a domestic industry.=--colonial women, in
addition to sharing every hardship of pioneering, often the heavy labor
of the open field, developed in the course of time a national industry
which was almost exclusively their own. wool and flax were raised in
abundance in the north and south. "every farm house," says coman, the
economic historian, "was a workshop where the women spun and wove the
serges, kerseys, and linsey-woolseys which served for the common wear."
by the close of the seventeenth century, new england manufactured cloth
in sufficient quantities to export it to the southern colonies and to
the west indies. as the industry developed, mills were erected for the
more difficult process of dyeing, weaving, and fulling, but carding and
spinning continued to be done in the home. the dutch of new netherland,
the swedes of delaware, and the scotch-irish of the interior "were not
one whit behind their yankee neighbors."

the importance of this enterprise to british economic life can hardly be
overestimated. for many a century the english had employed their fine
woolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade, and the
government had come to look upon it as an object of special interest and
protection. when the colonies were established, both merchants and
statesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value;
but before long the americans, instead of buying cloth, especially of
the coarser varieties, were making it to sell. in the place of
customers, here were rivals. in the place of helpless reliance upon
english markets, here was the germ of economic independence.

if british merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of
trade, observant officers in the provinces would have conveyed the news
to them. even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal
governor of new york wrote of the industrious americans to his home
government: "the consequence will be that if they can clothe themselves
once, not only comfortably, but handsomely too, without the help of
england, they who already are not very fond of submitting to government
will soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured
in their breasts. this will not seem strange when you consider what sort
of people this country is inhabited by."

=the iron industry.=--almost equally widespread was the art of iron
working--one of the earliest and most picturesque of colonial
industries. lynn, massachusetts, had a forge and skilled artisans within
fifteen years after the founding of boston. the smelting of iron began
at new london and new haven about 1658; in litchfield county,
connecticut, a few years later; at great barrington, massachusetts, in
1731; and near by at lenox some thirty years after that. new jersey had
iron works at shrewsbury within ten years after the founding of the
colony in 1665. iron forges appeared in the valleys of the delaware and
the susquehanna early in the following century, and iron masters then
laid the foundations of fortunes in a region destined to become one of
the great iron centers of the world. virginia began iron working in the
year that saw the introduction of slavery. although the industry soon
lapsed, it was renewed and flourished in the eighteenth century.
governor spotswood was called the "tubal cain" of the old dominion
because he placed the industry on a firm foundation. indeed it seems
that every colony, except georgia, had its iron foundry. nails, wire,
metallic ware, chains, anchors, bar and pig iron were made in large
quantities; and great britain, by an act in 1750, encouraged the
colonists to export rough iron to the british islands.

=shipbuilding.=--of all the specialized industries in the colonies,
shipbuilding was the most important. the abundance of fir for masts, oak
for timbers and boards, pitch for tar and turpentine, and hemp for rope
made the way of the shipbuilder easy. early in the seventeenth century a
ship was built at new amsterdam, and by the middle of that century
shipyards were scattered along the new england coast at newburyport,
salem, new bedford, newport, providence, new london, and new haven.
yards at albany and poughkeepsie in new york built ships for the trade
of that colony with england and the indies. wilmington and philadelphia
soon entered the race and outdistanced new york, though unable to equal
the pace set by new england. while maryland, virginia, and south
carolina also built ships, southern interest was mainly confined to the
lucrative business of producing ship materials: fir, cedar, hemp, and
tar.

=fishing.=--the greatest single economic resource of new england outside
of agriculture was the fisheries. this industry, started by hardy
sailors from europe, long before the landing of the pilgrims, flourished
under the indomitable seamanship of the puritans, who labored with the
net and the harpoon in almost every quarter of the atlantic. "look,"
exclaimed edmund burke, in the house of commons, "at the manner in
which the people of new england have of late carried on the whale
fishery. whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and
behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of hudson's bay
and davis's straits, while we are looking for them beneath the arctic
circle, we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar
cold, that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen
serpent of the south.... nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging
to them than the accumulated winter of both poles. we know that, whilst
some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of
africa, others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along
the coast of brazil. no sea but what is vexed by their fisheries. no
climate that is not witness to their toils. neither the perseverance of
holland nor the activity of france nor the dexterous and firm sagacity
of english enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard
industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent
people."

the influence of the business was widespread. a large and lucrative
european trade was built upon it. the better quality of the fish caught
for food was sold in the markets of spain, portugal, and italy, or
exchanged for salt, lemons, and raisins for the american market. the
lower grades of fish were carried to the west indies for slave
consumption, and in part traded for sugar and molasses, which furnished
the raw materials for the thriving rum industry of new england. these
activities, in turn, stimulated shipbuilding, steadily enlarging the
demand for fishing and merchant craft of every kind and thus keeping the
shipwrights, calkers, rope makers, and other artisans of the seaport
towns rushed with work. they also increased trade with the mother
country for, out of the cash collected in the fish markets of europe and
the west indies, the colonists paid for english manufactures. so an
ever-widening circle of american enterprise centered around this single
industry, the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit.

=oceanic commerce and american merchants.=--all through the eighteenth
century, the commerce of the american colonies spread in every direction
until it rivaled in the number of people employed, the capital engaged,
and the profits gleaned, the commerce of european nations. a modern
historian has said: "the enterprising merchants of new england developed
a network of trade routes that covered well-nigh half the world." this
commerce, destined to be of such significance in the conflict with the
mother country, presented, broadly speaking, two aspects.

on the one side, it involved the export of raw materials and
agricultural produce. the southern colonies produced for shipping,
tobacco, rice, tar, pitch, and pine; the middle colonies, grain, flour,
furs, lumber, and salt pork; new england, fish, flour, rum, furs, shoes,
and small articles of manufacture. the variety of products was in fact
astounding. a sarcastic writer, while sneering at the idea of an
american union, once remarked of colonial trade: "what sort of dish will
you make? new england will throw in fish and onions. the middle states,
flax-seed and flour. maryland and virginia will add tobacco. north
carolina, pitch, tar, and turpentine. south carolina, rice and indigo,
and georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawdust. such an
absurd jumble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such
discordant materials as the thirteen british provinces."

on the other side, american commerce involved the import trade,
consisting principally of english and continental manufactures, tea, and
"india goods." sugar and molasses, brought from the west indies,
supplied the flourishing distilleries of massachusetts, rhode island,
and connecticut. the carriage of slaves from africa to the southern
colonies engaged hundreds of new england's sailors and thousands of
pounds of her capital.

the disposition of imported goods in the colonies, though in part
controlled by english factors located in america, employed also a large
and important body of american merchants like the willings and morrises
of philadelphia; the amorys, hancocks, and faneuils of boston; and the
livingstons and lows of new york. in their zeal and enterprise, they
were worthy rivals of their english competitors, so celebrated for
world-wide commercial operations. though fully aware of the advantages
they enjoyed in british markets and under the protection of the british
navy, the american merchants were high-spirited and mettlesome, ready to
contend with royal officers in order to shield american interests
against outside interference.

[illustration: the dutch west india warehouse in new amsterdam
(new york city)]

measured against the immense business of modern times, colonial commerce
seems perhaps trivial. that, however, is not the test of its
significance. it must be considered in relation to the growth of english
colonial trade in its entirety--a relation which can be shown by a few
startling figures. the whole export trade of england, including that to
the colonies, was, in 1704, $6,509,000. on the eve of the american
revolution, namely, in 1772, english exports to the american colonies
alone amounted to $6,024,000; in other words, almost as much as the
whole foreign business of england two generations before. at the first
date, colonial trade was but one-twelfth of the english export business;
at the second date, it was considerably more than one-third. in 1704,
pennsylvania bought in english markets goods to the value of $11,459; in
1772 the purchases of the same colony amounted to $507,909. in short,
pennsylvania imports increased fifty times within sixty-eight years,
amounting in 1772 to almost the entire export trade of england to the
colonies at the opening of the century. the american colonies were
indeed a great source of wealth to english merchants.

=intercolonial commerce.=--although the bad roads of colonial times made
overland transportation difficult and costly, the many rivers and
harbors along the coast favored a lively water-borne trade among the
colonies. the connecticut, hudson, delaware, and susquehanna rivers in
the north and the many smaller rivers in the south made it possible for
goods to be brought from, and carried to, the interior regions in little
sailing vessels with comparative ease. sloops laden with manufactures,
domestic and foreign, collected at some city like providence, new york,
or philadelphia, skirted the coasts, visited small ports, and sailed up
the navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange
the raw materials which they had gathered in from neighboring farms.
larger ships carried the grain, live stock, cloth, and hardware of new
england to the southern colonies, where they were traded for tobacco,
leather, tar, and ship timber. from the harbors along the connecticut
shores there were frequent sailings down through long island sound to
maryland, virginia, and the distant carolinas.

=growth of towns.=--in connection with this thriving trade and industry
there grew up along the coast a number of prosperous commercial centers
which were soon reckoned among the first commercial towns of the whole
british empire, comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such
ports as liverpool and bristol. the statistical records of that time are
mainly guesses; but we know that philadelphia stood first in size among
these towns. serving as the port of entry for pennsylvania, delaware,
and western jersey, it had drawn within its borders, just before the
revolution, about 25,000 inhabitants. boston was second in rank, with
somewhat more than 20,000 people. new york, the "commercial capital of
connecticut and old east jersey," was slightly smaller than boston, but
growing at a steady rate. the fourth town in size was charleston, south
carolina, with about 10,000 inhabitants. newport in rhode island, a
center of rum manufacture and shipping, stood fifth, with a population
of about 7000. baltimore and norfolk were counted as "considerable
towns." in the interior, hartford in connecticut, lancaster and york in
pennsylvania, and albany in new york, with growing populations and
increasing trade, gave prophecy of an urban america away from the
seaboard. the other towns were straggling villages. williamsburg,
virginia, for example, had about two hundred houses, in which dwelt a
dozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen. inland county
seats often consisted of nothing more than a log courthouse, a prison,
and one wretched inn to house judges, lawyers, and litigants during the
sessions of the court.

the leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of
proportion to their population. they were the centers of wealth, for one
thing; of the press and political activity, for another. merchants and
artisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising
from their commercial operations. the towns were also centers for news,
gossip, religious controversy, and political discussion. in the market
places the farmers from the countryside learned of british policies and
laws, and so, mingling with the townsmen, were drawn into the main
currents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and
independence.

chapter iii

social and political progress


colonial life, crowded as it was with hard and unremitting toil, left
scant leisure for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. there was
little money in private purses or public treasuries to be dedicated to
schools, libraries, and museums. few there were with time to read long
and widely, and fewer still who could devote their lives to things that
delight the eye and the mind. and yet, poor and meager as the
intellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison, heroic
efforts were made in every community to lift the people above the plane
of mere existence. after the first clearings were opened in the forests
those efforts were redoubled, and with lengthening years told upon the
thought and spirit of the land. the appearance, during the struggle with
england, of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history,
political philosophy, and the arts of war, government, and diplomacy
itself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the american
intellect. no one, not even the most critical, can run through the
writings of distinguished americans scattered from massachusetts to
georgia--the adamses, ellsworth, the morrises, the livingstons,
hamilton, franklin, washington, madison, marshall, henry, the randolphs,
and the pinckneys--without coming to the conclusion that there was
something in american colonial life which fostered minds of depth and
power. women surmounted even greater difficulties than the men in the
process of self-education, and their keen interest in public issues is
evident in many a record like the _letters_ of mrs. john adams to her
husband during the revolution; the writings of mrs. mercy otis warren,
the sister of james otis, who measured her pen with the british
propagandists; and the patriot newspapers founded and managed by women.


the leadership of the churches

in the intellectual life of america, the churches assumed a role of high
importance. there were abundant reasons for this. in many of the
colonies--maryland, pennsylvania, and new england--the religious impulse
had been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration. in all
the colonies, the clergy, at least in the beginning, formed the only
class with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit. they preached
on sundays and taught school on week days. they led in the discussion of
local problems and in the formation of political opinion, so much of
which was concerned with the relation between church and state. they
wrote books and pamphlets. they filled most of the chairs in the
colleges; under clerical guidance, intellectual and spiritual, the
americans received their formal education. in several of the provinces
the anglican church was established by law. in new england the puritans
were supreme, notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their
authority. in the middle colonies, particularly, the multiplication of
sects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible; and in
all of them there was a growing diversity of faith, which promised in
time a separation of church and state and freedom of opinion.

=the church of england.=--virginia was the stronghold of the english
system of church and state. the anglican faith and worship were
prescribed by law, sustained by taxes imposed on all, and favored by the
governor, the provincial councilors, and the richest planters. "the
established church," says lodge, "was one of the appendages of the
virginia aristocracy. they controlled the vestries and the ministers,
and the parish church stood not infrequently on the estate of the
planter who built and managed it." as in england, catholics and
protestant dissenters were at first laid under heavy disabilities. only
slowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province; but when
once they were even covertly tolerated, they pressed steadily in, until,
by the revolution, they outnumbered the adherents of the established
order.

the church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the
carolinas after 1704, and in georgia after that colony passed directly
under the crown in 1754--this in spite of the fact that the majority of
the inhabitants were dissenters. against the protests of the catholics
it was likewise established in maryland. in new york, too,
notwithstanding the resistance of the dutch, the established church was
fostered by the provincial officials, and the anglicans, embracing about
one-fifteenth of the population, exerted an influence all out of
proportion to their numbers.

many factors helped to enhance the power of the english church in the
colonies. it was supported by the british government and the official
class sent out to the provinces. its bishops and archbishops in england
were appointed by the king, and its faith and service were set forth by
acts of parliament. having its seat of power in the english monarchy, it
could hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so
counteract to some extent the independent spirit that was growing up in
america. the church, always a strong bulwark of the state, therefore had
a political role to play here as in england. able bishops and far-seeing
leaders firmly grasped this fact about the middle of the eighteenth
century and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the
church in provincial affairs. unhappily for their plans they failed to
calculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dissenting
protestants, who still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts
in the mother country.

=puritanism in new england.=--if the established faith made for imperial
unity, the same could not be said of puritanism. the plymouth pilgrims
had cast off all allegiance to the anglican church and established a
separate and independent congregation before they came to america. the
puritans, essaying at first the task of reformers within the church,
soon after their arrival in massachusetts, likewise flung off their yoke
of union with the anglicans. in each town a separate congregation was
organized, the male members choosing the pastor, the teachers, and the
other officers. they also composed the voters in the town meeting, where
secular matters were determined. the union of church and government was
thus complete, and uniformity of faith and life prescribed by law and
enforced by civil authorities; but this worked for local autonomy
instead of imperial unity.

the clergy became a powerful class, dominant through their learning and
their fearful denunciations of the faithless. they wrote the books for
the people to read--the famous cotton mather having three hundred and
eighty-three books and pamphlets to his credit. in cooperation with the
civil officers they enforced a strict observance of the puritan
sabbath--a day of rest that began at six o'clock on saturday evening and
lasted until sunset on sunday. all work, all trading, all amusement, and
all worldly conversation were absolutely prohibited during those hours.
a thoughtless maid servant who for some earthly reason smiled in church
was in danger of being banished as a vagabond. robert pike, a devout
puritan, thinking the sun had gone to rest, ventured forth on horseback
one sunday evening and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike
him through a rift in the clouds. the next day he was brought into court
and fined for "his ungodly conduct." with persons accused of witchcraft
the puritans were still more ruthless. when a mania of persecution swept
over massachusetts in 1692, eighteen people were hanged, one was pressed
to death, many suffered imprisonment, and two died in jail.

just about this time, however, there came a break in the uniformity of
puritan rule. the crown and church in england had long looked upon it
with disfavor, and in 1684 king charles ii annulled the old charter of
the massachusetts bay company. a new document issued seven years later
wrested from the puritans of the colony the right to elect their own
governor and reserved the power of appointment to the king. it also
abolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members, substituting
for it a simple property qualification. thus a royal governor and an
official family, certain to be episcopalian in faith and monarchist in
sympathies, were forced upon massachusetts; and members of all religious
denominations, if they had the required amount of property, were
permitted to take part in elections. by this act in the name of the
crown, the puritan monopoly was broken down in massachusetts, and that
province was brought into line with connecticut, rhode island, and new
hampshire, where property, not religious faith, was the test for the
suffrage.

=growth of religious toleration.=--though neither the anglicans of
virginia nor the puritans of massachusetts believed in toleration for
other denominations, that principle was strictly applied in rhode
island. there, under the leadership of roger williams, liberty in
matters of conscience was established in the beginning. maryland, by
granting in 1649 freedom to those who professed to believe in jesus
christ, opened its gates to all christians; and pennsylvania, true to
the tenets of the friends, gave freedom of conscience to those "who
confess and acknowledge the one almighty and eternal god to be the
creator, upholder, and ruler of the world." by one circumstance or
another, the middle colonies were thus early characterized by diversity
rather than uniformity of opinion. dutch protestants, huguenots,
quakers, baptists, presbyterians, new lights, moravians, lutherans,
catholics, and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and
too widely scattered to permit any one of them to rule, if it had
desired to do so. there were communities and indeed whole sections where
one or another church prevailed, but in no colony was a legislature
steadily controlled by a single group. toleration encouraged diversity,
and diversity, in turn, worked for greater toleration.

the government and faith of the dissenting denominations conspired with
economic and political tendencies to draw america away from the english
state. presbyterians, quakers, baptists, and puritans had no hierarchy
of bishops and archbishops to bind them to the seat of power in london.
neither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting
articles of faith. local self-government in matters ecclesiastical
helped to train them for local self-government in matters political. the
spirit of independence which led dissenters to revolt in the old world,
nourished as it was amid favorable circumstances in the new world, made
them all the more zealous in the defense of every right against
authority imposed from without.


schools and colleges

=religion and local schools.=--one of the first cares of each protestant
denomination was the education of the children in the faith. in this
work the bible became the center of interest. the english version was
indeed the one book of the people. farmers, shopkeepers, and artisans,
whose life had once been bounded by the daily routine of labor, found in
the scriptures not only an inspiration to religious conduct, but also a
book of romance, travel, and history. "legend and annal," says john
richard green, "war-song and psalm, state-roll and biography, the mighty
voices of prophets, the parables of evangelists, stories of mission
journeys, of perils by sea and among the heathen, philosophic arguments,
apocalyptic visions, all were flung broadcast over minds unoccupied for
the most part by any rival learning.... as a mere literary monument, the
english version of the bible remains the noblest example of the english
tongue." it was the king james version just from the press that the
pilgrims brought across the sea with them.

for the authority of the established church was substituted the
authority of the scriptures. the puritans devised a catechism based upon
their interpretation of the bible, and, very soon after their arrival in
america, they ordered all parents and masters of servants to be diligent
in seeing that their children and wards were taught to read religious
works and give answers to the religious questions. massachusetts was
scarcely twenty years old before education of this character was
declared to be compulsory, and provision was made for public schools
where those not taught at home could receive instruction in reading and
writing.

[illustration: a page from a famous schoolbook

outside of new england the idea of compulsory education was not regarded
with the same favor; but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with
little schools kept by "dames, itinerant teachers, or local parsons."
whether we turn to the life of franklin in the north or washington in
the south, we read of tiny schoolhouses, where boys, and sometimes
girls, were taught to read and write. where there were no schools,
fathers and mothers of the better kind gave their children the rudiments
of learning. though illiteracy was widespread, there is evidence to show
that the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady
progress all through the eighteenth century.

=religion and higher learning.=--religious motives entered into the
establishment of colleges as well as local schools. harvard, founded in
1636, and yale, opened in 1718, were intended primarily to train
"learned and godly ministers" for the puritan churches of new england.
to the far north, dartmouth, chartered in 1769, was designed first as a
mission to the indians and then as a college for the sons of new england
farmers preparing to preach, teach, or practice law. the college of new
jersey, organized in 1746 and removed to princeton eleven years later,
was sustained by the presbyterians. two colleges looked to the
established church as their source of inspiration and support: william
and mary, founded in virginia in 1693, and king's college, now columbia
university, chartered by king george ii in 1754, on an appeal from the
new york anglicans, alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the
"republican tendencies" of the age. two colleges revealed a drift away
from sectarianism. brown, established in rhode island in 1764, and the
philadelphia academy, forerunner of the university of pennsylvania,
organized by benjamin franklin, reflected the spirit of toleration by
giving representation on the board of trustees to several religious
sects. it was franklin's idea that his college should prepare young men
to serve in public office as leaders of the people and ornaments to
their country.

=self-education in america.=--important as were these institutions of
learning, higher education was by no means confined within their walls.
many well-to-do families sent their sons to oxford or cambridge in
england. private tutoring in the home was common. in still more families
there were intelligent children who grew up in the great colonial school
of adversity and who trained themselves until, in every contest of mind
and wit, they could vie with the sons of harvard or william and mary or
any other college. such, for example, was benjamin franklin, whose
charming autobiography, in addition to being an american classic, is a
fine record of self-education. his formal training in the classroom was
limited to a few years at a local school in boston; but his
self-education continued throughout his life. he early manifested a zeal
for reading, and devoured, he tells us, his father's dry library on
theology, bunyan's works, defoe's writings, plutarch's _lives_, locke's
_on the human understanding_, and innumerable volumes dealing with
secular subjects. his literary style, perhaps the best of his time,
franklin acquired by the diligent and repeated analysis of the
_spectator_. in a life crowded with labors, he found time to read widely
in natural science and to win single-handed recognition at the hands of
european savants for his discoveries in electricity. by his own efforts
he "attained an acquaintance" with latin, italian, french, and spanish,
thus unconsciously preparing himself for the day when he was to speak
for all america at the court of the king of france.

lesser lights than franklin, educated by the same process, were found
all over colonial america. from this fruitful source of native ability,
self-educated, the american cause drew great strength in the trials of
the revolution.


the colonial press

=the rise of the newspaper.=--the evolution of american democracy into a
government by public opinion, enlightened by the open discussion of
political questions, was in no small measure aided by a free press. that
too, like education, was a matter of slow growth. a printing press was
brought to massachusetts in 1639, but it was put in charge of an
official censor and limited to the publication of religious works. forty
years elapsed before the first newspaper appeared, bearing the curious
title, _public occurrences both foreign and domestic_, and it had not
been running very long before the government of massachusetts suppressed
it for discussing a political question.

publishing, indeed, seemed to be a precarious business; but in 1704
there came a second venture in journalism, _the boston news-letter_,
which proved to be a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from
criticizing the authorities. still the public interest languished. when
franklin's brother, james, began to issue his _new england courant_
about 1720, his friends sought to dissuade him, saying that one
newspaper was enough for america. nevertheless he continued it; and his
confidence in the future was rewarded. in nearly every colony a gazette
or chronicle appeared within the next thirty years or more. benjamin
franklin was able to record in 1771 that america had twenty-five
newspapers. boston led with five. philadelphia had three: two in english
and one in german.

=censorship and restraints on the press.=--the idea of printing,
unlicensed by the government and uncontrolled by the church, was,
however, slow in taking form. the founders of the american colonies had
never known what it was to have the free and open publication of books,
pamphlets, broadsides, and newspapers. when the art of printing was
first discovered, the control of publishing was vested in clerical
authorities. after the establishment of the state church in england in
the reign of elizabeth, censorship of the press became a part of royal
prerogative. printing was restricted to oxford, cambridge, and london;
and no one could publish anything without previous approval of the
official censor. when the puritans were in power, the popular party,
with a zeal which rivaled that of the crown, sought, in turn, to silence
royalist and clerical writers by a vigorous censorship. after the
restoration of the monarchy, control of the press was once more placed
in royal hands, where it remained until 1695, when parliament, by
failing to renew the licensing act, did away entirely with the official

censorship. by that time political parties were so powerful and so
active and printing presses were so numerous that official review of all
published matter became a sheer impossibility.

in america, likewise, some troublesome questions arose in connection
with freedom of the press. the puritans of massachusetts were no less
anxious than king charles or the archbishop of london to shut out from
the prying eyes of the people all literature "not mete for them to
read"; and so they established a system of official licensing for
presses, which lasted until 1755. in the other colonies where there was
more diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with
impunity, they were nevertheless constantly liable to arrest for
printing anything displeasing to the colonial governments. in 1721 the
editor of the _mercury_ in philadelphia was called before the
proprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political article,
and for a later offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail.
a still more famous case was that of peter zenger, a new york publisher,
who was arrested in 1735 for criticising the administration. lawyers who
ventured to defend the unlucky editor were deprived of their licenses to
practice, and it became necessary to bring an attorney all the way from
philadelphia. by this time the tension of feeling was high, and the
approbation of the public was forthcoming when the lawyer for the
defense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself, not
that of the poor printer, was on trial! the verdict for zenger, when it
finally came, was the signal for an outburst of popular rejoicing.
already the people of king george's province knew how precious a thing
is the freedom of the press.

thanks to the schools, few and scattered as they were, and to the
vigilance of parents, a very large portion, perhaps nearly one-half, of
the colonists could read. through the newspapers, pamphlets, and
almanacs that streamed from the types, the people could follow the
course of public events and grasp the significance of political
arguments. an american opinion was in the process of making--an
independent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions
around the fireside and at the taverns. when the day of resistance to
british rule came, government by opinion was at hand. for every person
who could hear the voice of patrick henry and samuel adams, there were a
thousand who could see their appeals on the printed page. men who had
spelled out their letters while poring over franklin's _poor richard's
almanac_ lived to read thomas paine's thrilling call to arms.


the evolution in political institutions

two very distinct lines of development appeared in colonial politics.
the one, exalting royal rights and aristocratic privileges, was the
drift toward provincial government through royal officers appointed in
england. the other, leading toward democracy and self-government, was
the growth in the power of the popular legislative assembly. each
movement gave impetus to the other, with increasing force during the
passing years, until at last the final collision between the two ideals
of government came in the war of independence.

=the royal provinces.=--of the thirteen english colonies eight were
royal provinces in 1776, with governors appointed by the king. virginia
passed under the direct rule of the crown in 1624, when the charter of
the london company was annulled. the massachusetts bay corporation lost
its charter in 1684, and the new instrument granted seven years later
stripped the colonists of the right to choose their chief executive. in
the early decades of the eighteenth century both the carolinas were
given the provincial instead of the proprietary form. new hampshire,
severed from massachusetts in 1679, and georgia, surrendered by the
trustees in 1752, went into the hands of the crown. new york,
transferred to the duke of york on its capture from the dutch in 1664,
became a province when he took the title of james ii in 1685. new
jersey, after remaining for nearly forty years under proprietors, was
brought directly under the king in 1702. maryland, pennsylvania, and
delaware, although they retained their proprietary character until the
revolution, were in some respects like the royal colonies, for their
governors were as independent of popular choice as were the appointees
of king george. only two colonies, rhode island and connecticut,
retained full self-government on the eve of the revolution. they alone
had governors and legislatures entirely of their own choosing.

the chief officer of the royal province was the governor, who enjoyed
high and important powers which he naturally sought to augment at every
turn. he enforced the laws and, usually with the consent of a council,
appointed the civil and military officers. he granted pardons and
reprieves; he was head of the highest court; he was commander-in-chief
of the militia; he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in
time of invasion, war, and rebellion. in all the provinces, except
massachusetts, he named the councilors who composed the upper house of
the legislature and was likely to choose those who favored his claims.
he summoned, adjourned, and dissolved the popular assembly, or the lower
house; he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown; and
he vetoed measures which he thought objectionable. here were in america
all the elements of royal prerogative against which hampden had
protested and cromwell had battled in england.

[illustration: the royal governor's palace at new berne]

the colonial governors were generally surrounded by a body of
office-seekers and hunters for land grants. some of them were noblemen
of broken estates who had come to america to improve their fortunes. the
pretensions of this circle grated on colonial nerves, and privileges
granted to them, often at the expense of colonists, did much to deepen
popular antipathy to the british government. favors extended to
adherents of the established church displeased dissenters. the
reappearance of this formidable union of church and state, from which
they had fled, stirred anew the ancient wrath against that combination.

=the colonial assembly.=--coincident with the drift toward
administration through royal governors was the second and opposite
tendency, namely, a steady growth in the practice of self-government.
the voters of england had long been accustomed to share in taxation and
law-making through representatives in parliament, and the idea was early
introduced in america. virginia was only twelve years old (1619) when
its first representative assembly appeared. as the towns of
massachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of
the corporation to meet at one place, the representative idea was
adopted, in 1633. the river towns of connecticut formed a representative
system under their "fundamental orders" of 1639, and the entire colony
was given a royal charter in 1662. generosity, as well as practical
considerations, induced such proprietors as lord baltimore and william
penn to invite their colonists to share in the government as soon as any
considerable settlements were made. thus by one process or another every
one of the colonies secured a popular assembly.

it is true that in the provision for popular elections, the suffrage was
finally restricted to property owners or taxpayers, with a leaning
toward the freehold qualification. in virginia, the rural voter had to
be a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land, if there was no
house on it, or twenty-five acres with a house twenty-five feet square.
in massachusetts, the voter for member of the assembly under the charter
of 1691 had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year
at least or of other property to the value of forty pounds sterling. in
pennsylvania, the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty acres
or more of land well seated, twelve acres cleared, and to other persons
worth at least fifty pounds in lawful money.

restrictions like these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very
considerable number of men, particularly the mechanics and artisans of
the towns, who were by no means content with their position.
nevertheless, it was relatively easy for any man to acquire a small
freehold, so cheap and abundant was land; and in fact a large proportion
of the colonists were land owners. thus the assemblies, in spite of the
limited suffrage, acquired a democratic tone.

the popular character of the assemblies increased as they became engaged
in battles with the royal and proprietary governors. when called upon by
the executive to make provision for the support of the administration,
the legislature took advantage of the opportunity to make terms in the
interest of the taxpayers. it made annual, not permanent, grants of
money to pay official salaries and then insisted upon electing a
treasurer to dole it out. thus the colonists learned some of the
mysteries of public finance, as well as the management of rapacious
officials. the legislature also used its power over money grants to
force the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed.

=contests between legislatures and governors.=--as may be imagined, many
and bitter were the contests between the royal and proprietary governors
and the colonial assemblies. franklin relates an amusing story of how
the pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bill for the executive to
sign and, in the other hand, the money to pay his salary. then, with sly
humor, franklin adds: "do not, my courteous reader, take pet at our
proprietary constitution for these our bargain and sale proceedings in
legislation. it is a happy country where justice and what was your own
before can be had for ready money. it is another addition to the value
of money and of course another spur to industry. every land is not so
blessed."

it must not be thought, however, that every governor got off as easily
as franklin's tale implies. on the contrary, the legislatures, like
caesar, fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon
executive prerogatives as they tried out and found their strength. if
we may believe contemporary laments, the power of the crown in america
was diminishing when it was struck down altogether. in new york, the
friends of the governor complained in 1747 that "the inhabitants of
plantations are generally educated in republican principles; upon
republican principles all is conducted. little more than a shadow of
royal authority remains in the northern colonies." "here," echoed the
governor of south carolina, the following year, "levelling principles
prevail; the frame of the civil government is unhinged; a governor, if
he would be idolized, must betray his trust; the people have got their
whole administration in their hands; the election of the members of the
assembly is by ballot; not civil posts only, but all ecclesiastical
preferments, are in the disposal or election of the people."

though baffled by the "levelling principles" of the colonial assemblies,
the governors did not give up the case as hopeless. instead they evolved
a system of policy and action which they thought could bring the
obstinate provincials to terms. that system, traceable in their letters
to the government in london, consisted of three parts: (1) the royal
officers in the colonies were to be made independent of the legislatures
by taxes imposed by acts of parliament; (2) a british standing army was
to be maintained in america; (3) the remaining colonial charters were to
be revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be enlarged.

such a system seemed plausible enough to king george iii and to many
ministers of the crown in london. with governors, courts, and an army
independent of the colonists, they imagined it would be easy to carry
out both royal orders and acts of parliament. this reasoning seemed both
practical and logical. nor was it founded on theory, for it came fresh
from the governors themselves. it was wanting in one respect only. it
failed to take account of the fact that the american people were growing
strong in the practice of self-government and could dispense with the
tutelage of the british ministry, no matter how excellent it might be or
how benevolent its intentions.

chapter iv

the development of colonial nationalism


it is one of the well-known facts of history that a people loosely
united by domestic ties of a political and economic nature, even a
people torn by domestic strife, may be welded into a solid and compact
body by an attack from a foreign power. the imperative call to common
defense, the habit of sharing common burdens, the fusing force of common
service--these things, induced by the necessity of resisting outside
interference, act as an amalgam drawing together all elements, except,
perhaps, the most discordant. the presence of the enemy allays the most
virulent of quarrels, temporarily at least. "politics," runs an old
saying, "stops at the water's edge."

this ancient political principle, so well understood in diplomatic
circles, applied nearly as well to the original thirteen american
colonies as to the countries of europe. the necessity for common
defense, if not equally great, was certainly always pressing. though it
has long been the practice to speak of the early settlements as founded
in "a wilderness," this was not actually the case. from the earliest
days of jamestown on through the years, the american people were
confronted by dangers from without. all about their tiny settlements
were indians, growing more and more hostile as the frontier advanced and
as sharp conflicts over land aroused angry passions. to the south and
west was the power of spain, humiliated, it is true, by the disaster to
the armada, but still presenting an imposing front to the british
empire. to the north and west were the french, ambitious, energetic,
imperial in temper, and prepared to contest on land and water the
advance of british dominion in america.


relations with the indians and the french

=indian affairs.=--it is difficult to make general statements about the
relations of the colonists to the indians. the problem was presented in
different shape in different sections of america. it was not handled
according to any coherent or uniform plan by the british government,
which alone could speak for all the provinces at the same time. neither
did the proprietors and the governors who succeeded one another, in an
irregular train, have the consistent policy or the matured experience
necessary for dealing wisely with indian matters. as the difficulties
arose mainly on the frontiers, where the restless and pushing pioneers
were making their way with gun and ax, nearly everything that happened
was the result of chance rather than of calculation. a personal quarrel
between traders and an indian, a jug of whisky, a keg of gunpowder, the
exchange of guns for furs, personal treachery, or a flash of bad temper
often set in motion destructive forces of the most terrible character.

on one side of the ledger may be set innumerable generous records--of
squanto and samoset teaching the pilgrims the ways of the wilds; of
roger williams buying his lands from the friendly natives; or of william
penn treating with them on his arrival in america. on the other side of
the ledger must be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as the
frontier rolled westward with deadly precision. the pequots on the
connecticut border, sensing their doom, fell upon the tiny settlements
with awful fury in 1637 only to meet with equally terrible punishment. a
generation later, king philip, son of massasoit, the friend of the
pilgrims, called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought
the strength of all new england to the field and ended in his own
destruction. in new york, the relations with the indians, especially
with the algonquins and the mohawks, were marked by periodic and
desperate wars. virginia and her southern neighbors suffered as did new
england. in 1622 opecacano, a brother of powhatan, the friend of the
jamestown settlers, launched a general massacre; and in 1644 he
attempted a war of extermination. in 1675 the whole frontier was ablaze.
nathaniel bacon vainly attempted to stir the colonial governor to put up
an adequate defense and, failing in that plea, himself headed a revolt
and a successful expedition against the indians. as the virginia
outposts advanced into the kentucky country, the strife with the natives
was transferred to that "dark and bloody ground"; while to the
southeast, a desperate struggle with the tuscaroras called forth the
combined forces of the two carolinas and virginia.

virginians defending themselves against the indians]

from such horrors new jersey and delaware were saved on account of their
geographical location. pennsylvania, consistently following a policy of
conciliation, was likewise spared until her western vanguard came into
full conflict with the allied french and indians. georgia, by clever
negotiations and treaties of alliance, managed to keep on fair terms
with her belligerent cherokees and creeks. but neither diplomacy nor
generosity could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier advanced,
especially after the french soldiers enlisted the indians in their
imperial enterprises. it was then that desultory fighting became general
warfare.

[illustration: english, french, and spanish possessions in america,
1750]

=early relations with the french.=--during the first decades of french
exploration and settlement in the st. lawrence country, the english
colonies, engrossed with their own problems, gave little or no thought
to their distant neighbors. quebec, founded in 1608, and montreal, in
1642, were too far away, too small in population, and too slight in
strength to be much of a menace to boston, hartford, or new york. it was
the statesmen in france and england, rather than the colonists in
america, who first grasped the significance of the slowly converging
empires in north america. it was the ambition of louis xiv of france,
rather than the labors of jesuit missionaries and french rangers, that
sounded the first note of colonial alarm.

evidence of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the
english and the french occurred before their advancing frontiers met on
the pennsylvania border. king william's war (1689-1697), queen anne's
war (1701-1713), and king george's war (1744-1748) owed their origins
and their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries of european
powers, although they all involved the american colonies in struggles
with the french and their savage allies.

=the clash in the ohio valley.=--the second of these wars had hardly
closed, however, before the english colonists themselves began to be
seriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding french dominion in the
west. marquette and joliet, who opened the lake region, and la salle,
who in 1682 had gone down the mississippi to the gulf, had been followed
by the builders of forts. in 1718, the french founded new orleans, thus
taking possession of the gateway to the mississippi as well as the st.
lawrence. a few years later they built fort niagara; in 1731 they
occupied crown point; in 1749 they formally announced their dominion
over all the territory drained by the ohio river. having asserted this
lofty claim, they set out to make it good by constructing in the years
1752-1754 fort le boeuf near lake erie, fort venango on the upper
waters of the allegheny, and fort duquesne at the junction of the
streams forming the ohio. though they were warned by george washington,
in the name of the governor of virginia, to keep out of territory "so
notoriously known to be property of the crown of great britain," the
french showed no signs of relinquishing their pretensions.

[illustration: _from an old print_

braddock's retreat]

=the final phase--the french and indian war.=--thus it happened that the
shot which opened the seven years' war, known in america as the french
and indian war, was fired in the wilds of pennsylvania. there began the
conflict that spread to europe and even asia and finally involved
england and prussia, on the one side, and france, austria, spain, and
minor powers on the other. on american soil, the defeat of braddock in
1755 and wolfe's exploit in capturing quebec four years later were the
dramatic features. on the continent of europe, england subsidized
prussian arms to hold france at bay. in india, on the banks of the
ganges, as on the banks of the st. lawrence, british arms were
triumphant. well could the historian write: "conquests equaling in
rapidity and far surpassing in magnitude those of cortes and pizarro had
been achieved in the east." well could the merchants of london declare
that under the administration of william pitt, the imperial genius of
this world-wide conflict, commerce had been "united with and made to
flourish by war."

from the point of view of the british empire, the results of the war
were momentous. by the peace of 1763, canada and the territory east of
the mississippi, except new orleans, passed under the british flag. the
remainder of the louisiana territory was transferred to spain and french
imperial ambitions on the american continent were laid to rest. in
exchange for havana, which the british had seized during the war, spain
ceded to king george the colony of florida. not without warrant did
macaulay write in after years that pitt "was the first englishman of his
time; and he had made england the first country in the world."


the effects of warfare on the colonies

the various wars with the french and the indians, trivial in detail as
they seem to-day, had a profound influence on colonial life and on the
destiny of america. circumstances beyond the control of popular
assemblies, jealous of their individual powers, compelled cooperation
among them, grudging and stingy no doubt, but still cooperation. the
american people, more eager to be busy in their fields or at their
trades, were simply forced to raise and support armies, to learn the
arts of warfare, and to practice, if in a small theater, the science of
statecraft. these forces, all cumulative, drove the colonists, so
tenaciously provincial in their habits, in the direction of nationalism.

=the new england confederation.=--it was in their efforts to deal with
the problems presented by the indian and french menace that the
americans took the first steps toward union. though there were many
common ties among the settlers of new england, it required a deadly
fear of the indians to produce in 1643 the new england confederation,
composed of massachusetts, plymouth, connecticut, and new haven. the
colonies so united were bound together in "a firm and perpetual league
of friendship and amity for offense and defense, mutual service and
succor, upon all just occasions." they made provision for distributing
the burdens of wars among the members and provided for a congress of
commissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies. for
some twenty years the confederation was active and it continued to hold
meetings until after the extinction of the indian peril on the immediate
border.

virginia, no less than massachusetts, was aware of the importance of
intercolonial cooperation. in the middle of the seventeenth century, the
old dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with new york and the
colonies of new england. in 1684 delegates from virginia met at albany
with the agents of new york and massachusetts to discuss problems of
mutual defense. a few years later the old dominion cooperated loyally
with the carolinas in defending their borders against indian forays.

=the albany plan of union.=--an attempt at a general colonial union was
made in 1754. on the suggestion of the lords of trade in england, a
conference was held at albany to consider indian relations, to devise
measures of defense against the french, and to enter into "articles of
union and confederation for the general defense of his majesty's
subjects and interests in north america as well in time of peace as of
war." new hampshire, massachusetts, connecticut, rhode island, new york,
pennsylvania, and maryland were represented. after a long discussion, a
plan of union, drafted mainly, it seems, by benjamin franklin, was
adopted and sent to the colonies and the crown for approval. the
colonies, jealous of their individual rights, refused to accept the
scheme and the king disapproved it for the reason, franklin said, that
it had "too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution."
though the albany union failed, the document is still worthy of study
because it forecast many of the perplexing problems that were not solved
until thirty-three years afterward, when another convention of which
also franklin was a member drafted the constitution of the united
states.

[illustration: benjamin franklin]

=the military education of the colonists.=--the same wars that showed
the provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art
of defending their institutions. particularly was this true of the last
french and indian conflict, which stretched all the way from maine to
the carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops. the answer,
it is admitted, was far from satisfactory to the british government and
the conduct of the militiamen was far from professional; but thousands
of americans got a taste, a strong taste, of actual fighting in the
field. men like george washington and daniel morgan learned lessons that
were not forgotten in after years. they saw what american militiamen
could do under favorable circumstances and they watched british regulars
operating on american soil. "this whole transaction," shrewdly remarked
franklin of braddock's campaign, "gave us americans the first suspicion
that our exalted ideas of the prowess of british regular troops had not
been well founded." it was no mere accident that the virginia colonel
who drew his sword under the elm at cambridge and took command of the
army of the revolution was the brave officer who had "spurned the
whistle of bullets" at the memorable battle in western pennsylvania.

=financial burdens and commercial disorder.=--while the provincials were
learning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills. all the
conflicts were costly in treasure as in blood. king philip's war left
new england weak and almost bankrupt. the french and indian struggle was
especially expensive. the twenty-five thousand men put in the field by
the colonies were sustained only by huge outlays of money. paper
currency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated. commerce
was driven from its usual channels and prices were enhanced. when the
end came, both england and america were staggering under heavy
liabilities, and to make matters worse there was a fall of prices
accompanied by a commercial depression which extended over a period of
ten years. it was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation
had to be devised to pay the cost of the war, precipitating the quarrel
which led to american independence.

=the expulsion of french power from north america.=--the effects of the
defeat administered to france, as time proved, were difficult to
estimate. some british statesmen regarded it as a happy circumstance
that the colonists, already restive under their administration, had no
foreign power at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence.
american leaders, on the other hand, now that the soldiers of king louis
were driven from the continent, thought that they had no other country
to fear if they cast off british sovereignty. at all events, france,
though defeated, was not out of the sphere of american influence; for,
as events proved, it was the fortunate french alliance negotiated by
franklin that assured the triumph of american arms in the war of the
revolution.


colonial relations with the british government

it was neither the indian wars nor the french wars that finally brought
forth american nationality. that was the product of the long strife
with the mother country which culminated in union for the war of
independence. the forces that created this nation did not operate in the
colonies alone. the character of the english sovereigns, the course of
events in english domestic politics, and english measures of control
over the colonies--executive, legislative, and judicial--must all be
taken into account.

=the last of the stuarts.=--the struggles between charles i (1625-49)
and the parliamentary party and the turmoil of the puritan regime
(1649-60) so engrossed the attention of englishmen at home that they had
little time to think of colonial policies or to interfere with colonial
affairs. the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, accompanied by
internal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the
house of commons, changed all that. in the reign of charles ii
(1660-85), himself an easy-going person, the policy of regulating trade
by act of parliament was developed into a closely knit system and
powerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created. at the same
time a system of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by
the annulment of the old charter of massachusetts which conferred so
much self-government on the puritans.

charles' successor, james ii, a man of sterner stuff and jealous of his
authority in the colonies as well as at home, continued the policy thus
inaugurated and enlarged upon it. if he could have kept his throne, he
would have bent the americans under a harsh rule or brought on in his
dominions a revolution like that which he precipitated at home in 1688.
he determined to unite the northern colonies and introduce a more
efficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces. he
made a martinet, sir edmund andros, governor of all new england, new
york, and new jersey. the charter of massachusetts, annulled in the last
days of his brother's reign, he continued to ignore, and that of
connecticut would have been seized if it had not been spirited away and
hidden, according to tradition, in a hollow oak.

for several months, andros gave the northern colonies a taste of
ill-tempered despotism. he wrung quit rents from land owners not
accustomed to feudal dues; he abrogated titles to land where, in his
opinion, they were unlawful; he forced the episcopal service upon the
old south church in boston; and he denied the writ of _habeas corpus_ to
a preacher who denounced taxation without representation. in the middle
of his arbitrary course, however, his hand was stayed. the news came
that king james had been dethroned by his angry subjects, and the people
of boston, kindling a fire on beacon hill, summoned the countryside to
dispose of andros. the response was prompt and hearty. the hated
governor was arrested, imprisoned, and sent back across the sea under
guard.

the overthrow of james, followed by the accession of william and mary
and by assured parliamentary supremacy, had an immediate effect in the
colonies. the new order was greeted with thanksgiving. massachusetts was
given another charter which, though not so liberal as the first,
restored the spirit if not the entire letter of self-government. in the
other colonies where andros had been operating, the old course of
affairs was resumed.

=the indifference of the first two georges.=--on the death in 1714 of
queen anne, the successor of king william, the throne passed to a
hanoverian prince who, though grateful for english honors and revenues,
was more interested in hanover than in england. george i and george ii,
whose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760, never even learned to
speak the english language, at least without an accent. the necessity of
taking thought about colonial affairs bored both of them so that the
stoutest defender of popular privileges in boston or charleston had no
ground to complain of the exercise of personal prerogatives by the king.
moreover, during a large part of this period, the direction of affairs
was in the hands of an astute leader, sir robert walpole, who betrayed
his somewhat cynical view of politics by adopting as his motto: "let
sleeping dogs lie." he revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment
by exclaiming: "i will not be the minister to enforce taxes at the
expense of blood." such kings and such ministers were not likely to
arouse the slumbering resistance of the thirteen colonies across the
sea.

=control of the crown over the colonies.=--while no english ruler from
james ii to george iii ventured to interfere with colonial matters
personally, constant control over the colonies was exercised by royal
officers acting under the authority of the crown. systematic supervision
began in 1660, when there was created by royal order a committee of the
king's council to meet on mondays and thursdays of each week to consider
petitions, memorials, and addresses respecting the plantations. in 1696
a regular board was established, known as the "lords of trade and
plantations," which continued, until the american revolution, to
scrutinize closely colonial business. the chief duties of the board were
to examine acts of colonial legislatures, to recommend measures to those
assemblies for adoption, and to hear memorials and petitions from the
colonies relative to their affairs.

the methods employed by this board were varied. all laws passed by
american legislatures came before it for review as a matter of routine.
if it found an act unsatisfactory, it recommended to the king the
exercise of his veto power, known as the royal disallowance. any person
who believed his personal or property rights injured by a colonial law
could be heard by the board in person or by attorney; in such cases it
was the practice to hear at the same time the agent of the colony so
involved. the royal veto power over colonial legislation was not,
therefore, a formal affair, but was constantly employed on the
suggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown. all this was in
addition to the powers exercised by the governors in the royal
provinces.

=judicial control.=--supplementing this administrative control over the
colonies was a constant supervision by the english courts of law. the
king, by virtue of his inherent authority, claimed and exercised high
appellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empire. the right
of appeal from local courts, expressly set forth in some charters, was,
on the eve of the revolution, maintained in every colony. any subject in
england or america, who, in the regular legal course, was aggrieved by
any act of a colonial legislature or any decision of a colonial court,
had the right, subject to certain regulations, to carry his case to the
king in council, forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea. in
the exercise of appellate power, the king in council acting as a court
could, and frequently did, declare acts of colonial legislatures duly
enacted and approved, null and void, on the ground that they were
contrary to english law.

=imperial control in operation.=--day after day, week after week, year
after year, the machinery for political and judicial control over
colonial affairs was in operation. at one time the british governors in
the colonies were ordered not to approve any colonial law imposing a
duty on european goods imported in english vessels. again, when north
carolina laid a tax on peddlers, the council objected to it as
"restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of english manufactures
throughout the continent." at other times, indian trade was regulated in
the interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a colonial
legislature were set aside. virginia was forbidden to close her ports to
north carolina lest there should be retaliation.

in short, foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control
higher than that of the colony, foreshadowing a day when the
constitution of the united states was to commit to congress the power to
regulate interstate and foreign commerce and commerce with the indians.
a superior judicial power, towering above that of the colonies, as the
supreme court at washington now towers above the states, kept the
colonial legislatures within the metes and bounds of established law. in
the thousands of appeals, memorials, petitions, and complaints, and the
rulings and decisions upon them, were written the real history of
british imperial control over the american colonies.

so great was the business before the lords of trade that the colonies
had to keep skilled agents in london to protect their interests. as
common grievances against the operation of this machinery of control
arose, there appeared in each colony a considerable body of men, with
the merchants in the lead, who chafed at the restraints imposed on their
enterprise. only a powerful blow was needed to weld these bodies into a
common mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism. when to the
repeated minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of
parliament applying to every colony, the rebound came in the revolution.

=parliamentary control over colonial affairs.=--as soon as parliament
gained in power at the expense of the king, it reached out to bring the
american colonies under its sway as well. between the execution of
charles i and the accession of george iii, there was enacted an immense
body of legislation regulating the shipping, trade, and manufactures of
america. all of it, based on the "mercantile" theory then prevalent in
all countries of europe, was designed to control the overseas
plantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and business
interests of the mother country, where merchants and men of finance had
got the upper hand. according to this theory, the colonies of the
british empire should be confined to agriculture and the production of
raw materials, and forced to buy their manufactured goods of england.

_the navigation acts._--in the first rank among these measures of
british colonial policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for
the purpose of building up the british merchant marine and navy--arms so
essential in defending the colonies against the spanish, dutch, and
french. the beginning of this type of legislation was made in 1651 and
it was worked out into a system early in the reign of charles ii
(1660-85).

the navigation acts, in effect, gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to
british ships. no trade could be carried on between great britain and
her dominions save in vessels built and manned by british subjects. no
european goods could be brought to america save in the ships of the
country that produced them or in english ships. these laws, which were
almost fatal to dutch shipping in america, fell with severity upon the
colonists, compelling them to pay higher freight rates. the adverse
effect, however, was short-lived, for the measures stimulated
shipbuilding in the colonies, where the abundance of raw materials gave
the master builders of america an advantage over those of the mother
country. thus the colonists in the end profited from the restrictive
policy written into the navigation acts.

_the acts against manufactures._--the second group of laws was
deliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from competing too
sharply with those of england. among the earliest of these measures may
be counted the woolen act of 1699, forbidding the exportation of woolen
goods from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and
colonies. when parliament learned, as the result of an inquiry, that new
england and new york were making thousands of hats a year and sending
large numbers annually to the southern colonies and to ireland, spain,
and portugal, it enacted in 1732 a law declaring that "no hats or felts,
dyed or undyed, finished or unfinished" should be "put upon any vessel
or laden upon any horse or cart with intent to export to any place
whatever." the effect of this measure upon the hat industry was almost
ruinous. a few years later a similar blow was given to the iron
industry. by an act of 1750, pig and bar iron from the colonies were
given free entry to england to encourage the production of the raw
material; but at the same time the law provided that "no mill or other
engine for slitting or rolling of iron, no plating forge to work with a
tilt hammer, and no furnace for making steel" should be built in the
colonies. as for those already built, they were declared public
nuisances and ordered closed. thus three important economic interests of
the colonists, the woolen, hat, and iron industries, were laid under the
ban.

_the trade laws._--the third group of restrictive measures passed by the
british parliament related to the sale of colonial produce. an act of
1663 required the colonies to export certain articles to great britain
or to her dominions alone; while sugar, tobacco, and ginger consigned to
the continent of europe had to pass through a british port paying custom
duties and through a british merchant's hands paying the usual
commission. at first tobacco was the only one of the "enumerated
articles" which seriously concerned the american colonies, the rest
coming mainly from the british west indies. in the course of time,
however, other commodities were added to the list of enumerated
articles, until by 1764 it embraced rice, naval stores, copper, furs,
hides, iron, lumber, and pearl ashes. this was not all. the colonies
were compelled to bring their european purchases back through english
ports, paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants
again.

_the molasses act._--not content with laws enacted in the interest of
english merchants and manufacturers, parliament sought to protect the
british west indies against competition from their french and dutch
neighbors. new england merchants had long carried on a lucrative trade
with the french islands in the west indies and dutch guiana, where sugar
and molasses could be obtained in large quantities at low prices. acting
on the protests of english planters in the barbadoes and jamaica,
parliament, in 1733, passed the famous molasses act imposing duties on
sugar and molasses imported into the colonies from foreign
countries--rates which would have destroyed the american trade with the
french and dutch if the law had been enforced. the duties, however, were
not collected. the molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on
merrily, smuggling taking the place of lawful traffic.

=effect of the laws in america.=--as compared with the strict monopoly
of her colonial trade which spain consistently sought to maintain, the
policy of england was both moderate and liberal. furthermore, the
restrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to be
favorable to colonial prosperity. the navigation acts, for example,
redounded to the advantage of american shipbuilders and the producers
of hemp, tar, lumber, and ship stores in general. favors in british
ports were granted to colonial producers as against foreign competitors
and in some instances bounties were paid by england to encourage
colonial enterprise. taken all in all, there is much justification in
the argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the
colonists gained more than they lost by british trade and industrial
legislation. certainly after the establishment of independence, when
free from these old restrictions, the americans found themselves
handicapped by being treated as foreigners rather than favored traders
and the recipients of bounties in english markets.

be that as it may, it appears that the colonists felt little irritation
against the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws
enacted previous to the close of the french and indian war. relatively
few were engaged in the hat and iron industries as compared with those
in farming and planting, so that england's policy of restricting america
to agriculture did not conflict with the interests of the majority of
the inhabitants. the woolen industry was largely in the hands of women
and carried on in connection with their domestic duties, so that it was
not the sole support of any considerable number of people.

as a matter of fact, moreover, the restrictive laws, especially those
relating to trade, were not rigidly enforced. cargoes of tobacco were
boldly sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the
english government, to which duties should have been paid. sugar and
molasses from the french and dutch colonies were shipped into new
england in spite of the law. royal officers sometimes protested against
smuggling and sometimes connived at it; but at no time did they succeed
in stopping it. taken all in all, very little was heard of "the galling
restraints of trade" until after the french war, when the british
government suddenly entered upon a new course.


summary of the colonial period

in the period between the landing of the english at jamestown, virginia,
in 1607, and the close of the french and indian war in 1763--a period of
a century and a half--a new nation was being prepared on this continent
to take its place among the powers of the earth. it was an epoch of
migration. western europe contributed emigrants of many races and
nationalities. the english led the way. next to them in numerical
importance were the scotch-irish and the germans. into the melting pot
were also cast dutch, swedes, french, jews, welsh, and irish. thousands
of negroes were brought from africa to till southern fields or labor as
domestic servants in the north.

why did they come? the reasons are various. some of them, the pilgrims
and puritans of new england, the french huguenots, scotch-irish and
irish, and the catholics of maryland, fled from intolerant governments
that denied them the right to worship god according to the dictates of
their consciences. thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in
the old world and to find free homes in america. thousands, like the
negroes from africa, were dragged here against their will. the lure of
adventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the
enterprising merchants.

how did they come? in some cases religious brotherhoods banded together
and borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way. in other
cases great trading companies were organized to found colonies. again it
was the wealthy proprietor, like lord baltimore or william penn, who
undertook to plant settlements. many immigrants were able to pay their
own way across the sea. others bound themselves out for a term of years
in exchange for the cost of the passage. negroes were brought on account
of the profits derived from their sale as slaves.

whatever the motive for their coming, however, they managed to get
across the sea. the immigrants set to work with a will. they cut down
forests, built houses, and laid out fields. they founded churches,
schools, and colleges. they set up forges and workshops. they spun and
wove. they fashioned ships and sailed the seas. they bartered and
traded. here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of
commerce--boston, providence, new york, philadelphia, baltimore, and
charleston. as soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line
they pressed westward until, by the close of the colonial period, they
were already on the crest of the alleghanies.

though they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast,
the colonists were united in spirit by many common ties. the major
portion of them were protestants. the language, the law, and the
literature of england furnished the basis of national unity. most of the
colonists were engaged in the same hard task; that of conquering a
wilderness. to ties of kinship and language were added ties created by
necessity. they had to unite in defense; first, against the indians and
later against the french. they were all subjects of the same
sovereign--the king of england. the english parliament made laws for
them and the english government supervised their local affairs, their
trade, and their manufactures. common forces assailed them. common
grievances vexed them. common hopes inspired them.

many of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw
them into opposition to the british crown and parliament. most of them
were freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their own land and tilled
it with their own hands. a free soil nourished the spirit of freedom.
the majority of them were dissenters, critics, not friends, of the
church of england, that stanch defender of the british monarchy. each
colony in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters; it
grew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself. here was a
people learning self-reliance and self-government. the attempts to
strengthen the church of england in america and the transformation of
colonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence
which they were designed to quench.

nevertheless, the americans owed much of their prosperity to the
assistance of the government that irritated them. it was the protection
of the british navy that prevented holland, spain, and france from
wiping out their settlements. though their manufacture and trade were
controlled in the interests of the mother country, they also enjoyed
great advantages in her markets. free trade existed nowhere upon the
earth; but the broad empire of britain was open to american ships and
merchandise. it could be said, with good reason, that the disadvantages
which the colonists suffered through british regulation of their
industry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed.
still that is somewhat beside the point, for mere economic advantage is
not necessarily the determining factor in the fate of peoples. a
thousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation,
to inspire it with a passion for independence, and to prepare it for a
destiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the british
empire. the economists, who tried to prove by logic unassailable that
america would be richer under the british flag, could not change the
spirit of patrick henry, samuel adams, benjamin franklin, or george
washington.

part ii. conflict and independence




chapter v

the new course in british imperial policy


on october 25, 1760, king george ii died and the british crown passed to
his young grandson. the first george, the son of the elector of hanover
and sophia the granddaughter of james i, was a thorough german who never
even learned to speak the language of the land over which he reigned.
the second george never saw england until he was a man. he spoke english
with an accent and until his death preferred his german home. during
their reign, the principle had become well established that the king did
not govern but acted only through ministers representing the majority in
parliament.


george iii and his system

=the character of the new king.=--the third george rudely broke the
german tradition of his family. he resented the imputation that he was a
foreigner and on all occasions made a display of his british sympathies.
to the draft of his first speech to parliament, he added the popular
phrase: "born and educated in this country, i glory in the name of
briton." macaulay, the english historian, certainly of no liking for
high royal prerogative, said of george: "the young king was a born
englishman. all his tastes and habits, good and bad, were english. no
portion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with.... his age,
his appearance, and all that was known of his character conciliated
public favor. he was in the bloom of youth; his person and address were
pleasing; scandal imputed to him no vice; and flattery might without
glaring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtues."

nevertheless george iii had been spoiled by his mother, his tutors, and
his courtiers. under their influence he developed high and mighty
notions about the sacredness of royal authority and his duty to check
the pretensions of parliament and the ministers dependent upon it. his
mother had dinned into his ears the slogan: "george, be king!" lord
bute, his teacher and adviser, had told him that his honor required him
to take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the making of
laws. thus educated, he surrounded himself with courtiers who encouraged
him in the determination to rule as well as reign, to subdue all
parties, and to place himself at the head of the nation and empire.

[illustration: _from an old print._

george iii]

=political parties and george iii.=--the state of the political parties
favored the plans of the king to restore some of the ancient luster of
the crown. the whigs, who were composed mainly of the smaller
freeholders, merchants, inhabitants of towns, and protestant
non-conformists, had grown haughty and overbearing through long
continuance in power and had as a consequence raised up many enemies in
their own ranks. their opponents, the tories, had by this time given up
all hope of restoring to the throne the direct stuart line; but they
still cherished their old notions about divine right. with the
accession of george iii the coveted opportunity came to them to rally
around the throne again. george received his tory friends with open
arms, gave them offices, and bought them seats in the house of commons.

=the british parliamentary system.=--the peculiarities of the british
parliament at the time made smooth the way for the king and his allies
with their designs for controlling the entire government. in the first
place, the house of lords was composed mainly of hereditary nobles whose
number the king could increase by the appointment of his favorites, as
of old. though the members of the house of commons were elected by
popular vote, they did not speak for the mass of english people. great
towns like leeds, manchester, and birmingham, for example, had no
representatives at all. while there were about eight million inhabitants
in great britain, there were in 1768 only about 160,000 voters; that is
to say, only about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the
government. many boroughs returned one or more members to the commons
although they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances no
voters at all. furthermore, these tiny boroughs were often controlled by
lords who openly sold the right of representation to the highest bidder.
the "rotten-boroughs," as they were called by reformers, were a public
scandal, but george iii readily made use of them to get his friends into
the house of commons.


george iii's ministers and their colonial policies

=grenville and the war debt.=--within a year after the accession of
george iii, william pitt was turned out of office, the king treating him
with "gross incivility" and the crowds shouting "pitt forever!" the
direction of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying the king's
confidence. leadership in the house of commons fell to george grenville,
a grave and laborious man who for years had groaned over the increasing
cost of government.

the first task after the conclusion of peace in 1763 was the adjustment
of the disordered finances of the kingdom. the debt stood at the highest
point in the history of the country. more revenue was absolutely
necessary and grenville began to search for it, turning his attention
finally to the american colonies. in this quest he had the aid of a
zealous colleague, charles townshend, who had long been in public
service and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal
governors in america. these two men, with the support of the entire
ministry, inaugurated in february, 1763, "a new system of colonial
government. it was announced by authority that there were to be no more
requisitions from the king to the colonial assemblies for supplies, but
that the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of parliament.
colonial governors and judges were to be paid by the crown; they were to
be supported by a standing army of twenty regiments; and all the
expenses of this force were to be met by parliamentary taxation."

=restriction of paper money (1763).=--among the many complaints filed
before the board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of
paper money by the colonial legislatures. the new ministry provided a
remedy in the act of 1763, which declared void all colonial laws
authorizing paper money or extending the life of outstanding bills. this
law was aimed at the "cheap money" which the americans were fond of
making when specie was scarce--money which they tried to force on their
english creditors in return for goods and in payment of the interest and
principal of debts. thus the first chapter was written in the long
battle over sound money on this continent.

=limitation on western land sales.=--later in the same year (1763)
george iii issued a royal proclamation providing, among other things,
for the government of the territory recently acquired by the treaty of
paris from the french. one of the provisions in this royal decree
touched frontiersmen to the quick. the contests between the king's
officers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had
been long and sharp. the americans chafed at restrictions on
settlement. the more adventurous were continually moving west and
"squatting" on land purchased from the indians or simply seized without
authority. to put an end to this, the king forbade all further purchases
from the indians, reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands
and dispose of them for settlement. a second provision in the same
proclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the indians,
including the lucrative fur business, in the hands of royal officers in
the colonies. these two limitations on american freedom and enterprise
were declared to be in the interest of the crown and for the
preservation of the rights of the indians against fraud and abuses.

=the sugar act of 1764.=--king george's ministers next turned their
attention to measures of taxation and trade. since the heavy debt under
which england was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense of
america, nothing seemed more reasonable to them than the proposition
that the colonies should help to bear the burden which fell so heavily
upon the english taxpayer. the sugar act of 1764 was the result of this
reasoning. there was no doubt about the purpose of this law, for it was
set forth clearly in the title: "an act for granting certain duties in
the british colonies and plantations in america ... for applying the
produce of such duties ... towards defraying the expenses of defending,
protecting and securing the said colonies and plantations ... and for
more effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and
from the said colonies and plantations and improving and securing the
trade between the same and great britain." the old molasses act had been
prohibitive; the sugar act of 1764 was clearly intended as a revenue
measure. specified duties were laid upon sugar, indigo, calico, silks,
and many other commodities imported into the colonies. the enforcement
of the molasses act had been utterly neglected; but this sugar act had
"teeth in it." special precautions as to bonds, security, and
registration of ship masters, accompanied by heavy penalties, promised
a vigorous execution of the new revenue law.

the strict terms of the sugar act were strengthened by administrative
measures. under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed
vessels stationed along the american coast were authorized to stop,
search, and, on suspicion, seize merchant ships approaching colonial
ports. by supplementary orders, the entire british official force in
america was instructed to be diligent in the execution of all trade and
navigation laws. revenue collectors, officers of the army and navy, and
royal governors were curtly ordered to the front to do their full duty
in the matter of law enforcement. the ordinary motives for the discharge
of official obligations were sharpened by an appeal to avarice, for
naval officers who seized offenders against the law were rewarded by
large prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties.

=the stamp act (1765).=--the grenville-townshend combination moved
steadily towards its goal. while the sugar act was under consideration
in parliament, grenville announced a plan for a stamp bill. the next
year it went through both houses with a speed that must have astounded
its authors. the vote in the commons stood 205 in favor to 49 against;
while in the lords it was not even necessary to go through the formality
of a count. as george iii was temporarily insane, the measure received
royal assent by a commission acting as a board of regency. protests of
colonial agents in london were futile. "we might as well have hindered
the sun's progress!" exclaimed franklin. protests of a few opponents in
the commons were equally vain. the ministry was firm in its course and
from all appearances the stamp act hardly roused as much as a languid
interest in the city of london. in fact, it is recorded that the fateful
measure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a commission to
act for the king when he was incapacitated.

the stamp act, like the sugar act, declared the purpose of the british
government to raise revenue in america "towards defraying the expenses
of defending, protecting, and securing the british colonies and
plantations in america." it was a long measure of more than fifty
sections, carefully planned and skillfully drawn. by its provisions
duties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal
transactions,--deeds, mortgages, inventories, writs, bail bonds,--on
licenses to practice law and sell liquor, on college diplomas, playing
cards, dice, pamphlets, newspapers, almanacs, calendars, and
advertisements. the drag net was closely knit, for scarcely anything
escaped.

=the quartering act (1765).=--the ministers were aware that the stamp
act would rouse opposition in america--how great they could not
conjecture. while the measure was being debated, a friend of general
wolfe, colonel barre, who knew america well, gave them an ominous
warning in the commons. "believe me--remember i this day told you so--"
he exclaimed, "the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at
first will accompany them still ... a people jealous of their liberties
and who will vindicate them, if ever they should be violated." the
answer of the ministry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force.
preparations were accordingly made to dispatch a larger number of
soldiers than usual to the colonies, and the ink was hardly dry on the
stamp act when parliament passed the quartering act ordering the
colonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce
the new laws. "we have the power to tax them," said one of the ministry,
"and we will tax them."


colonial resistance forces repeal

=popular opposition.=--the stamp act was greeted in america by an
outburst of denunciation. the merchants of the seaboard cities took the
lead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest, agreeing not to
import british goods while the hated law stood upon the books. lawyers,
some of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operations and others
intimidated by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped
papers, joined with the merchants. aristocratic colonial whigs, who had
long grumbled at the administration of royal governors, protested
against taxation without their consent, as the whigs had done in old
england. there were tories, however, in the colonies as in england--many
of them of the official class--who denounced the merchants, lawyers, and
whig aristocrats as "seditious, factious and republican." yet the
opposition to the stamp act and its accompanying measure, the quartering
act, grew steadily all through the summer of 1765.

in a little while it was taken up in the streets and along the
countryside. all through the north and in some of the southern colonies,
there sprang up, as if by magic, committees and societies pledged to
resist the stamp act to the bitter end. these popular societies were
known as sons of liberty and daughters of liberty: the former including
artisans, mechanics, and laborers; and the latter, patriotic women. both
groups were alike in that they had as yet taken little part in public
affairs. many artisans, as well as all the women, were excluded from the
right to vote for colonial assemblymen.

while the merchants and whig gentlemen confined their efforts chiefly to
drafting well-phrased protests against british measures, the sons of
liberty operated in the streets and chose rougher measures. they stirred
up riots in boston, new york, philadelphia, and charleston when attempts
were made to sell the stamps. they sacked and burned the residences of
high royal officers. they organized committees of inquisition who by
threats and intimidation curtailed the sale of british goods and the use
of stamped papers. in fact, the sons of liberty carried their operations
to such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were
frightened and drew back in astonishment at the forces they had
unloosed. the daughters of liberty in a quieter way were making a very
effective resistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on
domestic industries, their own particular province being the manufacture
of clothing, and devising substitutes for taxed foods. they helped to
feed and clothe their families without buying british goods.

=legislative action against the stamp act.=--leaders in the colonial
assemblies, accustomed to battle against british policies, supported the
popular protest. the stamp act was signed on march 22, 1765. on may 30,
the virginia house of burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring
that the general assembly of the colony alone had the right to lay taxes
upon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwise were
"illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust." it was in support of these
resolutions that patrick henry uttered the immortal challenge: "caesar
had his brutus, charles i his cromwell, and george iii...." cries of
"treason" were calmly met by the orator who finished: "george iii may
profit by their example. if that be treason, make the most of it."

=the stamp act congress.=--the massachusetts assembly answered the call
of virginia by inviting the colonies to elect delegates to a congress to
be held in new york to discuss the situation. nine colonies responded
and sent representatives. the delegates, while professing the warmest
affection for the king's person and government, firmly spread on record
a series of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning. they
declared that taxes could not be imposed without their consent, given
through their respective colonial assemblies; that the stamp act showed
a tendency to subvert their rights and liberties; that the recent trade
acts were burdensome and grievous; and that the right to petition the
king and parliament was their heritage. they thereupon made "humble
supplication" for the repeal of the stamp act.

the stamp act congress was more than an assembly of protest. it marked
the rise of a new agency of government to express the will of america.
it was the germ of a government which in time was to supersede the
government of george iii in the colonies. it foreshadowed the congress
of the united states under the constitution. it was a successful attempt
at union. "there ought to be no new england men," declared christopher
gadsden, in the stamp act congress, "no new yorkers known on the
continent, but all of us americans."

=the repeal of the stamp act and the sugar act.=--the effect of american
resistance on opinion in england was telling. commerce with the colonies
had been effectively boycotted by the americans; ships lay idly swinging
at the wharves; bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants in london,
bristol, and liverpool. workingmen in the manufacturing towns of england
were thrown out of employment. the government had sown folly and was
reaping, in place of the coveted revenue, rebellion.

perplexed by the storm they had raised, the ministers summoned to the
bar of the house of commons, benjamin franklin, the agent for
pennsylvania, who was in london. "do you think it right," asked
grenville, "that america should be protected by this country and pay no
part of the expenses?" the answer was brief: "that is not the case; the
colonies raised, clothed, and paid during the last war twenty-five
thousand men and spent many millions." then came an inquiry whether the
colonists would accept a modified stamp act. "no, never," replied
franklin, "never! they will never submit to it!" it was next suggested
that military force might compel obedience to law. franklin had a ready
answer. "they cannot force a man to take stamps.... they may not find a
rebellion; they may, indeed, make one."

the repeal of the stamp act was moved in the house of commons a few days
later. the sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted, debts
due british merchants placed in jeopardy, manchester industries closed,
workingmen unemployed, oppression instituted, and the loss of the
colonies threatened. pitt and edmund burke, the former near the close
of his career, the latter just beginning his, argued cogently in favor
of retracing the steps taken the year before. grenville refused.
"america must learn," he wailed, "that prayers are not to be brought to
caesar through riot and sedition." his protests were idle. the commons
agreed to the repeal on february 22, 1766, amid the cheers of the
victorious majority. it was carried through the lords in the face of
strong opposition and, on march 18, reluctantly signed by the king, now
restored to his right mind.

in rescinding the stamp act, parliament did not admit the contention of
the americans that it was without power to tax them. on the contrary, it
accompanied the repeal with a declaratory act. it announced that the
colonies were subordinate to the crown and parliament of great britain;
that the king and parliament therefore had undoubted authority to make
laws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and that the
resolutions and proceedings of the colonists denying such authority were
null and void.

the repeal was greeted by the colonists with great popular
demonstrations. bells were rung; toasts to the king were drunk; and
trade resumed its normal course. the declaratory act, as a mere paper
resolution, did not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered
the name of king george. their confidence was soon strengthened by the
news that even the sugar act had been repealed, thus practically
restoring the condition of affairs before grenville and townshend
inaugurated their policy of "thoroughness."


resumption of british revenue and commercial policies

=the townshend acts (1767).=--the triumph of the colonists was brief.
though pitt, the friend of america, was once more prime minister, and
seated in the house of lords as the earl of chatham, his severe illness
gave to townshend and the tory party practical control over parliament.
unconvinced by the experience with the stamp act, townshend brought
forward and pushed through both houses of parliament three measures,
which to this day are associated with his name. first among his
restrictive laws was that of june 29, 1767, which placed the enforcement
of the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports
in the hands of british commissioners appointed by the king, resident in
the colonies, paid from the british treasury, and independent of all
control by the colonists. the second measure of the same date imposed a
tax on lead, glass, paint, tea, and a few other articles imported into
the colonies, the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward
the payment of the salaries and other expenses of royal colonial
officials. a third measure was the tea act of july 2, 1767, aimed at the
tea trade which the americans carried on illegally with foreigners. this
law abolished the duty which the east india company had to pay in
england on tea exported to america, for it was thought that english tea
merchants might thus find it possible to undersell american tea
smugglers.

=writs of assistance legalized by parliament.=--had parliament been
content with laying duties, just as a manifestation of power and right,
and neglected their collection, perhaps little would have been heard of
the townshend acts. it provided, however, for the strict, even the
harsh, enforcement of the law. it ordered customs officers to remain at
their posts and put an end to smuggling. in the revenue act of june 29,
1767, it expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to
issue "writs of assistance," empowering customs officers to enter "any
house, warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place in the british colonies
or plantations in america to search for and seize" prohibited or
smuggled goods.

the writ of assistance, which was a general search warrant issued to
revenue officers, was an ancient device hateful to a people who
cherished the spirit of personal independence and who had made actual
gains in the practice of civil liberty. to allow a "minion of the law"
to enter a man's house and search his papers and premises, was too much
for the emotions of people who had fled to america in a quest for
self-government and free homes, who had braved such hardships to
establish them, and who wanted to trade without official interference.

the writ of assistance had been used in massachusetts in 1755 to prevent
illicit trade with canada and had aroused a violent hostility at that
time. in 1761 it was again the subject of a bitter controversy which
arose in connection with the application of a customs officer to a
massachusetts court for writs of assistance "as usual." this application
was vainly opposed by james otis in a speech of five hours' duration--a
speech of such fire and eloquence that it sent every man who heard it
away "ready to take up arms against writs of assistance." otis denounced
the practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king
his head and another his throne, a tyrant's device which placed the
liberty of every man in jeopardy, enabling any petty officer to work
possible malice on any innocent citizen on the merest suspicion, and to
spread terror and desolation through the land. "what a scene," he
exclaimed, "does this open! every man, prompted by revenge, ill-humor,
or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbor's house, may get a
writ of assistance. others will ask it from self-defense; one arbitrary
exertion will provoke another until society is involved in tumult and
blood." he did more than attack the writ itself. he said that parliament
could not establish it because it was against the british constitution.
this was an assertion resting on slender foundation, but it was quickly
echoed by the people. then and there james otis sounded the call to
america to resist the exercise of arbitrary power by royal officers.
"then and there," wrote john adams, "the child independence was born."
such was the hated writ that townshend proposed to put into the hands of
customs officers in his grim determination to enforce the law.

=the new york assembly suspended.=--in the very month that townshend's
acts were signed by the king, parliament took a still more drastic step.
the assembly of new york, protesting against the "ruinous and
insupportable" expense involved, had failed to make provision for the
care of british troops in accordance with the terms of the quartering
act. parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to
obey the law. it was not until a third election was held that compliance
with the quartering act was wrung from the reluctant province. in the
meantime, all the colonies had learned on how frail a foundation their
representative bodies rested.


renewed resistance in america

=the massachusetts circular (1768).=--massachusetts, under the
leadership of samuel adams, resolved to resist the policy of renewed
intervention in america. at his suggestion the assembly adopted a
circular letter addressed to the assemblies of the other colonies
informing them of the state of affairs in massachusetts and roundly
condemning the whole british program. the circular letter declared that
parliament had no right to lay taxes on americans without their consent
and that the colonists could not, from the nature of the case, be
represented in parliament. it went on shrewdly to submit to
consideration the question as to whether any people could be called free
who were subjected to governors and judges appointed by the crown and
paid out of funds raised independently. it invited the other colonies,
in the most temperate tones, to take thought about the common
predicament in which they were all placed.

[illustration: _from an old print._

samuel adams]

=the dissolution of assemblies.=--the governor of massachusetts, hearing
of the circular letter, ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal. on
meeting refusal, he promptly dissolved it. the maryland, georgia, and
south carolina assemblies indorsed the circular letter and were also
dissolved at once. the virginia house of burgesses, thoroughly aroused,
passed resolutions on may 16, 1769, declaring that the sole right of
imposing taxes in virginia was vested in its legislature, asserting anew
the right of petition to the crown, condemning the transportation of
persons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas, and beseeching the
king for a redress of the general grievances. the immediate dissolution
of the virginia assembly, in its turn, was the answer of the royal
governor.

=the boston massacre.=--american opposition to the british authorities
kept steadily rising as assemblies were dissolved, the houses of
citizens searched, and troops distributed in increasing numbers among
the centers of discontent. merchants again agreed not to import british
goods, the sons of liberty renewed their agitation, and women set about
the patronage of home products still more loyally.

on the night of march 5, 1770, a crowd on the streets of boston began to
jostle and tease some british regulars stationed in the town. things
went from bad to worse until some "boys and young fellows" began to
throw snowballs and stones. then the exasperated soldiers fired into the
crowd, killing five and wounding half a dozen more. the day after the
"massacre," a mass meeting was held in the town and samuel adams was
sent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers. the governor hesitated
and tried to compromise. finding adams relentless, the governor yielded
and ordered the regulars away.

the boston massacre stirred the country from new hampshire to georgia.
popular passions ran high. the guilty soldiers were charged with murder.
their defense was undertaken, in spite of the wrath of the populace, by
john adams and josiah quincy, who as lawyers thought even the worst

offenders entitled to their full rights in law. in his speech to the
jury, however, adams warned the british government against its course,
saying, that "from the nature of things soldiers quartered in a populous
town will always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one." two of
the soldiers were convicted and lightly punished.

=resistance in the south.=--the year following the boston massacre some
citizens of north carolina, goaded by the conduct of the royal governor,
openly resisted his authority. many were killed as a result and seven
who were taken prisoners were hanged as traitors. a little later royal
troops and local militia met in a pitched battle near alamance river,
called the "lexington of the south."

=the _gaspee_ affair and the virginia resolutions of 1773.=--on sea as
well as on land, friction between the royal officers and the colonists
broke out into overt acts. while patrolling narragansett bay looking for
smugglers one day in 1772, the armed ship, _gaspee_, ran ashore and was
caught fast. during the night several men from providence boarded the
vessel and, after seizing the crew, set it on fire. a royal commission,
sent to rhode island to discover the offenders and bring them to
account, failed because it could not find a single informer. the very
appointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of virginia to
action; and in march, 1773, the house of burgesses passed a resolution
creating a standing committee of correspondence to develop cooperation
among the colonies in resistance to british measures.

=the boston tea party.=--although the british government, finding the
townshend revenue act a failure, repealed in 1770 all the duties except
that on tea, it in no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the other
commercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies. moreover,
parliament decided to relieve the british east india company of the
financial difficulties into which it had fallen partly by reason of the
tea act and the colonial boycott that followed. in 1773 it agreed to
return to the company the regular import duties, levied in england, on
all tea transshipped to america. a small impost of three pence, to be
collected in america, was left as a reminder of the principle laid down
in the declaratory act that parliament had the right to tax the
colonists.

this arrangement with the east india company was obnoxious to the
colonists for several reasons. it was an act of favoritism for one
thing, in the interest of a great monopoly. for another thing, it
promised to dump on the american market, suddenly, an immense amount of
cheap tea and so cause heavy losses to american merchants who had large
stocks on hand. it threatened with ruin the business of all those who
were engaged in clandestine trade with the dutch. it carried with it an
irritating tax of three pence on imports. in charleston, annapolis, new
york, and boston, captains of ships who brought tea under this act were
roughly handled. one night in december, 1773, a band of boston citizens,
disguised as indians, boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo
into the harbor. this was serious business, for it was open, flagrant,
determined violation of the law. as such the british government viewed
it.


retaliation by the british government

=reception of the news of the tea riot.=--the news of the tea riot in
boston confirmed king george in his conviction that there should be no
soft policy in dealing with his american subjects. "the die is cast," he
stated with evident satisfaction. "the colonies must either triumph or
submit.... if we take the resolute part, they will undoubtedly be very
meek." lord george germain characterized the tea party as "the
proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who ought, if they had
the least prudence, to follow their mercantile employments and not
trouble themselves with politics and government, which they do not
understand." this expressed, in concise form, exactly the sentiments of
lord north, who had then for three years been the king's chief minister.
even pitt, lord chatham, was prepared to support the government in
upholding its authority.

=the five intolerable acts.=--parliament, beginning on march 31, 1774,
passed five stringent measures, known in american history as the five
"intolerable acts." they were aimed at curing the unrest in america. the
_first_ of them was a bill absolutely shutting the port of boston to
commerce with the outside world. the _second_, following closely,
revoked the massachusetts charter of 1691 and provided furthermore that
the councilors should be appointed by the king, that all judges should
be named by the royal governor, and that town meetings (except to elect
certain officers) could not be held without the governor's consent. a
_third_ measure, after denouncing the "utter subversion of all lawful
government" in the provinces, authorized royal agents to transfer to
great britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other
persons accused of murder in connection with the enforcement of the law.
the _fourth_ act legalized the quartering of troops in massachusetts
towns. the _fifth_ of the measures was the quebec act, which granted
religious toleration to the catholics in canada, extended the boundaries
of quebec southward to the ohio river, and established, in this western
region, government by a viceroy.

the intolerable acts went through parliament with extraordinary
celerity. there was an opposition, alert and informed; but it was
ineffective. burke spoke eloquently against the boston port bill,
condemning it roundly for punishing the innocent with the guilty, and
showing how likely it was to bring grave consequences in its train. he
was heard with respect and his pleas were rejected. the bill passed both
houses without a division, the entry "unanimous" being made upon their
journals although it did not accurately represent the state of opinion.
the law destroying the charter of massachusetts passed the commons by a
vote of three to one; and the third intolerable act by a vote of four to
one. the triumph of the ministry was complete. "what passed in boston,"
exclaimed the great jurist, lord mansfield, "is the overt act of high
treason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresight." the
crown and parliament were united in resorting to punitive measures.

in the colonies the laws were received with consternation. to the
american protestants, the quebec act was the most offensive. that
project they viewed not as an act of grace or of mercy but as a direct
attempt to enlist french canadians on the side of great britain. the
british government did not grant religious toleration to catholics
either at home or in ireland and the americans could see no good motive
in granting it in north america. the act was also offensive because
massachusetts, connecticut, and virginia had, under their charters,
large claims in the territory thus annexed to quebec.

to enforce these intolerable acts the military arm of the british
government was brought into play. the commander-in-chief of the armed
forces in america, general gage, was appointed governor of
massachusetts. reinforcements were brought to the colonies, for now king
george was to give "the rebels," as he called them, a taste of strong
medicine. the majesty of his law was to be vindicated by force.


from reform to revolution in america

=the doctrine of natural rights.=--the dissolution of assemblies, the
destruction of charters, and the use of troops produced in the colonies
a new phase in the struggle. in the early days of the contest with the
british ministry, the americans spoke of their "rights as englishmen"
and condemned the acts of parliament as unlawful, as violating the
principles of the english constitution under which they all lived. when
they saw that such arguments had no effect on parliament, they turned
for support to their "natural rights." the latter doctrine, in the form
in which it was employed by the colonists, was as english as the
constitutional argument. john locke had used it with good effect in
defense of the english revolution in the seventeenth century. american
leaders, familiar with the writings of locke, also took up his thesis in
the hour of their distress. they openly declared that their rights did
not rest after all upon the english constitution or a charter from the
crown. "old magna carta was not the beginning of all things," retorted
otis when the constitutional argument failed. "a time may come when
parliament shall declare every american charter void, but the natural,
inherent, and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citizens
would remain and whatever became of charters can never be abolished
until the general conflagration." of the same opinion was the young and
impetuous alexander hamilton. "the sacred rights of mankind," he
exclaimed, "are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty
records. they are written as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human
destiny by the hand of divinity itself, and can never be erased or
obscured by mortal power."

firm as the american leaders were in the statement and defense of their
rights, there is every reason for believing that in the beginning they
hoped to confine the conflict to the realm of opinion. they constantly
avowed that they were loyal to the king when protesting in the strongest
language against his policies. even otis, regarded by the loyalists as a
firebrand, was in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning
concessions from england. "i argue this cause with the greater
pleasure," he solemnly urged in his speech against the writs of
assistance, "as it is in favor of british liberty ... and as it is in
opposition to a kind of power, the exercise of which in former periods
cost one king of england his head and another his throne."

=burke offers the doctrine of conciliation.=--the flooding tide of
american sentiment was correctly measured by one englishman at least,
edmund burke, who quickly saw that attempts to restrain the rise of
american democracy were efforts to reverse the processes of nature. he
saw how fixed and rooted in the nature of things was the american
spirit--how inevitable, how irresistible. he warned his countrymen that
there were three ways of handling the delicate situation--and only
three. one was to remove the cause of friction by changing the spirit of
the colonists--an utter impossibility because that spirit was grounded
in the essential circumstances of american life. the second was to
prosecute american leaders as criminals; of this he begged his
countrymen to beware lest the colonists declare that "a government
against which a claim of liberty is tantamount to high treason is a
government to which submission is equivalent to slavery." the third and
right way to meet the problem, burke concluded, was to accept the
american spirit, repeal the obnoxious measures, and receive the colonies
into equal partnership.

=events produce the great decision.=--the right way, indicated by burke,
was equally impossible to george iii and the majority in parliament. to
their narrow minds, american opinion was contemptible and american
resistance unlawful, riotous, and treasonable. the correct way, in their
view, was to dispatch more troops to crush the "rebels"; and that very
act took the contest from the realm of opinion. as john adams said:
"facts are stubborn things." opinions were unseen, but marching soldiers
were visible to the veriest street urchin. "now," said gouverneur
morris, "the sheep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore."
it was too late to talk about the excellence of the british
constitution. if any one is bewildered by the controversies of modern
historians as to why the crisis came at last, he can clarify his
understanding by reading again edmund burke's stately oration, _on
conciliation with america_.

chapter vi

the american revolution


resistance and retaliation

=the continental congress.=--when the news of the "intolerable acts"
reached america, every one knew what strong medicine parliament was
prepared to administer to all those who resisted its authority. the
cause of massachusetts became the cause of all the colonies. opposition
to british policy, hitherto local and spasmodic, now took on a national
character. to local committees and provincial conventions was added a
continental congress, appropriately called by massachusetts on june 17,
1774, at the instigation of samuel adams. the response to the summons
was electric. by hurried and irregular methods delegates were elected
during the summer, and on september 5 the congress duly assembled in
carpenter's hall in philadelphia. many of the greatest men in america
were there--george washington and patrick henry from virginia and john
and samuel adams from massachusetts. every shade of opinion was
represented. some were impatient with mild devices; the majority favored
moderation.

the congress drew up a declaration of american rights and stated in
clear and dignified language the grievances of the colonists. it
approved the resistance to british measures offered by massachusetts and
promised the united support of all sections. it prepared an address to
king george and another to the people of england, disavowing the idea of
independence but firmly attacking the policies pursued by the british
government.

=the non-importation agreement.=--the congress was not content, however,
with professions of faith and with petitions. it took one revolutionary
step. it agreed to stop the importation of british goods into america,
and the enforcement of this agreement it placed in the hands of local
"committees of safety and inspection," to be elected by the qualified
voters. the significance of this action is obvious. congress threw
itself athwart british law. it made a rule to bind american citizens and
to be carried into effect by american officers. it set up a state within
the british state and laid down a test of allegiance to the new order.
the colonists, who up to this moment had been wavering, had to choose
one authority or the other. they were for the enforcement of the
non-importation agreement or they were against it. they either bought
english goods or they did not. in the spirit of the toast--"may britain
be wise and america be free"--the first continental congress adjourned
in october, having appointed the tenth of may following for the meeting
of a second congress, should necessity require.

=lord north's "olive branch."=--when the news of the action of the
american congress reached england, pitt and burke warmly urged a repeal
of the obnoxious laws, but in vain. all they could wring from the prime
minister, lord north, was a set of "conciliatory resolutions" proposing
to relieve from taxation any colony that would assume its share of
imperial defense and make provision for supporting the local officers of
the crown. this "olive branch" was accompanied by a resolution assuring
the king of support at all hazards in suppressing the rebellion and by
the restraining act of march 30, 1775, which in effect destroyed the
commerce of new england.

=bloodshed at lexington and concord (april 19, 1775).=--meanwhile the
british authorities in massachusetts relaxed none of their efforts in
upholding british sovereignty. general gage, hearing that military
stores had been collected at concord, dispatched a small force to seize
them. by this act he precipitated the conflict he had sought to avoid.
at lexington, on the road to concord, occurred "the little thing" that
produced "the great event." an unexpected collision beyond the thought
or purpose of any man had transferred the contest from the forum to the
battle field.

=the second continental congress.=--though blood had been shed and war
was actually at hand, the second continental congress, which met at
philadelphia in may, 1775, was not yet convinced that conciliation was
beyond human power. it petitioned the king to interpose on behalf of the
colonists in order that the empire might avoid the calamities of civil
war. on the last day of july, it made a temperate but firm answer to
lord north's offer of conciliation, stating that the proposal was
unsatisfactory because it did not renounce the right to tax or repeal
the offensive acts of parliament.

=force, the british answer.=--just as the representatives of america
were about to present the last petition of congress to the king on
august 23, 1775, george iii issued a proclamation of rebellion. this
announcement declared that the colonists, "misled by dangerous and
ill-designing men," were in a state of insurrection; it called on the
civil and military powers to bring "the traitors to justice"; and it
threatened with "condign punishment the authors, perpetrators, and
abettors of such traitorous designs." it closed with the usual prayer:
"god, save the king." later in the year, parliament passed a sweeping
act destroying all trade and intercourse with america. congress was
silent at last. force was also america's answer.


american independence

=drifting into war.=--although the congress had not given up all hope of
reconciliation in the spring and summer of 1775, it had firmly resolved
to defend american rights by arms if necessary. it transformed the
militiamen who had assembled near boston, after the battle of lexington,
into a continental army and selected washington as commander-in-chief.
it assumed the powers of a government and prepared to raise money, wage
war, and carry on diplomatic relations with foreign countries.

[illustration: _from an old print_

spirit of 1776]

events followed thick and fast. on june 17, the american militia, by
the stubborn defense of bunker hill, showed that it could make british
regulars pay dearly for all they got. on july 3, washington took command
of the army at cambridge. in january, 1776, after bitter disappointments
in drumming up recruits for its army in england, scotland, and ireland,
the british government concluded a treaty with the landgrave of
hesse-cassel in germany contracting, at a handsome figure, for thousands
of soldiers and many pieces of cannon. this was the crowning insult to
america. such was the view of all friends of the colonies on both sides
of the water. such was, long afterward, the judgment of the conservative
historian lecky: "the conduct of england in hiring german mercenaries to
subdue the essentially english population beyond the atlantic made
reconciliation hopeless and independence inevitable." the news of this
wretched transaction in german soldiers had hardly reached america
before there ran all down the coast the thrilling story that washington
had taken boston, on march 17, 1776, compelling lord howe to sail with
his entire army for halifax.

=the growth of public sentiment in favor of independence.=--events were
bearing the americans away from their old position under the british
constitution toward a final separation. slowly and against their
desires, prudent and honorable men, who cherished the ties that united
them to the old order and dreaded with genuine horror all thought of
revolution, were drawn into the path that led to the great decision. in
all parts of the country and among all classes, the question of the hour
was being debated. "american independence," as the historian bancroft
says, "was not an act of sudden passion nor the work of one man or one
assembly. it had been discussed in every part of the country by farmers
and merchants, by mechanics and planters, by the fishermen along the
coast and the backwoodsmen of the west; in town meetings and from the
pulpit; at social gatherings and around the camp fires; in county
conventions and conferences or committees; in colonial congresses and
assemblies."

thomas paine]

=paine's "commonsense."=--in the midst of this ferment of american
opinion, a bold and eloquent pamphleteer broke in upon the hesitating
public with a program for absolute independence, without fears and
without apologies. in the early days of 1776, thomas paine issued the
first of his famous tracts, "commonsense," a passionate attack upon the
british monarchy and an equally passionate plea for american liberty.
casting aside the language of petition with which americans had hitherto
addressed george iii, paine went to the other extreme and assailed him
with many a violent epithet. he condemned monarchy itself as a system
which had laid the world "in blood and ashes." instead of praising the
british constitution under which colonists had been claiming their
rights, he brushed it aside as ridiculous, protesting that it was "owing
to the constitution of the people, not to the constitution of the
government, that the crown is not as oppressive in england as in
turkey."

having thus summarily swept away the grounds of allegiance to the old
order, paine proceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate
separation from great britain. there was nothing in the sphere of
practical interest, he insisted, which should bind the colonies to the
mother country. allegiance to her had been responsible for the many wars
in which they had been involved. reasons of trade were not less weighty
in behalf of independence. "our corn will fetch its price in any market
in europe and our imported goods must be paid for, buy them where we
will." as to matters of government, "it is not in the power of britain
to do this continent justice; the business of it will soon be too
weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of
convenience by a power so distant from us and so very ignorant of us."

there is accordingly no alternative to independence for america.
"everything that is right or natural pleads for separation. the blood of
the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries ''tis time to part.' ...
arms, the last resort, must decide the contest; the appeal was the
choice of the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge.... the
sun never shone on a cause of greater worth. 'tis not the affair of a
city, a county, a province or a kingdom, but of a continent.... 'tis not
the concern of a day, a year or an age; posterity is involved in the
contest and will be more or less affected to the end of time by the
proceedings now. now is the seed-time of continental union, faith, and
honor.... o! ye that love mankind! ye that dare oppose not only the
tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth.... let names of whig and tory be
extinct. let none other be heard among us than those of a good citizen,
an open and resolute friend, and a virtuous supporter of the rights of
mankind and of the free and independent states of america." as more than
100,000 copies were scattered broadcast over the country, patriots
exclaimed with washington: "sound doctrine and unanswerable reason!"

=the drift of events toward independence.=--official support for the
idea of independence began to come from many quarters. on the tenth of
february, 1776, gadsden, in the provincial convention of south carolina,
advocated a new constitution for the colony and absolute independence
for all america. the convention balked at the latter but went half way
by abolishing the system of royal administration and establishing a
complete plan of self-government. a month later, on april 12, the
neighboring state of north carolina uttered the daring phrase from which
others shrank. it empowered its representatives in the congress to
concur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring
independence. rhode island, massachusetts, and virginia quickly
responded to the challenge. the convention of the old dominion, on may
15, instructed its delegates at philadelphia to propose the independence
of the united colonies and to give the assent of virginia to the act of
separation. when the resolution was carried the british flag on the
state house was lowered for all time.

meanwhile the continental congress was alive to the course of events
outside. the subject of independence was constantly being raised. "are
we rebels?" exclaimed wyeth of virginia during a debate in february.
"no: we must declare ourselves a free people." others hesitated and
spoke of waiting for the arrival of commissioners of conciliation. "is
not america already independent?" asked samuel adams a few weeks later.
"why not then declare it?" still there was uncertainty and delegates
avoided the direct word. a few more weeks elapsed. at last, on may 10,
congress declared that the authority of the british crown in america
must be suppressed and advised the colonies to set up governments of
their own.

thomas jefferson reading his draft of the declaration of
independence to the committee of congress]

=independence declared.=--the way was fully prepared, therefore, when,
on june 7, the virginia delegation in the congress moved that "these
united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent
states." a committee was immediately appointed to draft a formal
document setting forth the reasons for the act, and on july 2 all the
states save new york went on record in favor of severing their political
connection with great britain. two days later, july 4, jefferson's draft
of the declaration of independence, changed in some slight particulars,
was adopted. the old bell in independence hall, as it is now known, rang
out the glad tidings; couriers swiftly carried the news to the uttermost
hamlet and farm. a new nation announced its will to have a place among
the powers of the world.

to some documents is given immortality. the declaration of independence
is one of them. american patriotism is forever associated with it; but
patriotism alone does not make it immortal. neither does the vigor of
its language or the severity of its indictment give it a secure place in
the records of time. the secret of its greatness lies in the simple fact
that it is one of the memorable landmarks in the history of a political
ideal which for three centuries has been taking form and spreading
throughout the earth, challenging kings and potentates, shaking down
thrones and aristocracies, breaking the armies of irresponsible power on
battle fields as far apart as marston moor and chateau-thierry. that
ideal, now so familiar, then so novel, is summed up in the simple
sentence: "governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
governed."

written in a "decent respect for the opinions of mankind," to set forth
the causes which impelled the american colonists to separate from
britain, the declaration contained a long list of "abuses and
usurpations" which had induced them to throw off the government of king
george. that section of the declaration has passed into "ancient"
history and is seldom read. it is the part laying down a new basis for
government and giving a new dignity to the common man that has become a
household phrase in the old world as in the new.

in the more enduring passages there are four fundamental ideas which,
from the standpoint of the old system of government, were the essence of
revolution: (1) all men are created equal and are endowed by their
creator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness; (2) the purpose of government is to secure these
rights; (3) governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
governed; (4) whenever any form of government becomes destructive of
these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and
institute new government, laying its foundations on such principles and
organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to
effect their safety and happiness. here was the prelude to the historic
drama of democracy--a challenge to every form of government and every
privilege not founded on popular assent.


the establishment of government and the new allegiance

=the committees of correspondence.=--as soon as debate had passed into
armed resistance, the patriots found it necessary to consolidate their
forces by organizing civil government. this was readily effected, for
the means were at hand in town meetings, provincial legislatures, and
committees of correspondence. the working tools of the revolution were
in fact the committees of correspondence--small, local, unofficial
groups of patriots formed to exchange views and create public sentiment.
as early as november, 1772, such a committee had been created in boston
under the leadership of samuel adams. it held regular meetings, sent
emissaries to neighboring towns, and carried on a campaign of education
in the doctrines of liberty.

[illustration: the colonies of north america at the time of the
declaration of independence]

upon local organizations similar in character to the boston committee
were built county committees and then the larger colonial committees,
congresses, and conventions, all unofficial and representing the
revolutionary elements. ordinarily the provincial convention was merely
the old legislative assembly freed from all royalist sympathizers and
controlled by patriots. finally, upon these colonial assemblies was
built the continental congress, the precursor of union under the
articles of confederation and ultimately under the constitution of the
united states. this was the revolutionary government set up within the
british empire in america.

=state constitutions framed.=--with the rise of these new assemblies of
the people, the old colonial governments broke down. from the royal
provinces the governor, the judges, and the high officers fled in haste,
and it became necessary to substitute patriot authorities. the appeal to
the colonies advising them to adopt a new form of government for
themselves, issued by the congress in may, 1776, was quickly acted upon.
before the expiration of a year, virginia, new jersey, pennsylvania,
delaware, maryland, georgia, and new york had drafted new constitutions
as states, not as colonies uncertain of their destinies. connecticut and
rhode island, holding that their ancient charters were equal to their
needs, merely renounced their allegiance to the king and went on as
before so far as the form of government was concerned. south carolina,
which had drafted a temporary plan early in 1776, drew up a new and more
complete constitution in 1778. two years later massachusetts with much
deliberation put into force its fundamental law, which in most of its
essential features remains unchanged to-day.

the new state constitutions in their broad outlines followed colonial
models. for the royal governor was substituted a governor or president
chosen usually by the legislature; but in two instances, new york and
massachusetts, by popular vote. for the provincial council there was
substituted, except in georgia, a senate; while the lower house, or
assembly, was continued virtually without change. the old property
restriction on the suffrage, though lowered slightly in some states, was
continued in full force to the great discontent of the mechanics thus
deprived of the ballot. the special qualifications, laid down in several
constitutions, for governors, senators, and representatives, indicated
that the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any radical
experiments in democracy. the protests of a few women, like mrs. john
adams of massachusetts and mrs. henry corbin of virginia, against a
government which excluded them from political rights were treated as
mild curiosities of no significance, although in new jersey women were
allowed to vote for many years on the same terms as men.

by the new state constitutions the signs and symbols of royal power, of
authority derived from any source save "the people," were swept aside
and republican governments on an imposing scale presented for the first
time to the modern world. copies of these remarkable documents prepared
by plain citizens were translated into french and widely circulated in
europe. there they were destined to serve as a guide and inspiration to
a generation of constitution-makers whose mission it was to begin the
democratic revolution in the old world.

=the articles of confederation.=--the formation of state constitutions
was an easy task for the revolutionary leaders. they had only to build
on foundations already laid. the establishment of a national system of
government was another matter. there had always been, it must be
remembered, a system of central control over the colonies, but americans
had had little experience in its operation. when the supervision of the
crown of great britain was suddenly broken, the patriot leaders,
accustomed merely to provincial statesmanship, were poorly trained for
action on a national stage.

many forces worked against those who, like franklin, had a vision of
national destiny. there were differences in economic interest--commerce
and industry in the north and the planting system of the south. there
were contests over the apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops
for common defense. to these practical difficulties were added local
pride, the vested rights of state and village politicians in their
provincial dignity, and the scarcity of men with a large outlook upon
the common enterprise.

nevertheless, necessity compelled them to consider some sort of
federation. the second continental congress had hardly opened its work
before the most sagacious leaders began to urge the desirability of a
permanent connection. as early as july, 1775, congress resolved to go
into a committee of the whole on the state of the union, and franklin,
undaunted by the fate of his albany plan of twenty years before, again
presented a draft of a constitution. long and desultory debates followed
and it was not until late in 1777 that congress presented to the states
the articles of confederation. provincial jealousies delayed
ratification, and it was the spring of 1781, a few months before the
surrender of cornwallis at yorktown, when maryland, the last of the
states, approved the articles. this plan of union, though it was all
that could be wrung from the reluctant states, provided for neither a
chief executive nor a system of federal courts. it created simply a
congress of delegates in which each state had an equal voice and gave it
the right to call upon the state legislatures for the sinews of
government--money and soldiers.

=the application of tests of allegiance.=--as the successive steps were
taken in the direction of independent government, the patriots devised
and applied tests designed to discover who were for and who were against
the new nation in the process of making. when the first continental
congress agreed not to allow the importation of british goods, it
provided for the creation of local committees to enforce the rules. such
agencies were duly formed by the choice of men favoring the scheme, all
opponents being excluded from the elections. before these bodies those
who persisted in buying british goods were summoned and warned or
punished according to circumstances. as soon as the new state
constitutions were put into effect, local committees set to work in the
same way to ferret out all who were not outspoken in their support of
the new order of things.

[illustration: mobbing the tories]

these patriot agencies, bearing different names in different sections,
were sometimes ruthless in their methods. they called upon all men to
sign the test of loyalty, frequently known as the "association test."
those who refused were promptly branded as outlaws, while some of the
more dangerous were thrown into jail. the prison camp in connecticut at
one time held the former governor of new jersey and the mayor of new
york. thousands were black-listed and subjected to espionage. the
black-list of pennsylvania contained the names of nearly five hundred
persons of prominence who were under suspicion. loyalists or tories who
were bold enough to speak and write against the revolution were
suppressed and their pamphlets burned. in many places, particularly in
the north, the property of the loyalists was confiscated and the
proceeds applied to the cause of the revolution.

the work of the official agencies for suppression of opposition was
sometimes supplemented by mob violence. a few tories were hanged without
trial, and others were tarred and feathered. one was placed upon a cake
of ice and held there "until his loyalty to king george might cool."
whole families were driven out of their homes to find their way as best
they could within the british lines or into canada, where the british
government gave them lands. such excesses were deplored by washington,
but they were defended on the ground that in effect a civil war, as well
as a war for independence, was being waged.

=the patriots and tories.=--thus, by one process or another, those who
were to be citizens of the new republic were separated from those who
preferred to be subjects of king george. just what proportion of the
americans favored independence and what share remained loyal to the
british monarchy there is no way of knowing. the question of revolution
was not submitted to popular vote, and on the point of numbers we have
conflicting evidence. on the patriot side, there is the testimony of a
careful and informed observer, john adams, who asserted that two-thirds
of the people were for the american cause and not more than one-third
opposed the revolution at all stages.

on behalf of the loyalists, or tories as they were popularly known,
extravagant claims were made. joseph galloway, who had been a member of
the first continental congress and had fled to england when he saw its
temper, testified before a committee of parliament in 1779 that not
one-fifth of the american people supported the insurrection and that
"many more than four-fifths of the people prefer a union with great
britain upon constitutional principles to independence." at the same
time general robertson, who had lived in america twenty-four years,
declared that "more than two-thirds of the people would prefer the
king's government to the congress' tyranny." in an address to the king
in that year a committee of american loyalists asserted that "the number
of americans in his majesty's army exceeded the number of troops
enlisted by congress to oppose them."

=the character of the loyalists.=--when general howe evacuated boston,
more than a thousand people fled with him. this great company, according
to a careful historian, "formed the aristocracy of the province by
virtue of their official rank; of their dignified callings and
professions; of their hereditary wealth and of their culture." the act
of banishment passed by massachusetts in 1778, listing over 300 tories,
"reads like the social register of the oldest and noblest families of
new england," more than one out of five being graduates of harvard
college. the same was true of new york and philadelphia; namely, that
the leading loyalists were prominent officials of the old order,
clergymen and wealthy merchants. with passion the loyalists fought
against the inevitable or with anguish of heart they left as refugees
for a life of uncertainty in canada or the mother country.

=tories assail the patriots.=--the tories who remained in america joined
the british army by the thousands or in other ways aided the royal
cause. those who were skillful with the pen assailed the patriots in
editorials, rhymes, satires, and political catechisms. they declared
that the members of congress were "obscure, pettifogging attorneys,
bankrupt shopkeepers, outlawed smugglers, etc." the people and their
leaders they characterized as "wretched banditti ... the refuse and
dregs of mankind." the generals in the army they sneered at as "men of
rank and honor nearly on a par with those of the congress."

=patriot writers arouse the national spirit.=--stung by tory taunts,
patriot writers devoted themselves to creating and sustaining a public
opinion favorable to the american cause. moreover, they had to combat
the depression that grew out of the misfortunes in the early days of the
war. a terrible disaster befell generals arnold and montgomery in the
winter of 1775 as they attempted to bring canada into the revolution--a
disaster that cost 5000 men; repeated calamities harassed washington in
1776 as he was defeated on long island, driven out of new york city, and
beaten at harlem heights and white plains. these reverses were almost
too great for the stoutest patriots.

pamphleteers, preachers, and publicists rose, however, to meet the needs
of the hour. john witherspoon, provost of the college of new jersey,
forsook the classroom for the field of political controversy. the poet,
philip freneau, flung taunts of cowardice at the tories and celebrated
the spirit of liberty in many a stirring poem. songs, ballads, plays,
and satires flowed from the press in an unending stream. fast days,
battle anniversaries, celebrations of important steps taken by congress
afforded to patriotic clergymen abundant opportunities for sermons.
"does mr. wiberd preach against oppression?" anxiously inquired john
adams in a letter to his wife. the answer was decisive. "the clergy of
every denomination, not excepting the episcopalian, thunder and lighten
every sabbath. they pray for boston and massachusetts. they thank god
most explicitly and fervently for our remarkable successes. they pray
for the american army."

thomas paine never let his pen rest. he had been with the forces of
washington when they retreated from fort lee and were harried from new
jersey into pennsylvania. he knew the effect of such reverses on the
army as well as on the public. in december, 1776, he made a second great
appeal to his countrymen in his pamphlet, "the crisis," the first part
of which he had written while defeat and gloom were all about him. this
tract was a cry for continued support of the revolution. "these are the
times that try men's souls," he opened. "the summer soldier and the
sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his
country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men
and women." paine laid his lash fiercely on the tories, branding every
one as a coward grounded in "servile, slavish, self-interested fear." he
deplored the inadequacy of the militia and called for a real army. he
refuted the charge that the retreat through new jersey was a disaster
and he promised victory soon. "by perseverance and fortitude," he
concluded, "we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and
submission the sad choice of a variety of evils--a ravaged country, a
depopulated city, habitations without safety and slavery without
hope.... look on this picture and weep over it." his ringing call to
arms was followed by another and another until the long contest was
over.


military affairs

=the two phases of the war.=--the war which opened with the battle of
lexington, on april 19, 1775, and closed with the surrender of
cornwallis at yorktown on october 19, 1781, passed through two distinct
phases--the first lasting until the treaty of alliance with france, in
1778, and the second until the end of the struggle. during the first
phase, the war was confined mainly to the north. the outstanding
features of the contest were the evacuation of boston by the british,
the expulsion of american forces from new york and their retreat through
new jersey, the battle of trenton, the seizure of philadelphia by the
british (september, 1777), the invasion of new york by burgoyne and his
capture at saratoga in october, 1777, and the encampment of american
forces at valley forge for the terrible winter of 1777-78.

the final phase of the war, opening with the treaty of alliance with
france on february 6, 1778, was confined mainly to the middle states,
the west, and the south. in the first sphere of action the chief events
were the withdrawal of the british from philadelphia, the battle of
monmouth, and the inclosure of the british in new york by deploying
american forces from morristown, new jersey, up to west point. in the
west, george rogers clark, by his famous march into the illinois
country, secured kaskaskia and vincennes and laid a firm grip on the
country between the ohio and the great lakes. in the south, the second
period opened with successes for the british. they captured savannah,
conquered georgia, and restored the royal governor. in 1780 they seized
charleston, administered a crushing defeat to the american forces under
gates at camden, and overran south carolina, though meeting reverses at
cowpens and king's mountain. then came the closing scenes. cornwallis
began the last of his operations. he pursued general greene far into
north carolina, clashed with him at guilford court house, retired to the
coast, took charge of british forces engaged in plundering virginia, and
fortified yorktown, where he was penned up by the french fleet from the
sea and the combined french and american forces on land.

=the geographical aspects of the war.=--for the british the theater of
the war offered many problems. from first to last it extended from
massachusetts to georgia, a distance of almost a thousand miles. it was
nearly three thousand miles from the main base of supplies and, though
the british navy kept the channel open, transports were constantly
falling prey to daring privateers and fleet american war vessels. the
sea, on the other hand, offered an easy means of transportation between
points along the coast and gave ready access to the american centers of
wealth and population. of this the british made good use. though early
forced to give up boston, they seized new york and kept it until the end
of the war; they took philadelphia and retained it until threatened by
the approach of the french fleet; and they captured and held both
savannah and charleston. wars, however, are seldom won by the conquest
of cities.

particularly was this true in the case of the revolution. only a small
portion of the american people lived in towns. countrymen back from the
coast were in no way dependent upon them for a livelihood. they lived on
the produce of the soil, not upon the profits of trade. this very fact
gave strength to them in the contest. whenever the british ventured far
from the ports of entry, they encountered reverses. burgoyne was forced
to surrender at saratoga because he was surrounded and cut off from his
base of supplies. as soon as the british got away from charleston, they
were harassed and worried by the guerrilla warriors of marion, sumter,
and pickens. cornwallis could technically defeat greene at guilford far
in the interior; but he could not hold the inland region he had invaded.
sustained by their own labor, possessing the interior to which their
armies could readily retreat, supplied mainly from native resources, the
americans could not be hemmed in, penned up, and destroyed at one fell
blow.

=the sea power.=--the british made good use of their fleet in cutting
off american trade, but control of the sea did not seriously affect the
united states. as an agricultural country, the ruin of its commerce was
not such a vital matter. all the materials for a comfortable though
somewhat rude life were right at hand. it made little difference to a
nation fighting for existence, if silks, fine linens, and chinaware were
cut off. this was an evil to which submission was necessary.

nor did the brilliant exploits of john paul jones and captain john barry
materially change the situation. they demonstrated the skill of american
seamen and their courage as fighting men. they raised the rates of
british marine insurance, but they did not dethrone the mistress of the
seas. less spectacular, and more distinctive, were the deeds of the
hundreds of privateers and minor captains who overhauled british supply
ships and kept british merchantmen in constant anxiety. not until the
french fleet was thrown into the scale, were the british compelled to
reckon seriously with the enemy on the sea and make plans based upon the
possibilities of a maritime disaster.

=commanding officers.=--on the score of military leadership it is
difficult to compare the contending forces in the revolutionary contest.
there is no doubt that all the british commanders were men of experience
in the art of warfare. sir william howe had served in america during the
french war and was accounted an excellent officer, a strict
disciplinarian, and a gallant gentleman. nevertheless he loved ease,
society, and good living, and his expulsion from boston, his failure to
overwhelm washington by sallies from his comfortable bases at new york
and philadelphia, destroyed every shred of his military reputation. john
burgoyne, to whom was given the task of penetrating new york from
canada, had likewise seen service in the french war both in america and
europe. he had, however, a touch of the theatrical in his nature and
after the collapse of his plans and the surrender of his army in 1777,
he devoted his time mainly to light literature. sir henry clinton, who
directed the movement which ended in the capture of charleston in 1780,
had "learned his trade on the continent," and was regarded as a man of
discretion and understanding in military matters. lord cornwallis, whose
achievements at camden and guilford were blotted out by his surrender at
yorktown, had seen service in the seven years' war and had undoubted
talents which he afterward displayed with great credit to himself in
india. though none of them, perhaps, were men of first-rate ability,
they all had training and experience to guide them.

[illustration: george washington]

the americans had a host in washington himself. he had long been
interested in military strategy and had tested his coolness under fire
during the first clashes with the french nearly twenty years before. he
had no doubts about the justice of his cause, such as plagued some of
the british generals. he was a stern but reasonable disciplinarian. he
was reserved and patient, little given to exaltation at success or
depression at reverses. in the dark hour of the revolution, "what held
the patriot forces together?" asks beveridge in his _life of john
marshall_. then he answers: "george washington and he alone. had he
died or been seriously disabled, the revolution would have ended....
washington was the soul of the american cause. washington was the
government. washington was the revolution." the weakness of congress in
furnishing men and supplies, the indolence of civilians, who lived at
ease while the army starved, the intrigues of army officers against him
such as the "conway cabal," the cowardice of lee at monmouth, even the
treason of benedict arnold, while they stirred deep emotions in his
breast and aroused him to make passionate pleas to his countrymen, did
not shake his iron will or his firm determination to see the war through
to the bitter end. the weight of washington's moral force was
immeasurable.

of the generals who served under him, none can really be said to have
been experienced military men when the war opened. benedict arnold, the
unhappy traitor but brave and daring soldier, was a druggist, book
seller, and ship owner at new haven when the news of lexington called
him to battle. horatio gates was looked upon as a "seasoned soldier"
because he had entered the british army as a youth, had been wounded at
braddock's memorable defeat, and had served with credit during the seven
years' war; but he was the most conspicuous failure of the revolution.
the triumph over burgoyne was the work of other men; and his crushing
defeat at camden put an end to his military pretensions. nathanael
greene was a rhode island farmer and smith without military experience
who, when convinced that war was coming, read caesar's _commentaries_ and
took up the sword. francis marion was a shy and modest planter of south
carolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief but desperate brush
with the indians ten or twelve years earlier. daniel morgan, one of the
heroes of cowpens, had been a teamster with braddock's army and had seen
some fighting during the french and indian war, but his military
knowledge, from the point of view of a trained british officer, was
negligible. john sullivan was a successful lawyer at durham, new
hampshire, and a major in the local militia when duty summoned him to
lay down his briefs and take up the sword. anthony wayne was a
pennsylvania farmer and land surveyor who, on hearing the clash of arms,
read a few books on war, raised a regiment, and offered himself for
service. such is the story of the chief american military leaders, and
it is typical of them all. some had seen fighting with the french and
indians, but none of them had seen warfare on a large scale with regular
troops commanded according to the strategy evolved in european
experience. courage, native ability, quickness of mind, and knowledge of
the country they had in abundance, and in battles such as were fought
during the revolution all those qualities counted heavily in the
balance.

=foreign officers in american service.=--to native genius was added
military talent from beyond the seas. baron steuben, well schooled in
the iron regime of frederick the great, came over from prussia, joined
washington at valley forge, and day after day drilled and manoeuvered the
men, laughing and cursing as he turned raw countrymen into regular
soldiers. from france came young lafayette and the stern de kalb, from
poland came pulaski and kosciusko;--all acquainted with the arts of war
as waged in europe and fitted for leadership as well as teaching.
lafayette came early, in 1776, in a ship of his own, accompanied by
several officers of wide experience, and remained loyally throughout the
war sharing the hardships of american army life. pulaski fell at the
siege of savannah and de kalb at camden. kosciusko survived the american
war to defend in vain the independence of his native land. to these
distinguished foreigners, who freely threw in their lot with american
revolutionary fortunes, was due much of that spirit and discipline which
fitted raw recruits and temperamental militiamen to cope with a military
power of the first rank.

=the soldiers.=--as far as the british soldiers were concerned their
annals are short and simple. the regulars from the standing army who
were sent over at the opening of the contest, the recruits drummed up
by special efforts at home, and the thousands of hessians bought
outright by king george presented few problems of management to the
british officers. these common soldiers were far away from home and
enlisted for the war. nearly all of them were well disciplined and many
of them experienced in actual campaigns. the armies of king george
fought bravely, as the records of bunker hill, brandywine, and monmouth
demonstrate. many a man and subordinate officer and, for that matter,
some of the high officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against
their own kin; but they obeyed orders.

the americans, on the other hand, while they fought with grim
determination, as men fighting for their homes, were lacking in
discipline and in the experience of regular troops. when the war broke
in upon them, there were no common preparations for it. there was no
continental army; there were only local bands of militiamen, many of
them experienced in fighting but few of them "regulars" in the military
sense. moreover they were volunteers serving for a short time,
unaccustomed to severe discipline, and impatient at the restraints
imposed on them by long and arduous campaigns. they were continually
leaving the service just at the most critical moments. "the militia,"
lamented washington, "come in, you cannot tell how; go, you cannot tell
where; consume your provisions; exhaust your stores; and leave you at
last at a critical moment."

again and again washington begged congress to provide for an army of
regulars enlisted for the war, thoroughly trained and paid according to
some definite plan. at last he was able to overcome, in part at least,
the chronic fear of civilians in congress and to wring from that
reluctant body an agreement to grant half pay to all officers and a
bonus to all privates who served until the end of the war. even this
scheme, which washington regarded as far short of justice to the
soldiers, did not produce quick results. it was near the close of the
conflict before he had an army of well-disciplined veterans capable of
meeting british regulars on equal terms.

though there were times when militiamen and frontiersmen did valiant and
effective work, it is due to historical accuracy to deny the
time-honored tradition that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous
forces of regulars in a seven years' war for independence. they did
nothing of the sort. for the victories of bennington, trenton, saratoga,
and yorktown there were the defeats of bunker hill, long island, white
plains, germantown, and camden. not once did an army of militiamen
overcome an equal number of british regulars in an open trial by battle.
"to bring men to be well acquainted with the duties of a soldier," wrote
washington, "requires time.... to expect the same service from raw and
undisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never
did and perhaps never will happen."

=how the war was won.=--then how did the american army win the war? for
one thing there were delays and blunders on the part of the british
generals who, in 1775 and 1776, dallied in boston and new york with
large bodies of regular troops when they might have been dealing
paralyzing blows at the scattered bands that constituted the american
army. "nothing but the supineness or folly of the enemy could have saved
us," solemnly averred washington in 1780. still it is fair to say that
this apparent supineness was not all due to the british generals. the
ministers behind them believed that a large part of the colonists were
loyal and that compromise would be promoted by inaction rather than by a
war vigorously prosecuted. victory by masterly inactivity was obviously
better than conquest, and the slighter the wounds the quicker the
healing. later in the conflict when the seasoned forces of france were
thrown into the scale, the americans themselves had learned many things
about the practical conduct of campaigns. all along, the british were
embarrassed by the problem of supplies. their troops could not forage
with the skill of militiamen, as they were in unfamiliar territory. the
long oversea voyages were uncertain at best and doubly so when the
warships of france joined the american privateers in preying on supply
boats.

the british were in fact battered and worn down by a guerrilla war and
outdone on two important occasions by superior forces--at saratoga and
yorktown. stern facts convinced them finally that an immense army, which
could be raised only by a supreme effort, would be necessary to subdue
the colonies if that hazardous enterprise could be accomplished at all.
they learned also that america would then be alienated, fretful, and the
scene of endless uprisings calling for an army of occupation. that was a
price which staggered even lord north and george iii. moreover, there
were forces of opposition at home with which they had to reckon.

=women and the war.=--at no time were the women of america indifferent
to the struggle for independence. when it was confined to the realm of
opinion they did their part in creating public sentiment. mrs. elizabeth
timothee, for example, founded in charleston, in 1773, a newspaper to
espouse the cause of the province. far to the north the sister of james
otis, mrs. mercy warren, early begged her countrymen to rest their case
upon their natural rights, and in influential circles she urged the
leaders to stand fast by their principles. while john adams was tossing
about with uncertainty at the continental congress, his wife was writing
letters to him declaring her faith in "independency."

when the war came down upon the country, women helped in every field. in
sustaining public sentiment they were active. mrs. warren with a
tireless pen combatted loyalist propaganda in many a drama and satire.
almost every revolutionary leader had a wife or daughter who rendered
service in the "second line of defense." mrs. washington managed the
plantation while the general was at the front and went north to face the
rigors of the awful winter at valley forge--an inspiration to her
husband and his men. the daughter of benjamin franklin, mrs. sarah
bache, while her father was pleading the american cause in france, set
the women of pennsylvania to work sewing and collecting supplies. even
near the firing line women were to be found, aiding the wounded, hauling
powder to the front, and carrying dispatches at the peril of their
lives.

in the economic sphere, the work of women was invaluable. they harvested
crops without enjoying the picturesque title of "farmerettes" and they
canned and preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of war. of their
labor in spinning and weaving it is recorded: "immediately on being cut
off from the use of english manufactures, the women engaged within their
own families in manufacturing various kinds of cloth for domestic use.
they thus kept their households decently clad and the surplus of their
labors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than make for
themselves. in this way the female part of families by their industry
and strict economy frequently supported the whole domestic circle,
evincing the strength of their attachment and the value of their
service."

for their war work, women were commended by high authorities on more
than one occasion. they were given medals and public testimonials even
as in our own day. washington thanked them for their labors and paid
tribute to them for the inspiration and material aid which they had
given to the cause of independence.


the finances of the revolution

when the revolution opened, there were thirteen little treasuries in
america but no common treasury, and from first to last the congress was
in the position of a beggar rather than a sovereign. having no authority
to lay and collect taxes directly and knowing the hatred of the
provincials for taxation, it resorted mainly to loans and paper money to
finance the war. "do you think," boldly inquired one of the delegates,
"that i will consent to load my constituents with taxes when we can send
to the printer and get a wagon load of money, one quire of which will
pay for the whole?"

=paper money and loans.=--acting on this curious but appealing political
economy, congress issued in june, 1776, two million dollars in bills of
credit to be redeemed by the states on the basis of their respective
populations. other issues followed in quick succession. in all about
$241,000,000 of continental paper was printed, to which the several
states added nearly $210,000,000 of their own notes. then came
interest-bearing bonds in ever increasing quantities. several millions
were also borrowed from france and small sums from holland and spain. in
desperation a national lottery was held, producing meager results. the
property of tories was confiscated and sold, bringing in about
$16,000,000. begging letters were sent to the states asking them to
raise revenues for the continental treasury, but the states, burdened
with their own affairs, gave little heed.

=inflation and depreciation.=--as paper money flowed from the press, it
rapidly declined in purchasing power until in 1779 a dollar was worth
only two or three cents in gold or silver. attempts were made by
congress and the states to compel people to accept the notes at face
value; but these were like attempts to make water flow uphill.
speculators collected at once to fatten on the calamities of the
republic. fortunes were made and lost gambling on the prices of public
securities while the patriot army, half clothed, was freezing at valley
forge. "speculation, peculation, engrossing, forestalling," exclaimed
washington, "afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of public
virtue. nothing, i am convinced, but the depreciation of our currency
... aided by stock jobbing and party dissensions has fed the hopes of
the enemy."

=the patriot financiers.=--to the efforts of congress in financing the
war were added the labors of private citizens. hayn solomon, a merchant
of philadelphia, supplied members of congress, including madison,
jefferson, and monroe, and army officers, like lee and steuben, with
money for their daily needs. all together he contributed the huge sum of
half a million dollars to the american cause and died broken in purse,
if not in spirit, a british prisoner of war. another philadelphia
merchant, robert morris, won for himself the name of the "patriot
financier" because he labored night and day to find the money to meet
the bills which poured in upon the bankrupt government. when his own
funds were exhausted, he borrowed from his friends. experienced in the
handling of merchandise, he created agencies at important points to
distribute supplies to the troops, thus displaying administrative as
well as financial talents.

[illustration: robert morris]

women organized "drives" for money, contributed their plate and their
jewels, and collected from door to door. farmers took worthless paper in
return for their produce, and soldiers saw many a pay day pass without
yielding them a penny. thus by the labors and sacrifices of citizens,
the issuance of paper money, lotteries, the floating of loans,
borrowings in europe, and the impressment of supplies, the congress
staggered through the revolution like a pauper who knows not how his
next meal is to be secured but is continuously relieved at a crisis by a
kindly fate.


the diplomacy of the revolution

when the full measure of honor is given to the soldiers and sailors and
their commanding officers, the civilians who managed finances and
supplies, the writers who sustained the american spirit, and the women
who did well their part, there yet remains the duty of recognizing the
achievements of diplomacy. the importance of this field of activity was
keenly appreciated by the leaders in the continental congress. they were
fairly well versed in european history. they knew of the balance of
power and the sympathies, interests, and prejudices of nations and their
rulers. all this information they turned to good account, in opening
relations with continental countries and seeking money, supplies, and
even military assistance. for the transaction of this delicate business,
they created a secret committee on foreign correspondence as early as
1775 and prepared to send agents abroad.

=american agents sent abroad.=--having heard that france was inclining a
friendly ear to the american cause, the congress, in march, 1776, sent a
commissioner to paris, silas deane of connecticut, often styled the
"first american diplomat." later in the year a form of treaty to be
presented to foreign powers was drawn up, and franklin, arthur lee, and
deane were selected as american representatives at the court of "his
most christian majesty the king of france." john jay of new york was
chosen minister to spain in 1779; john adams was sent to holland the
same year; and other agents were dispatched to florence, vienna, and
berlin. the representative selected for st. petersburg spent two
fruitless years there, "ignored by the court, living in obscurity and
experiencing nothing but humiliation and failure." frederick the great,
king of prussia, expressed a desire to find in america a market for
silesian linens and woolens, but, fearing england's command of the sea,
he refused to give direct aid to the revolutionary cause.

=early french interest.=--the great diplomatic triumph of the revolution
was won at paris, and benjamin franklin was the hero of the occasion,
although many circumstances prepared the way for his success. louis
xvi's foreign minister, count de vergennes, before the arrival of any
american representative, had brought to the attention of the king the
opportunity offered by the outbreak of the war between england and her
colonies. he showed him how france could redress her grievances and
"reduce the power and greatness of england"--the empire that in 1763 had
forced upon her a humiliating peace "at the price of our possessions,
of our commerce, and our credit in the indies, at the price of canada,
louisiana, isle royale, acadia, and senegal." equally successful in
gaining the king's interest was a curious french adventurer,
beaumarchais, a man of wealth, a lover of music, and the author of two
popular plays, "figaro" and "the barber of seville." these two men had
already urged upon the king secret aid for america before deane appeared
on the scene. shortly after his arrival they made confidential
arrangements to furnish money, clothing, powder, and other supplies to
the struggling colonies, although official requests for them were
officially refused by the french government.

=franklin at paris.=--when franklin reached paris, he was received only
in private by the king's minister, vergennes. the french people,
however, made manifest their affection for the "plain republican" in
"his full dress suit of spotted manchester velvet." he was known among
men of letters as an author, a scientist, and a philosopher of
extraordinary ability. his "poor richard" had thrice been translated
into french and was scattered in numerous editions throughout the
kingdom. people of all ranks--ministers, ladies at court, philosophers,
peasants, and stable boys--knew of franklin and wished him success in
his mission. the queen, marie antoinette, fated to lose her head in a
revolution soon to follow, played with fire by encouraging "our dear
republican."

for the king of france, however, this was more serious business. england
resented the presence of this "traitor" in paris, and louis had to be
cautious about plunging into another war that might also end
disastrously. moreover, the early period of franklin's sojourn in paris
was a dark hour for the american revolution. washington's brilliant
exploit at trenton on christmas night, 1776, and the battle with
cornwallis at princeton had been followed by the disaster at brandywine,
the loss of philadelphia, the defeat at germantown, and the retirement
to valley forge for the winter of 1777-78. new york city and
philadelphia--two strategic ports--were in british hands; the hudson
and delaware rivers were blocked; and general burgoyne with his british
troops was on his way down through the heart of northern new york,
cutting new england off from the rest of the colonies. no wonder the
king was cautious. then the unexpected happened. burgoyne, hemmed in
from all sides by the american forces, his flanks harried, his foraging
parties beaten back, his supplies cut off, surrendered on october 17,
1777, to general gates, who had superseded general schuyler in time to
receive the honor.

=treaties of alliance and commerce (1778).=--news of this victory,
placed by historians among the fifteen decisive battles of the world,
reached franklin one night early in december while he and some friends
sat gloomily at dinner. beaumarchais, who was with him, grasped at once
the meaning of the situation and set off to the court at versailles with
such haste that he upset his coach and dislocated his arm. the king and
his ministers were at last convinced that the hour had come to aid the
revolution. treaties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and signed
in february, 1778. the independence of the united states was recognized
by france and an alliance was formed to guarantee that independence.
combined military action was agreed upon and louis then formally
declared war on england. men who had, a few short years before, fought
one another in the wilderness of pennsylvania or on the plains of
abraham, were now ranged side by side in a war on the empire that pitt
had erected and that george iii was pulling down.

=spain and holland involved.=--within a few months, spain, remembering
the steady decline of her sea power since the days of the armada and
hoping to drive the british out of gibraltar, once more joined the
concert of nations against england. holland, a member of a league of
armed neutrals formed in protest against british searches on the high
seas, sent her fleet to unite with the forces of spain, france, and
america to prey upon british commerce. to all this trouble for england
was added the danger of a possible revolt in ireland, where the spirit
of independence was flaming up.

=the british offer terms to america.=--seeing the colonists about to be
joined by france in a common war on the english empire, lord north
proposed, in february, 1778, a renewal of negotiations. by solemn
enactment, parliament declared its intention not to exercise the right
of imposing taxes within the colonies; at the same time it authorized
the opening of negotiations through commissioners to be sent to america.
a truce was to be established, pardons granted, objectionable laws
suspended, and the old imperial constitution, as it stood before the
opening of hostilities, restored to full vigor. it was too late. events
had taken the affairs of america out of the hands of british
commissioners and diplomats.

=effects of french aid.=--the french alliance brought ships of war,
large sums of gold and silver, loads of supplies, and a considerable
body of trained soldiers to the aid of the americans. timely as was this
help, it meant no sudden change in the fortunes of war. the british
evacuated philadelphia in the summer following the alliance, and
washington's troops were encouraged to come out of valley forge. they
inflicted a heavy blow on the british at monmouth, but the treasonable
conduct of general charles lee prevented a triumph. the recovery of
philadelphia was offset by the treason of benedict arnold, the loss of
savannah and charleston (1780), and the defeat of gates at camden.

the full effect of the french alliance was not felt until 1781, when
cornwallis went into virginia and settled at yorktown. accompanied by
french troops washington swept rapidly southward and penned the british
to the shore while a powerful french fleet shut off their escape by sea.
it was this movement, which certainly could not have been executed
without french aid, that put an end to all chance of restoring british
dominion in america. it was the surrender of cornwallis at yorktown that
caused lord north to pace the floor and cry out: "it is all over! it is
all over!" what might have been done without the french alliance lies
hidden from mankind. what was accomplished with the help of french
soldiers, sailors, officers, money, and supplies, is known to all the
earth. "all the world agree," exultantly wrote franklin from paris to
general washington, "that no expedition was ever better planned or
better executed. it brightens the glory that must accompany your name to
the latest posterity." diplomacy as well as martial valor had its
reward.


peace at last

=british opposition to the war.=--in measuring the forces that led to
the final discomfiture of king george and lord north, it is necessary to
remember that from the beginning to the end the british ministry at home
faced a powerful, informed, and relentless opposition. there were
vigorous protests, first against the obnoxious acts which precipitated
the unhappy quarrel, then against the way in which the war was waged,
and finally against the futile struggle to retain a hold upon the
american dominions. among the members of parliament who thundered
against the government were the first statesmen and orators of the land.
william pitt, earl of chatham, though he deplored the idea of american
independence, denounced the government as the aggressor and rejoiced in
american resistance. edmund burke leveled his heavy batteries against
every measure of coercion and at last strove for a peace which, while
giving independence to america, would work for reconciliation rather
than estrangement. charles james fox gave the colonies his generous
sympathy and warmly championed their rights. outside of the circle of
statesmen there were stout friends of the american cause like david
hume, the philosopher and historian, and catherine macaulay, an author
of wide fame and a republican bold enough to encourage washington in
seeing it through.

against this powerful opposition, the government enlisted a whole army
of scribes and journalists to pour out criticism on the americans and
their friends. dr. samuel johnson, whom it employed in this business,
was so savage that even the ministers had to tone down his pamphlets
before printing them. far more weighty was edward gibbon, who was in
time to win fame as the historian of the _decline and fall of the roman
empire_. he had at first opposed the government; but, on being given a
lucrative post, he used his sharp pen in its support, causing his
friends to ridicule him in these lines:

    "king george, in a fright
     lest gibbon should write
       the story of england's disgrace,
     thought no way so sure
     his pen to secure
       as to give the historian a place."

=lord north yields.=--as time wore on, events bore heavily on the side
of the opponents of the government's measures. they had predicted that
conquest was impossible, and they had urged the advantages of a peace
which would in some measure restore the affections of the americans.
every day's news confirmed their predictions and lent support to their
arguments. moreover, the war, which sprang out of an effort to relieve
english burdens, made those burdens heavier than ever. military expenses
were daily increasing. trade with the colonies, the greatest single
outlet for british goods and capital, was paralyzed. the heavy debts due
british merchants in america were not only unpaid but postponed into an
indefinite future. ireland was on the verge of revolution. the french
had a dangerous fleet on the high seas. in vain did the king assert in
december, 1781, that no difficulties would ever make him consent to a
peace that meant american independence. parliament knew better, and on
february 27, 1782, in the house of commons was carried an address to the
throne against continuing the war. burke, fox, the younger pitt, barre,
and other friends of the colonies voted in the affirmative. lord north
gave notice then that his ministry was at an end. the king moaned:
"necessity made me yield."

in april, 1782, franklin received word from the english government that
it was prepared to enter into negotiations leading to a settlement. this
was embarrassing. in the treaty of alliance with france, the united
states had promised that peace should be a joint affair agreed to by
both nations in open conference. finding france, however, opposed to
some of their claims respecting boundaries and fisheries, the american
commissioners conferred with the british agents at paris without
consulting the french minister. they actually signed a preliminary peace
draft before they informed him of their operations. when vergennes
reproached him, franklin replied that they "had been guilty of
neglecting _bienseance_ [good manners] but hoped that the great work
would not be ruined by a single indiscretion."

=the terms of peace (1783).=--the general settlement at paris in 1783
was a triumph for america. england recognized the independence of the
united states, naming each state specifically, and agreed to boundaries
extending from the atlantic to the mississippi and from the great lakes
to the floridas. england held canada, newfoundland, and the west indies
intact, made gains in india, and maintained her supremacy on the seas.
spain won florida and minorca but not the coveted gibraltar. france
gained nothing important save the satisfaction of seeing england humbled
and the colonies independent.

the generous terms secured by the american commission at paris called
forth surprise and gratitude in the united states and smoothed the way
for a renewal of commercial relations with the mother country. at the
same time they gave genuine anxiety to european diplomats. "this federal
republic is born a pigmy," wrote the spanish ambassador to his royal
master. "a day will come when it will be a giant; even a colossus
formidable to these countries. liberty of conscience and the facility
for establishing a new population on immense lands, as well as the
advantages of the new government, will draw thither farmers and artisans
from all the nations. in a few years we shall watch with grief the
tyrannical existence of the same colossus."

summary of the revolutionary period

the independence of the american colonies was foreseen by many european
statesmen as they watched the growth of their population, wealth, and
power; but no one could fix the hour of the great event. until 1763 the
american colonists lived fairly happily under british dominion. there
were collisions from time to time, of course. royal governors clashed
with stiff-necked colonial legislatures. there were protests against the
exercise of the king's veto power in specific cases. nevertheless, on
the whole, the relations between america and the mother country were
more amicable in 1763 than at any period under the stuart regime which
closed in 1688.

the crash, when it came, was not deliberately willed by any one. it was
the product of a number of forces that happened to converge about 1763.
three years before, there had come to the throne george iii, a young,
proud, inexperienced, and stubborn king. for nearly fifty years his
predecessors, germans as they were in language and interest, had allowed
things to drift in england and america. george iii decided that he would
be king in fact as well as in name. about the same time england brought
to a close the long and costly french and indian war and was staggering
under a heavy burden of debt and taxes. the war had been fought partly
in defense of the american colonies and nothing seemed more reasonable
to english statesmen than the idea that the colonies should bear part of
the cost of their own defense. at this juncture there came into
prominence, in royal councils, two men bent on taxing america and
controlling her trade, grenville and townshend. the king was willing,
the english taxpayers were thankful for any promise of relief, and
statesmen were found to undertake the experiment. england therefore set
out upon a new course. she imposed taxes upon the colonists, regulated
their trade and set royal officers upon them to enforce the law. this
action evoked protests from the colonists. they held a stamp act
congress to declare their rights and petition for a redress of
grievances. some of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets,
sacked the houses of the king's officers, and tore up the stamped paper.

frightened by uprising, the english government drew back and repealed
the stamp act. then it veered again and renewed its policy of
interference. interference again called forth american protests.
protests aroused sharper retaliation. more british regulars were sent
over to keep order. more irritating laws were passed by parliament.
rioting again appeared: tea was dumped in the harbor of boston and
seized in the harbor of charleston. the british answer was more force.
the response of the colonists was a continental congress for defense. an
unexpected and unintended clash of arms at lexington and concord in the
spring of 1775 brought forth from the king of england a proclamation:
"the americans are rebels!"

the die was cast. the american revolution had begun. washington was made
commander-in-chief. armies were raised, money was borrowed, a huge
volume of paper currency was issued, and foreign aid was summoned.
franklin plied his diplomatic arts at paris until in 1778 he induced
france to throw her sword into the balance. three years later,
cornwallis surrendered at yorktown. in 1783, by the formal treaty of
peace, george iii acknowledged the independence of the united states.
the new nation, endowed with an imperial domain stretching from the
atlantic ocean to the mississippi river, began its career among the
sovereign powers of the earth.

in the sphere of civil government, the results of the revolution were
equally remarkable. royal officers and royal authorities were driven
from the former dominions. all power was declared to be in the people.
all the colonies became states, each with its own constitution or plan
of government. the thirteen states were united in common bonds under the
articles of confederation. a republic on a large scale was instituted.
thus there was begun an adventure in popular government such as the
world had never seen. could it succeed or was it destined to break down
and be supplanted by a monarchy? the fate of whole continents hung upon
the answer.

the promise and the difficulties of america

the rise of a young republic composed of thirteen states, each governed
by officials popularly elected under constitutions drafted by "the plain
people," was the most significant feature of the eighteenth century. the
majority of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices had made this
possible naturally looked upon their work and pronounced it good. those
americans, however, who peered beneath the surface of things, saw that
the declaration of independence, even if splendidly phrased, and paper
constitutions, drawn by finest enthusiasm "uninstructed by experience,"
could not alone make the republic great and prosperous or even free. all
around them they saw chaos in finance and in industry and perils for the
immediate future.

=the weakness of the articles of confederation.=--the government under
the articles of confederation had neither the strength nor the resources
necessary to cope with the problems of reconstruction left by the war.
the sole organ of government was a congress composed of from two to
seven members from each state chosen as the legislature might direct and
paid by the state. in determining all questions, each state had one
vote--delaware thus enjoying the same weight as virginia. there was no
president to enforce the laws. congress was given power to select a
committee of thirteen--one from each state--to act as an executive body
when it was not in session; but this device, on being tried out, proved
a failure. there was no system of national courts to which citizens and
states could appeal for the protection of their rights or through which
they could compel obedience to law. the two great powers of government,
military and financial, were withheld. congress, it is true, could
authorize expenditures but had to rely upon the states for the payment
of contributions to meet its bills. it could also order the
establishment of an army, but it could only request the states to supply
their respective quotas of soldiers. it could not lay taxes nor bring
any pressure to bear upon a single citizen in the whole country. it
could act only through the medium of the state governments.

=financial and commercial disorders.=--in the field of public finance,
the disorders were pronounced. the huge debt incurred during the war was
still outstanding. congress was unable to pay either the interest or the
principal. public creditors were in despair, as the market value of
their bonds sank to twenty-five or even ten cents on the dollar. the
current bills of congress were unpaid. as some one complained, there was
not enough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with which to record
the transactions of the shadow legislature. the currency was in utter
chaos. millions of dollars in notes issued by congress had become mere
trash worth a cent or two on the dollar. there was no other expression
of contempt so forceful as the popular saying: "not worth a
continental." to make matters worse, several of the states were pouring
new streams of paper money from the press. almost the only good money in
circulation consisted of english, french, and spanish coins, and the
public was even defrauded by them because money changers were busy
clipping and filing away the metal. foreign commerce was unsettled. the
entire british system of trade discrimination was turned against the
americans, and congress, having no power to regulate foreign commerce,
was unable to retaliate or to negotiate treaties which it could enforce.
domestic commerce was impeded by the jealousies of the states, which
erected tariff barriers against their neighbors. the condition of the
currency made the exchange of money and goods extremely difficult, and,
as if to increase the confusion, backward states enacted laws hindering
the prompt collection of debts within their borders--an evil which
nothing but a national system of courts could cure.

=congress in disrepute.=--with treaties set at naught by the states, the
laws unenforced, the treasury empty, and the public credit gone, the
congress of the united states fell into utter disrepute. it called upon
the states to pay their quotas of money into the treasury, only to be
treated with contempt. even its own members looked upon it as a solemn
futility. some of the ablest men refused to accept election to it, and
many who did take the doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions.
again and again it was impossible to secure a quorum for the transaction
of business.

=troubles of the state governments.=--the state governments, free to
pursue their own course with no interference from without, had almost as
many difficulties as the congress. they too were loaded with
revolutionary debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already restive
population. oppressed by their financial burdens and discouraged by the
fall in prices which followed the return of peace, the farmers of
several states joined in a concerted effort and compelled their
legislatures to issue large sums of paper money. the currency fell in
value, but nevertheless it was forced on unwilling creditors to square
old accounts.

in every part of the country legislative action fluctuated violently.
laws were made one year only to be repealed the next and reenacted the
third year. lands were sold by one legislature and the sales were
canceled by its successor. uncertainty and distrust were the natural
consequences. men of substance longed for some power that would forbid
states to issue bills of credit, to make paper money legal tender in
payment of debts, or to impair the obligation of contracts. men heavily
in debt, on the other hand, urged even more drastic action against
creditors.

so great did the discontent of the farmers in new hampshire become in
1786 that a mob surrounded the legislature, demanding a repeal of the
taxes and the issuance of paper money. it was with difficulty that an
armed rebellion was avoided. in massachusetts the malcontents, under the
leadership of daniel shays, a captain in the revolutionary army,
organized that same year open resistance to the government of the state.
shays and his followers protested against the conduct of creditors in
foreclosing mortgages upon the debt-burdened farmers, against the
lawyers for increasing the costs of legal proceedings, against the
senate of the state the members of which were apportioned among the
towns on the basis of the amount of taxes paid, against heavy taxes, and
against the refusal of the legislature to issue paper money. they seized
the towns of worcester and springfield and broke up the courts of
justice. all through the western part of the state the revolt spread,
sending a shock of alarm to every center and section of the young
republic. only by the most vigorous action was governor bowdoin able to
quell the uprising; and when that task was accomplished, the state
government did not dare to execute any of the prisoners because they had
so many sympathizers. moreover, bowdoin and several members of the
legislature who had been most zealous in their attacks on the insurgents
were defeated at the ensuing election. the need of national assistance
for state governments in times of domestic violence was everywhere
emphasized by men who were opposed to revolutionary acts.

=alarm over dangers to the republic.=--leading american citizens,
watching the drift of affairs, were slowly driven to the conclusion that
the new ship of state so proudly launched a few years before was
careening into anarchy. "the facts of our peace and independence," wrote
a friend of washington, "do not at present wear so promising an
appearance as i had fondly painted in my mind. the prejudices,
jealousies, and turbulence of the people at times almost stagger my
confidence in our political establishments; and almost occasion me to
think that they will show themselves unworthy of the noble prize for
which we have contended."

washington himself was profoundly discouraged. on hearing of shays's
rebellion, he exclaimed: "what, gracious god, is man that there should
be such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct! it is but the
other day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions
under which we now live--constitutions of our own choice and making--and
now we are unsheathing our sword to overturn them." the same year he
burst out in a lament over rumors of restoring royal government. "i am
told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical government
without horror. from thinking proceeds speaking. hence to acting is
often but a single step. but how irresistible and tremendous! what a
triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions! what a triumph for
the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing
ourselves!"

=congress attempts some reforms.=--the congress was not indifferent to
the events that disturbed washington. on the contrary it put forth many
efforts to check tendencies so dangerous to finance, commerce,
industries, and the confederation itself. in 1781, even before the
treaty of peace was signed, the congress, having found out how futile
were its taxing powers, carried a resolution of amendment to the
articles of confederation, authorizing the levy of a moderate duty on
imports. yet this mild measure was rejected by the states. two years
later the congress prepared another amendment sanctioning the levy of
duties on imports, to be collected this time by state officers and
applied to the payment of the public debt. this more limited proposal,
designed to save public credit, likewise failed. in 1786, the congress
made a third appeal to the states for help, declaring that they had been
so irregular and so negligent in paying their quotas that further
reliance upon that mode of raising revenues was dishonorable and
dangerous.


the calling of a constitutional convention

=hamilton and washington urge reform.=--the attempts at reform by the
congress were accompanied by demand for, both within and without that
body, a convention to frame a new plan of government. in 1780, the
youthful alexander hamilton, realizing the weakness of the articles, so
widely discussed, proposed a general convention for the purpose of
drafting a new constitution on entirely different principles. with
tireless energy he strove to bring his countrymen to his view.
washington, agreeing with him on every point, declared, in a circular
letter to the governors, that the duration of the union would be short
unless there was lodged somewhere a supreme power "to regulate and
govern the general concerns of the confederated republic." the governor
of massachusetts, disturbed by the growth of discontent all about him,
suggested to the state legislature in 1785 the advisability of a
national convention to enlarge the powers of the congress. the
legislature approved the plan, but did not press it to a conclusion.

[illustration: alexander hamilton]

=the annapolis convention.=--action finally came from the south. the
virginia legislature, taking things into its own hands, called a
conference of delegates at annapolis to consider matters of taxation and
commerce. when the convention assembled in 1786, it was found that only
five states had taken the trouble to send representatives. the leaders
were deeply discouraged, but the resourceful hamilton, a delegate from
new york, turned the affair to good account. he secured the adoption of
a resolution, calling upon the congress itself to summon another
convention, to meet at philadelphia.

=a national convention called (1787).=--the congress, as tardy as ever,
at last decided in february, 1787, to issue the call. fearing drastic
changes, however, it restricted the convention to "the sole and express
purpose of revising the articles of confederation." jealous of its own
powers, it added that any alterations proposed should be referred to the
congress and the states for their approval.

every state in the union, except rhode island, responded to this call.
indeed some of the states, having the annapolis resolution before them,
had already anticipated the congress by selecting delegates before the
formal summons came. thus, by the persistence of governors,
legislatures, and private citizens, there was brought about the
long-desired national convention. in may, 1787, it assembled in
philadelphia.

=the eminent men of the convention.=--on the roll of that memorable
convention were fifty-five men, at least half of whom were acknowledged
to be among the foremost statesmen and thinkers in america. every field
of statecraft was represented by them: war and practical management in
washington, who was chosen president of the convention; diplomacy in
franklin, now old and full of honor in his own land as well as abroad;
finance in alexander hamilton and robert morris; law in james wilson of
pennsylvania; the philosophy of government in james madison, called the
"father of the constitution." they were not theorists but practical men,
rich in political experience and endowed with deep insight into the
springs of human action. three of them had served in the stamp act
congress: dickinson of delaware, william samuel johnson of connecticut,
and john rutledge of south carolina. eight had been signers of the
declaration of independence: read of delaware, sherman of connecticut,
wythe of virginia, gerry of massachusetts, franklin, robert morris,
george clymer, and james wilson of pennsylvania. all but twelve had at
some time served in the continental congress and eighteen were members
of that body in the spring of 1787. washington, hamilton, mifflin, and
charles pinckney had been officers in the revolutionary army. seven of
the delegates had gained political experience as governors of states.
"the convention as a whole," according to the historian hildreth,
"represented in a marked manner the talent, intelligence, and
especially the conservative sentiment of the country."


the framing of the constitution

=problems involved.=--the great problems before the convention were nine
in number: (1) shall the articles of confederation be revised or a new
system of government constructed? (2) shall the government be founded on
states equal in power as under the articles or on the broader and deeper
foundation of population? (3) what direct share shall the people have in
the election of national officers? (4) what shall be the qualifications
for the suffrage? (5) how shall the conflicting interests of the
commercial and the planting states be balanced so as to safeguard the
essential rights of each? (6) what shall be the form of the new
government? (7) what powers shall be conferred on it? (8) how shall the
state legislatures be restrained from their attacks on property rights
such as the issuance of paper money? (9) shall the approval of all the
states be necessary, as under the articles, for the adoption and
amendment of the constitution?

=revision of the articles or a new government?=--the moment the first
problem was raised, representatives of the small states, led by william
paterson of new jersey, were on their feet. they feared that, if the
articles were overthrown, the equality and rights of the states would be
put in jeopardy. their protest was therefore vigorous. they cited the
call issued by the congress in summoning the convention which
specifically stated that they were assembled for "the sole and express
purpose of revising the articles of confederation." they cited also
their instructions from their state legislatures, which authorized them
to "revise and amend" the existing scheme of government, not to make a
revolution in it. to depart from the authorization laid down by the
congress and the legislatures would be to exceed their powers, they
argued, and to betray the trust reposed in them by their countrymen.

to their contentions, randolph of virginia replied: "when the salvation
of the republic is at stake, it would be treason to our trust not to
propose what we find necessary." hamilton, reminding the delegates that
their work was still subject to the approval of the states, frankly said
that on the point of their powers he had no scruples. with the issue
clear, the convention cast aside the articles as if they did not exist
and proceeded to the work of drawing up a new constitution, "laying its
foundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such form"
as to the delegates seemed "most likely to affect their safety and
happiness."

=a government founded on states or on people?--the
compromise.=--defeated in their attempt to limit the convention to a
mere revision of the articles, the spokesmen of the smaller states
redoubled their efforts to preserve the equality of the states. the
signal for a radical departure from the articles on this point was given
early in the sessions when randolph presented "the virginia plan." he
proposed that the new national legislature consist of two houses, the
members of which were to be apportioned among the states according to
their wealth or free white population, as the convention might decide.
this plan was vehemently challenged. paterson of new jersey flatly
avowed that neither he nor his state would ever bow to such tyranny. as
an alternative, he presented "the new jersey plan" calling for a
national legislature of one house representing states as such, not
wealth or people--a legislature in which all states, large or small,
would have equal voice. wilson of pennsylvania, on behalf of the more
populous states, took up the gauntlet which paterson had thrown down. it
was absurd, he urged, for 180,000 men in one state to have the same
weight in national counsels as 750,000 men in another state. "the
gentleman from new jersey," he said, "is candid. he declares his opinion
boldly.... i will be equally candid.... i will never confederate on his
principles." so the bitter controversy ran on through many exciting
sessions.

greek had met greek. the convention was hopelessly deadlocked and on the
verge of dissolution, "scarce held together by the strength of a hair,"
as one of the delegates remarked. a crash was averted only by a
compromise. instead of a congress of one house as provided by the
articles, the convention agreed upon a legislature of two houses. in the
senate, the aspirations of the small states were to be satisfied, for
each state was given two members in that body. in the formation of the
house of representatives, the larger states were placated, for it was
agreed that the members of that chamber were to be apportioned among the
states on the basis of population, counting three-fifths of the slaves.

=the question of popular election.=--the method of selecting federal
officers and members of congress also produced an acrimonious debate
which revealed how deep-seated was the distrust of the capacity of the
people to govern themselves. few there were who believed that no branch
of the government should be elected directly by the voters; still fewer
were there, however, who desired to see all branches so chosen. one or
two even expressed a desire for a monarchy. the dangers of democracy
were stressed by gerry of massachusetts: "all the evils we experience
flow from an excess of democracy. the people do not want virtue but are
the dupes of pretended patriots.... i have been too republican
heretofore but have been taught by experience the danger of a leveling
spirit." to the "democratic licentiousness of the state legislatures,"
randolph sought to oppose a "firm senate." to check the excesses of
popular government charles pinckney of south carolina declared that no
one should be elected president who was not worth $100,000 and that high
property qualifications should be placed on members of congress and
judges. other members of the convention were stoutly opposed to such
"high-toned notions of government." franklin and wilson, both from
pennsylvania, vigorously championed popular election; while men like
madison insisted that at least one part of the government should rest on
the broad foundation of the people.

out of this clash of opinion also came compromise. one branch, the house
of representatives, it was agreed, was to be elected directly by the
voters, while the senators were to be elected indirectly by the state
legislatures. the president was to be chosen by electors selected as the
legislatures of the states might determine, and the judges of the
federal courts, supreme and inferior, by the president and the senate.

=the question of the suffrage.=--the battle over the suffrage was sharp
but brief. gouverneur morris proposed that only land owners should be
permitted to vote. madison replied that the state legislatures, which
had made so much trouble with radical laws, were elected by freeholders.
after the debate, the delegates, unable to agree on any property
limitations on the suffrage, decided that the house of representatives
should be elected by voters having the "qualifications requisite for
electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature." thus
they accepted the suffrage provisions of the states.

=the balance between the planting and the commercial states.=--after the
debates had gone on for a few weeks, madison came to the conclusion that
the real division in the convention was not between the large and the
small states but between the planting section founded on slave labor and
the commercial north. thus he anticipated by nearly three-quarters of a
century "the irrepressible conflict." the planting states had neither
the free white population nor the wealth of the north. there were,
counting delaware, six of them as against seven commercial states.
dependent for their prosperity mainly upon the sale of tobacco, rice,
and other staples abroad, they feared that congress might impose
restraints upon their enterprise. being weaker in numbers, they were
afraid that the majority might lay an unfair burden of taxes upon them.

_representation and taxation._--the southern members of the convention
were therefore very anxious to secure for their section the largest
possible representation in congress, and at the same time to restrain
the taxing power of that body. two devices were thought adapted to these
ends. one was to count the slaves as people when apportioning
representatives among the states according to their respective
populations; the other was to provide that direct taxes should be
apportioned among the states, in proportion not to their wealth but to
the number of their free white inhabitants. for obvious reasons the
northern delegates objected to these proposals. once more a compromise
proved to be the solution. it was agreed that not all the slaves but
three-fifths of them should be counted for both purposes--representation
and direct taxation.

_commerce and the slave trade._--southern interests were also involved
in the project to confer upon congress the power to regulate interstate
and foreign commerce. to the manufacturing and trading states this was
essential. it would prevent interstate tariffs and trade jealousies; it
would enable congress to protect american manufactures and to break
down, by appropriate retaliations, foreign discriminations against
american commerce. to the south the proposal was menacing because
tariffs might interfere with the free exchange of the produce of
plantations in european markets, and navigation acts might confine the
carrying trade to american, that is northern, ships. the importation of
slaves, moreover, it was feared might be heavily taxed or immediately
prohibited altogether.

the result of this and related controversies was a debate on the merits
of slavery. gouverneur morris delivered his mind and heart on that
subject, denouncing slavery as a nefarious institution and the curse of
heaven on the states in which it prevailed. mason of virginia, a
slaveholder himself, was hardly less outspoken, saying: "slavery
discourages arts and manufactures. the poor despise labor when performed
by slaves. they prevent the migration of whites who really strengthen
and enrich a country."

the system, however, had its defenders. representatives from south
carolina argued that their entire economic life rested on slave labor
and that the high death rate in the rice swamps made continuous
importation necessary. ellsworth of connecticut took the ground that
the convention should not meddle with slavery. "the morality or wisdom
of slavery," he said, "are considerations belonging to the states. what
enriches a part enriches the whole." to the future he turned an
untroubled face: "as population increases, poor laborers will be so
plenty as to render slaves useless. slavery in time will not be a speck
in our country." virginia and north carolina, already overstocked with
slaves, favored prohibiting the traffic in them; but south carolina was
adamant. she must have fresh supplies of slaves or she would not
federate.

so it was agreed that, while congress might regulate foreign trade by
majority vote, the importation of slaves should not be forbidden before
the lapse of twenty years, and that any import tax should not exceed $10
a head. at the same time, in connection with the regulation of foreign
trade, it was stipulated that a two-thirds vote in the senate should be
necessary in the ratification of treaties. a further concession to the
south was made in the provision for the return of runaway slaves--a
provision also useful in the north, where indentured servants were about
as troublesome as slaves in escaping from their masters.

=the form of the government.=--as to the details of the frame of
government and the grand principles involved, the opinion of the
convention ebbed and flowed, decisions being taken in the heat of
debate, only to be revoked and taken again.

_the executive._--there was general agreement that there should be an
executive branch; for reliance upon congress to enforce its own laws and
treaties had been a broken reed. on the character and functions of the
executive, however, there were many views. the new jersey plan called
for a council selected by the congress; the virginia plan provided that
the executive branch should be chosen by the congress but did not state
whether it should be composed of one or several persons. on this matter
the convention voted first one way and then another; finally it agreed
on a single executive chosen indirectly by electors selected as the
state legislatures might decide, serving for four years, subject to
impeachment, and endowed with regal powers in the command of the army
and the navy and in the enforcement of the laws.

_the legislative branch--congress._--after the convention had made the
great compromise between the large and small commonwealths by giving
representation to states in the senate and to population in the house,
the question of methods of election had to be decided. as to the house
of representatives it was readily agreed that the members should be
elected by direct popular vote. there was also easy agreement on the
proposition that a strong senate was needed to check the "turbulence" of
the lower house. four devices were finally selected to accomplish this
purpose. in the first place, the senators were not to be chosen directly
by the voters but by the legislatures of the states, thus removing their
election one degree from the populace. in the second place, their term
was fixed at six years instead of two, as in the case of the house. in
the third place, provision was made for continuity by having only
one-third of the members go out at a time while two-thirds remained in
service. finally, it was provided that senators must be at least thirty
years old while representatives need be only twenty-five.

_the judiciary._--the need for federal courts to carry out the law was
hardly open to debate. the feebleness of the articles of confederation
was, in a large measure, attributed to the want of a judiciary to hold
states and individuals in obedience to the laws and treaties of the
union. nevertheless on this point the advocates of states' rights were
extremely sensitive. they looked with distrust upon judges appointed at
the national capital and emancipated from local interests and
traditions; they remembered with what insistence they had claimed
against britain the right of local trial by jury and with what
consternation they had viewed the proposal to make colonial judges
independent of the assemblies in the matter of their salaries.
reluctantly they yielded to the demand for federal courts, consenting at
first only to a supreme court to review cases heard in lower state
courts and finally to such additional inferior courts as congress might
deem necessary.

_the system of checks and balances._--it is thus apparent that the
framers of the constitution, in shaping the form of government, arranged
for a distribution of power among three branches, executive,
legislative, and judicial. strictly speaking we might say four branches,
for the legislature, or congress, was composed of two houses, elected in
different ways, and one of them, the senate, was made a check on the
president through its power of ratifying treaties and appointments. "the
accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judicial, in the
same hands," wrote madison, "whether of one, a few, or many, and whether
hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the
very definition of tyranny." the devices which the convention adopted to
prevent such a centralization of authority were exceedingly ingenious
and well calculated to accomplish the purposes of the authors.

the legislature consisted of two houses, the members of which were to be
apportioned on a different basis, elected in different ways, and to
serve for different terms. a veto on all its acts was vested in a
president elected in a manner not employed in the choice of either
branch of the legislature, serving for four years, and subject to
removal only by the difficult process of impeachment. after a law had
run the gantlet of both houses and the executive, it was subject to
interpretation and annulment by the judiciary, appointed by the
president with the consent of the senate and serving for life. thus it
was made almost impossible for any political party to get possession of
all branches of the government at a single popular election. as hamilton
remarked, the friends of good government considered "every institution
calculated to restrain the excess of law making and to keep things in
the same state in which they happen to be at any given period as more
likely to do good than harm."

=the powers of the federal government.=--on the question of the powers
to be conferred upon the new government there was less occasion for a
serious dispute. even the delegates from the small states agreed with
those from massachusetts, pennsylvania, and virginia that new powers
should be added to those intrusted to congress by the articles of
confederation. the new jersey plan as well as the virginia plan
recognized this fact. some of the delegates, like hamilton and madison,
even proposed to give congress a general legislative authority covering
all national matters; but others, frightened by the specter of
nationalism, insisted on specifying each power to be conferred and
finally carried the day.

_taxation and commerce._--there were none bold enough to dissent from
the proposition that revenue must be provided to pay current expenses
and discharge the public debt. when once the dispute over the
apportionment of direct taxes among the slave states was settled, it was
an easy matter to decide that congress should have power to lay and
collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises. in this way the national
government was freed from dependence upon stubborn and tardy
legislatures and enabled to collect funds directly from citizens. there
were likewise none bold enough to contend that the anarchy of state
tariffs and trade discriminations should be longer endured. when the
fears of the planting states were allayed and the "bargain" over the
importation of slaves was reached, the convention vested in congress the
power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce.

_national defense._--the necessity for national defense was realized,
though the fear of huge military establishments was equally present. the
old practice of relying on quotas furnished by the state legislatures
was completely discredited. as in the case of taxes a direct authority
over citizens was demanded. congress was therefore given full power to
raise and support armies and a navy. it could employ the state militia
when desirable; but it could at the same time maintain a regular army
and call directly upon all able-bodied males if the nature of a crisis
was thought to require it.

_the "necessary and proper" clause._--to the specified power vested in
congress by the constitution, the advocates of a strong national
government added a general clause authorizing it to make all laws
"necessary and proper" for carrying into effect any and all of the
enumerated powers. this clause, interpreted by that master mind, chief
justice marshall, was later construed to confer powers as wide as the
requirements of a vast country spanning a continent and taking its place
among the mighty nations of the earth.

=restraints on the states.=--framing a government and endowing it with
large powers were by no means the sole concern of the convention. its
very existence had been due quite as much to the conduct of the state
legislatures as to the futilities of a paralyzed continental congress.
in every state, explains marshall in his _life of washington_, there was
a party of men who had "marked out for themselves a more indulgent
course. viewing with extreme tenderness the case of the debtor, their
efforts were unceasingly directed to his relief. to exact a faithful
compliance with contracts was, in their opinion, a harsh measure which
the people could not bear. they were uniformly in favor of relaxing the
administration of justice, of affording facilities for the payment of
debts, or of suspending their collection, and remitting taxes."

the legislatures under the dominance of these men had enacted paper
money laws enabling debtors to discharge their obligations more easily.
the convention put an end to such practices by providing that no state
should emit bills of credit or make anything but gold or silver legal
tender in the payment of debts. the state legislatures had enacted laws
allowing men to pay their debts by turning over to creditors land or
personal property; they had repealed the charter of an endowed college
and taken the management from the hands of the lawful trustees; and they
had otherwise interfered with the enforcement of private agreements. the
convention, taking notice of such matters, inserted a clause forbidding
states "to impair the obligation of contracts." the more venturous of
the radicals had in massachusetts raised the standard of revolt against
the authorities of the state. the convention answered by a brief
sentence to the effect that the president of the united states, to be
equipped with a regular army, would send troops to suppress domestic
insurrections whenever called upon by the legislature or, if it was not
in session, by the governor of the state. to make sure that the
restrictions on the states would not be dead letters, the federal
constitution, laws, and treaties were made the supreme law of the land,
to be enforced whenever necessary by a national judiciary and executive
against violations on the part of any state authorities.

=provisions for ratification and amendment.=--when the frame of
government had been determined, the powers to be vested in it had been
enumerated, and the restrictions upon the states had been written into
the bond, there remained three final questions. how shall the
constitution be ratified? what number of states shall be necessary to
put it into effect? how shall it be amended in the future?

on the first point, the mandate under which the convention was sitting
seemed positive. the articles of confederation were still in effect.
they provided that amendments could be made only by unanimous adoption
in congress and the approval of all the states. as if to give force to
this provision of law, the call for the convention had expressly stated
that all alterations and revisions should be reported to congress for
adoption or rejection, congress itself to transmit the document
thereafter to the states for their review.

to have observed the strict letter of the law would have defeated the
purposes of the delegates, because congress and the state legislatures
were openly hostile to such drastic changes as had been made. unanimous
ratification, as events proved, would have been impossible. therefore
the delegates decided that the constitution should be sent to congress
with the recommendation that it, in turn, transmit the document, not to
the state legislatures, but to conventions held in the states for the
special object of deciding upon ratification. this process was followed.
it was their belief that special conventions would be more friendly than
the state legislatures.

the convention was equally positive in dealing with the problem of the
number of states necessary to establish the new constitution. attempts
to change the articles had failed because amendment required the
approval of every state and there was always at least one recalcitrant
member of the union. the opposition to a new constitution was
undoubtedly formidable. rhode island had even refused to take part in
framing it, and her hostility was deep and open. so the convention cast
aside the provision of the articles of confederation which required
unanimous approval for any change in the plan of government; it decreed
that the new constitution should go into effect when ratified by nine
states.

in providing for future changes in the constitution itself the
convention also thrust aside the old rule of unanimous approval, and
decided that an amendment could be made on a two-thirds vote in both
houses of congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. this
change was of profound significance. every state agreed to be bound in
the future by amendments duly adopted even in case it did not approve
them itself. america in this way set out upon the high road that led
from a league of states to a nation.


the struggle over ratification

on september 17, 1787, the constitution, having been finally drafted in
clear and simple language, a model to all makers of fundamental law, was
adopted. the convention, after nearly four months of debate in secret
session, flung open the doors and presented to the americans the
finished plan for the new government. then the great debate passed to
the people.

=the opposition.=--storms of criticism at once descended upon the
constitution. "fraudulent usurpation!" exclaimed gerry, who had refused
to sign it. "a monster" out of the "thick veil of secrecy," declaimed a
pennsylvania newspaper. "an iron-handed despotism will be the result,"
protested a third. "we, 'the low-born,'" sarcastically wrote a fourth,
"will now admit the 'six hundred well-born' immediately to establish
this most noble, most excellent, and truly divine constitution." the
president will become a king; congress will be as tyrannical as
parliament in the old days; the states will be swallowed up; the rights
of the people will be trampled upon; the poor man's justice will be lost
in the endless delays of the federal courts--such was the strain of the
protests against ratification.

[illustration: an advertisement of _the federalist_]

=defense of the constitution.=--moved by the tempest of opposition,
hamilton, madison, and jay took up their pens in defense of the
constitution. in a series of newspaper articles they discussed and
expounded with eloquence, learning, and dignity every important clause
and provision of the proposed plan. these papers, afterwards collected
and published in a volume known as _the federalist_, form the finest
textbook on the constitution that has ever been printed. it takes its
place, moreover, among the wisest and weightiest treatises on government
ever written in any language in any time. other men, not so gifted, were
no less earnest in their support of ratification. in private
correspondence, editorials, pamphlets, and letters to the newspapers,
they urged their countrymen to forget their partisanship and accept a
constitution which, in spite of any defects great or small, was the
only guarantee against dissolution and warfare at home and dishonor and
weakness abroad.

[illustration: celebrating the ratification]

=the action of the state conventions.=--before the end of the year,
1787, three states had ratified the constitution: delaware and new
jersey unanimously and pennsylvania after a short, though savage,
contest. connecticut and georgia followed early the next year. then came
the battle royal in massachusetts, ending in ratification in february by
the narrow margin of 187 votes to 168. in the spring came the news that
maryland and south carolina were "under the new roof." on june 21, new
hampshire, where the sentiment was at first strong enough to defeat the
constitution, joined the new republic, influenced by the favorable
decision in massachusetts. swift couriers were sent to carry the news to
new york and virginia, where the question of ratification was still
undecided. nine states had accepted it and were united, whether more saw
fit to join or not.

meanwhile, however, virginia, after a long and searching debate, had
given her approval by a narrow margin, leaving new york as the next seat
of anxiety. in that state the popular vote for the delegates to the
convention had been clearly and heavily against ratification. events
finally demonstrated the futility of resistance, and hamilton by good
judgment and masterly arguments was at last able to marshal a majority
of thirty to twenty-seven votes in favor of ratification.

the great contest was over. all the states, except north carolina and
rhode island, had ratified. "the sloop anarchy," wrote an ebullient
journalist, "when last heard from was ashore on union rocks."

=the first election.=--in the autumn of 1788, elections were held to
fill the places in the new government. public opinion was overwhelmingly
in favor of washington as the first president. yielding to the
importunities of friends, he accepted the post in the spirit of public
service. on april 30, 1789, he took the oath of office at federal hall
in new york city. "long live george washington, president of the united
states!" cried chancellor livingston as soon as the general had kissed
the bible. the cry was caught by the assembled multitude and given back.
a new experiment in popular government was launched.

chapter viii

the clash of political parties


the men and measures of the new government

=friends of the constitution in power.=--in the first congress that
assembled after the adoption of the constitution, there were eleven
senators, led by robert morris, the financier, who had been delegates to
the national convention. several members of the house of
representatives, headed by james madison, had also been at philadelphia
in 1787. in making his appointments, washington strengthened the new
system of government still further by a judicious selection of
officials. he chose as secretary of the treasury, alexander hamilton,
who had been the most zealous for its success; general knox, head of the
war department, and edmund randolph, the attorney-general, were likewise
conspicuous friends of the experiment. every member of the federal
judiciary whom washington appointed, from the chief justice, john jay,
down to the justices of the district courts, had favored the
ratification of the constitution; and a majority of them had served as
members of the national convention that framed the document or of the
state ratifying conventions. only one man of influence in the new
government, thomas jefferson, the secretary of state, was reckoned as a
doubter in the house of the faithful. he had expressed opinions both for
and against the constitution; but he had been out of the country acting
as the minister at paris when the constitution was drafted and ratified.

=an opposition to conciliate.=--the inauguration of washington amid the
plaudits of his countrymen did not set at rest all the political turmoil
which had been aroused by the angry contest over ratification. "the
interesting nature of the question," wrote john marshall, "the equality
of the parties, the animation produced inevitably by ardent debate had a
necessary tendency to embitter the dispositions of the vanquished and to
fix more deeply in many bosoms their prejudices against a plan of
government in opposition to which all their passions were enlisted." the
leaders gathered around washington were well aware of the excited state
of the country. they saw rhode island and north carolina still outside
of the union.[1] they knew by what small margins the constitution had
been approved in the great states of massachusetts, virginia, and new
york. they were equally aware that a majority of the state conventions,
in yielding reluctant approval to the constitution, had drawn a number
of amendments for immediate submission to the states.

=the first amendments--a bill of rights.=--to meet the opposition,
madison proposed, and the first congress adopted, a series of amendments
to the constitution. ten of them were soon ratified and became in 1791 a
part of the law of the land. these amendments provided, among other
things, that congress could make no law respecting the establishment of
religion, abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right
of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for a
redress of grievances. they also guaranteed indictment by grand jury and
trial by jury for all persons charged by federal officers with serious
crimes. to reassure those who still feared that local rights might be
invaded by the federal government, the tenth amendment expressly
provided that the powers not delegated to the united states by the
constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the
states respectively or to the people. seven years later, the eleventh
amendment was written in the same spirit as the first ten, after a
heated debate over the action of the supreme court in permitting a
citizen to bring a suit against "the sovereign state" of georgia. the
new amendment was designed to protect states against the federal
judiciary by forbidding it to hear any case in which a state was sued by
a citizen.

=funding the national debt.=--paper declarations of rights, however,
paid no bills. to this task hamilton turned all his splendid genius. at
the very outset he addressed himself to the problem of the huge public
debt, daily mounting as the unpaid interest accumulated. in a _report on
public credit_ under date of january 9, 1790, one of the first and
greatest of american state papers, he laid before congress the outlines
of his plan. he proposed that the federal government should call in all
the old bonds, certificates of indebtedness, and other promises to pay
which had been issued by the congress since the beginning of the
revolution. these national obligations, he urged, should be put into one
consolidated debt resting on the credit of the united states; to the
holders of the old paper should be issued new bonds drawing interest at
fixed rates. this process was called "funding the debt." such a
provision for the support of public credit, hamilton insisted, would
satisfy creditors, restore landed property to its former value, and
furnish new resources to agriculture and commerce in the form of credit
and capital.

=assumption and funding of state debts.=--hamilton then turned to the
obligations incurred by the several states in support of the revolution.
these debts he proposed to add to the national debt. they were to be
"assumed" by the united states government and placed on the same secure
foundation as the continental debt. this measure he defended not merely
on grounds of national honor. it would, as he foresaw, give strength to
the new national government by making all public creditors, men of
substance in their several communities, look to the federal, rather than
the state government, for the satisfaction of their claims.

=funding at face value.=--on the question of the terms of consolidation,
assumption, and funding, hamilton had a firm conviction. that millions
of dollars' worth of the continental and state bonds had passed out of
the hands of those who had originally subscribed their funds to the
support of the government or had sold supplies for the revolutionary
army was well known. it was also a matter of common knowledge that a
very large part of these bonds had been bought by speculators at ruinous
figures--ten, twenty, and thirty cents on the dollar. accordingly, it
had been suggested, even in very respectable quarters, that a
discrimination should be made between original holders and speculative
purchasers. some who held this opinion urged that the speculators who
had paid nominal sums for their bonds should be reimbursed for their
outlays and the original holders paid the difference; others said that
the government should "scale the debt" by redeeming, not at full value
but at a figure reasonably above the market price. against the
proposition hamilton set his face like flint. he maintained that the
government was honestly bound to redeem every bond at its face value,
although the difficulty of securing revenue made necessary a lower rate
of interest on a part of the bonds and the deferring of interest on
another part.

=funding and assumption carried.=--there was little difficulty in
securing the approval of both houses of congress for the funding of the
national debt at full value. the bill for the assumption of state debts,
however, brought the sharpest division of opinions. to the southern
members of congress assumption was a gross violation of states' rights,
without any warrant in the constitution and devised in the interest of
northern speculators who, anticipating assumption and funding, had
bought up at low prices the southern bonds and other promises to pay.
new england, on the other hand, was strongly in favor of assumption;
several representatives from that section were rash enough to threaten a
dissolution of the union if the bill was defeated. to this dispute was
added an equally bitter quarrel over the location of the national
capital, then temporarily at new york city.

[illustration: first united states bank at philadelphia]

a deadlock, accompanied by the most surly feelings on both sides,
threatened the very existence of the young government. washington and
hamilton were thoroughly alarmed. hearing of the extremity to which the
contest had been carried and acting on the appeal from the secretary of
the treasury, jefferson intervened at this point. by skillful management
at a good dinner he brought the opposing leaders together; and thus once
more, as on many other occasions, peace was purchased and the union
saved by compromise. the bargain this time consisted of an exchange of
votes for assumption in return for votes for the capital. enough
southern members voted for assumption to pass the bill, and a majority
was mustered in favor of building the capital on the banks of the
potomac, after locating it for a ten-year period at philadelphia to
satisfy pennsylvania members.

=the united states bank.=--encouraged by the success of his funding and
assumption measures, hamilton laid before congress a project for a great
united states bank. he proposed that a private corporation be chartered
by congress, authorized to raise a capital stock of $10,000,000
(three-fourths in new six per cent federal bonds and one-fourth in
specie) and empowered to issue paper currency under proper safeguards.
many advantages, hamilton contended, would accrue to the government from
this institution. the price of the government bonds would be increased,
thus enhancing public credit. a national currency would be created of
uniform value from one end of the land to the other. the branches of the
bank in various cities would make easy the exchange of funds so vital to
commercial transactions on a national scale. finally, through the issue
of bank notes, the money capital available for agriculture and industry
would be increased, thus stimulating business enterprise. jefferson
hotly attacked the bank on the ground that congress had no power
whatever under the constitution to charter such a private corporation.
hamilton defended it with great cogency. washington, after weighing all
opinions, decided in favor of the proposal. in 1791 the bill
establishing the first united states bank for a period of twenty years
became a law.

=the protective tariff.=--a third part of hamilton's program was the
protection of american industries. the first revenue act of 1789, though
designed primarily to bring money into the empty treasury, declared in
favor of the principle. the following year washington referred to the
subject in his address to congress. thereupon hamilton was instructed to
prepare recommendations for legislative action. the result, after a
delay of more than a year, was his _report on manufactures_, another
state paper worthy, in closeness of reasoning and keenness of
understanding, of a place beside his report on public credit. hamilton
based his argument on the broadest national grounds: the protective
tariff would, by encouraging the building of factories, create a home
market for the produce of farms and plantations; by making the united
states independent of other countries in times of peace, it would double
its security in time of war; by making use of the labor of women and
children, it would turn to the production of goods persons otherwise
idle or only partly employed; by increasing the trade between the north
and south it would strengthen the links of union and add to political
ties those of commerce and intercourse. the revenue measure of 1792 bore
the impress of these arguments.


the rise of political parties

=dissensions over hamilton's measures.=--hamilton's plans, touching
deeply as they did the resources of individuals and the interests of the
states, awakened alarm and opposition. funding at face value, said his
critics, was a government favor to speculators; the assumption of state
debts was a deep design to undermine the state governments; congress had
no constitutional power to create a bank; the law creating the bank
merely allowed a private corporation to make paper money and lend it at
a high rate of interest; and the tariff was a tax on land and labor for
the benefit of manufacturers.

hamilton's reply to this bill of indictment was simple and
straightforward. some rascally speculators had profited from the funding
of the debt at face value, but that was only an incident in the
restoration of public credit. in view of the jealousies of the states it
was a good thing to reduce their powers and pretensions. the
constitution was not to be interpreted narrowly but in the full light of
national needs. the bank would enlarge the amount of capital so sorely
needed to start up american industries, giving markets to farmers and
planters. the tariff by creating a home market and increasing
opportunities for employment would benefit both land and labor. out of
such wise policies firmly pursued by the government, he concluded, were
bound to come strength and prosperity for the new government at home,
credit and power abroad. this view washington fully indorsed, adding
the weight of his great name to the inherent merits of the measures
adopted under his administration.

=the sharpness of the partisan conflict.=--as a result of the clash of
opinion, the people of the country gradually divided into two parties:
federalists and anti-federalists, the former led by hamilton, the latter
by jefferson. the strength of the federalists lay in the cities--boston,
providence, hartford, new york, philadelphia, charleston--among the
manufacturing, financial, and commercial groups of the population who
were eager to extend their business operations. the strength of the
anti-federalists lay mainly among the debt-burdened farmers who feared
the growth of what they called "a money power" and planters in all
sections who feared the dominance of commercial and manufacturing
interests. the farming and planting south, outside of the few towns,
finally presented an almost solid front against assumption, the bank,
and the tariff. the conflict between the parties grew steadily in
bitterness, despite the conciliatory and engaging manner in which
hamilton presented his cause in his state papers and despite the
constant efforts of washington to soften the asperity of the
contestants.

=the leadership and doctrines of jefferson.=--the party dispute had not
gone far before the opponents of the administration began to look to
jefferson as their leader. some of hamilton's measures he had approved,
declaring afterward that he did not at the time understand their
significance. others, particularly the bank, he fiercely assailed. more
than once, he and hamilton, shaking violently with anger, attacked each
other at cabinet meetings, and nothing short of the grave and dignified
pleas of washington prevented an early and open break between them. in
1794 it finally came. jefferson resigned as secretary of state and
retired to his home in virginia to assume, through correspondence and
negotiation, the leadership of the steadily growing party of opposition.

shy and modest in manner, halting in speech, disliking the turmoil of
public debate, and deeply interested in science and philosophy,
jefferson was not very well fitted for the strenuous life of political
contest. nevertheless, he was an ambitious and shrewd negotiator. he was
also by honest opinion and matured conviction the exact opposite of
hamilton. the latter believed in a strong, active, "high-toned"
government, vigorously compelling in all its branches. jefferson looked
upon such government as dangerous to the liberties of citizens and
openly avowed his faith in the desirability of occasional popular
uprisings. hamilton distrusted the people. "your people is a great
beast," he is reported to have said. jefferson professed his faith in
the people with an abandon that was considered reckless in his time.

on economic matters, the opinions of the two leaders were also
hopelessly at variance. hamilton, while cherishing agriculture, desired
to see america a great commercial and industrial nation. jefferson was
equally set against this course for his country. he feared the
accumulation of riches and the growth of a large urban working class.
the mobs of great cities, he said, are sores on the body politic;
artisans are usually the dangerous element that make revolutions;
workshops should be kept in europe and with them the artisans with their
insidious morals and manners. the only substantial foundation for a
republic, jefferson believed to be agriculture. the spirit of
independence could be kept alive only by free farmers, owning the land
they tilled and looking to the sun in heaven and the labor of their
hands for their sustenance. trusting as he did in the innate goodness of
human nature when nourished on a free soil, jefferson advocated those
measures calculated to favor agriculture and to enlarge the rights of
persons rather than the powers of government. thus he became the
champion of the individual against the interference of the government,
and an ardent advocate of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and
freedom of scientific inquiry. it was, accordingly, no mere factious
spirit that drove him into opposition to hamilton.

=the whisky rebellion.=--the political agitation of the anti-federalists
was accompanied by an armed revolt against the government in 1794. the
occasion for this uprising was another of hamilton's measures, a law
laying an excise tax on distilled spirits, for the purpose of increasing
the revenue needed to pay the interest on the funded debt. it so
happened that a very considerable part of the whisky manufactured in the
country was made by the farmers, especially on the frontier, in their
own stills. the new revenue law meant that federal officers would now
come into the homes of the people, measure their liquor, and take the
tax out of their pockets. all the bitterness which farmers felt against
the fiscal measures of the government was redoubled. in the western
districts of pennsylvania, virginia, and north carolina, they refused to
pay the tax. in pennsylvania, some of them sacked and burned the houses
of the tax collectors, as the revolutionists thirty years before had
mobbed the agents of king george sent over to sell stamps. they were in
a fair way to nullify the law in whole districts when washington called
out the troops to suppress "the whisky rebellion." then the movement
collapsed; but it left behind a deep-seated resentment which flared up
in the election of several obdurate anti-federalist congressmen from the
disaffected regions.


foreign influences and domestic politics

=the french revolution.=--in this exciting period, when all america was
distracted by partisan disputes, a storm broke in europe--the
epoch-making french revolution--which not only shook the thrones of the
old world but stirred to its depths the young republic of the new world.
the first scene in this dramatic affair occurred in the spring of 1789,
a few days after washington was inaugurated. the king of france, louis
xvi, driven into bankruptcy by extravagance and costly wars, was forced
to resort to his people for financial help. accordingly he called, for
the first time in more than one hundred fifty years, a meeting of the
national parliament, the "estates general," composed of representatives
of the "three estates"--the clergy, nobility, and commoners. acting
under powerful leaders, the commoners, or "third estate," swept aside
the clergy and nobility and resolved themselves into a national
assembly. this stirred the country to its depths.

[illustration: _from an old print_

louis xvi in the hands of the mob]

great events followed in swift succession. on july 14, 1789, the
bastille, an old royal prison, symbol of the king's absolutism, was
stormed by a paris crowd and destroyed. on the night of august 4, the
feudal privileges of the nobility were abolished by the national
assembly amid great excitement. a few days later came the famous
declaration of the rights of man, proclaiming the sovereignty of the
people and the privileges of citizens. in the autumn of 1791, louis xvi
was forced to accept a new constitution for france vesting the
legislative power in a popular assembly. little disorder accompanied
these startling changes. to all appearances a peaceful revolution had
stripped the french king of his royal prerogatives and based the
government of his country on the consent of the governed.

=american influence in france.=--in undertaking their great political
revolt the french had been encouraged by the outcome of the american
revolution. officers and soldiers, who had served in the american war,
reported to their french countrymen marvelous tales. at the frugal table
of general washington, in council with the unpretentious franklin, or at
conferences over the strategy of war, french noblemen of ancient lineage
learned to respect both the talents and the simple character of the
leaders in the great republican commonwealth beyond the seas. travelers,
who had gone to see the experiment in republicanism with their own eyes,
carried home to the king and ruling class stories of an astounding
system of popular government.

on the other hand the dalliance with american democracy was regarded by
french conservatives as playing with fire. "when we think of the false
ideas of government and philanthropy," wrote one of lafayette's aides,
"which these youths acquired in america and propagated in france with so
much enthusiasm and such deplorable success--for this mania of imitation
powerfully aided the revolution, though it was not the sole cause of
it--we are bound to confess that it would have been better, both for
themselves and for us, if these young philosophers in red-heeled shoes
had stayed at home in attendance on the court."

=early american opinion of the french revolution.=--so close were the
ties between the two nations that it is not surprising to find every
step in the first stages of the french revolution greeted with applause
in the united states. "liberty will have another feather in her cap,"
exultantly wrote a boston editor. "in no part of the globe," soberly
wrote john marshall, "was this revolution hailed with more joy than in
america.... but one sentiment existed." the main key to the bastille,
sent to washington as a memento, was accepted as "a token of the
victory gained by liberty." thomas paine saw in the great event "the
first ripe fruits of american principles transplanted into europe."
federalists and anti-federalists regarded the new constitution of france
as another vindication of american ideals.

=the reign of terror.=--while profuse congratulations were being
exchanged, rumors began to come that all was not well in france. many
noblemen, enraged at the loss of their special privileges, fled into
germany and plotted an invasion of france to overthrow the new system of
government. louis xvi entered into negotiations with his brother
monarchs on the continent to secure their help in the same enterprise,
and he finally betrayed to the french people his true sentiments by
attempting to escape from his kingdom, only to be captured and taken
back to paris in disgrace.

a new phase of the revolution now opened. the working people, excluded
from all share in the government by the first french constitution,
became restless, especially in paris. assembling on the champs de mars,
a great open field, they signed a petition calling for another
constitution giving them the suffrage. when told to disperse, they
refused and were fired upon by the national guard. this "massacre," as
it was called, enraged the populace. a radical party, known as
"jacobins," then sprang up, taking its name from a jacobin monastery in
which it held its sessions. in a little while it became the master of
the popular convention convoked in september, 1792. the monarchy was
immediately abolished and a republic established. on january 21, 1793,
louis was sent to the scaffold. to the war on austria, already raging,
was added a war on england. then came the reign of terror, during which
radicals in possession of the convention executed in large numbers
counter-revolutionists and those suspected of sympathy with the
monarchy. they shot down peasants who rose in insurrection against their
rule and established a relentless dictatorship. civil war followed.
terrible atrocities were committed on both sides in the name of liberty,
and in the name of monarchy. to americans of conservative temper it now
seemed that the revolution, so auspiciously begun, had degenerated into
anarchy and mere bloodthirsty strife.

=burke summons the world to war on france.=--in england, edmund burke
led the fight against the new french principles which he feared might
spread to all europe. in his _reflections on the french revolution_,
written in 1790, he attacked with terrible wrath the whole program of
popular government; he called for war, relentless war, upon the french
as monsters and outlaws; he demanded that they be reduced to order by
the restoration of the king to full power under the protection of the
arms of european nations.

=paine's defense of the french revolution.=--to counteract the campaign
of hate against the french, thomas paine replied to burke in another of
his famous tracts, _the rights of man_, which was given to the american
public in an edition containing a letter of approval from jefferson.
burke, said paine, had been mourning about the glories of the french
monarchy and aristocracy but had forgotten the starving peasants and the
oppressed people; had wept over the plumage and neglected the dying
bird. burke had denied the right of the french people to choose their
own governors, blandly forgetting that the english government in which
he saw final perfection itself rested on two revolutions. he had boasted
that the king of england held his crown in contempt of the democratic
societies. paine answered: "if i ask a man in america if he wants a
king, he retorts and asks me if i take him for an idiot." to the charge
that the doctrines of the rights of man were "new fangled," paine
replied that the question was not whether they were new or old but
whether they were right or wrong. as to the french disorders and
difficulties, he bade the world wait to see what would be brought forth
in due time.

=the effect of the french revolution on american politics.=--the course
of the french revolution and the controversies accompanying it,
exercised a profound influence on the formation of the first political
parties in america. the followers of hamilton, now proud of the name
"federalists," drew back in fright as they heard of the cruel deeds
committed during the reign of terror. they turned savagely upon the
revolutionists and their friends in america, denouncing as "jacobin"
everybody who did not condemn loudly enough the proceedings of the
french republic. a massachusetts preacher roundly assailed "the
atheistical, anarchical, and in other respects immoral principles of the
french republicans"; he then proceeded with equal passion to attack
jefferson and the anti-federalists, whom he charged with spreading false
french propaganda and betraying america. "the editors, patrons, and
abettors of these vehicles of slander," he exclaimed, "ought to be
considered and treated as enemies to their country.... of all traitors
they are the most aggravatedly criminal; of all villains, they are the
most infamous and detestable."

the anti-federalists, as a matter of fact, were generally favorable to
the revolution although they deplored many of the events associated with
it. paine's pamphlet, indorsed by jefferson, was widely read. democratic
societies, after the fashion of french political clubs, arose in the
cities; the coalition of european monarchs against france was denounced
as a coalition against the very principles of republicanism; and the
execution of louis xvi was openly celebrated at a banquet in
philadelphia. harmless titles, such as "sir," "the honorable," and "his
excellency," were decried as aristocratic and some of the more excited
insisted on adopting the french title, "citizen," speaking, for example,
of "citizen judge" and "citizen toastmaster." pamphlets in defense of
the french streamed from the press, while subsidized newspapers kept the
propaganda in full swing.

=the european war disturbs american commerce.=--this battle of wits, or
rather contest in calumny, might have gone on indefinitely in america
without producing any serious results, had it not been for the war
between england and france, then raging. the english, having command of
the seas, claimed the right to seize american produce bound for french
ports and to confiscate american ships engaged in carrying french goods.
adding fuel to a fire already hot enough, they began to search american
ships and to carry off british-born sailors found on board american
vessels.

=the french appeal for help.=--at the same time the french republic
turned to the united states for aid in its war on england and sent over
as its diplomatic representative "citizen" genet, an ardent supporter of
the new order. on his arrival at charleston, he was greeted with fervor
by the anti-federalists. as he made his way north, he was wined and
dined and given popular ovations that turned his head. he thought the
whole country was ready to join the french republic in its contest with
england. genet therefore attempted to use the american ports as the base
of operations for french privateers preying on british merchant ships;
and he insisted that the united states was in honor bound to help france
under the treaty of 1778.

=the proclamation of neutrality and the jay treaty.=--unmoved by the

rising tide of popular sympathy for france, washington took a firm
course. he received genet coldly. the demand that the united states aid
france under the old treaty of alliance he answered by proclaiming the
neutrality of america and warning american citizens against hostile acts
toward either france or england. when genet continued to hold meetings,
issue manifestoes, and stir up the people against england, washington
asked the french government to recall him. this act he followed up by
sending the chief justice, john jay, on a pacific mission to england.

the result was the celebrated jay treaty of 1794. by its terms great
britain agreed to withdraw her troops from the western forts where they
had been since the war for independence and to grant certain slight
trade concessions. the chief sources of bitterness--the failure of the
british to return slaves carried off during the revolution, the seizure
of american ships, and the impressment of sailors--were not touched,
much to the distress of everybody in america, including loyal
federalists. nevertheless, washington, dreading an armed conflict with
england, urged the senate to ratify the treaty. the weight of his
influence carried the day.

at this, the hostility of the anti-federalists knew no bounds. jefferson
declared the jay treaty "an infamous act which is really nothing more
than an alliance between england and the anglo-men of this country,
against the legislature and the people of the united states." hamilton,
defending it with his usual courage, was stoned by a mob in new york and
driven from the platform with blood streaming from his face. jay was
burned in effigy. even washington was not spared. the house of
representatives was openly hostile. to display its feelings, it called
upon the president for the papers relative to the treaty negotiations,
only to be more highly incensed by his flat refusal to present them, on
the ground that the house did not share in the treaty-making power.

=washington retires from politics.=--such angry contests confirmed the
president in his slowly maturing determination to retire at the end of
his second term in office. he did not believe that a third term was
unconstitutional or improper; but, worn out by his long and arduous
labors in war and in peace and wounded by harsh attacks from former
friends, he longed for the quiet of his beautiful estate at mount
vernon.

in september, 1796, on the eve of the presidential election, washington
issued his farewell address, another state paper to be treasured and
read by generations of americans to come. in this address he directed
the attention of the people to three subjects of lasting interest. he
warned them against sectional jealousies. he remonstrated against the
spirit of partisanship, saying that in government "of the popular
character, in government purely elective, it is a spirit not to be
encouraged." he likewise cautioned the people against "the insidious
wiles of foreign influence," saying: "europe has a set of primary
interests which to us have none or a very remote relation. hence she
must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are
essentially foreign to our concerns. hence, therefore, it would be
unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary
vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions
of her friendships or enmities.... why forego the advantages of so
peculiar a situation?... it is our true policy to steer clear of
permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.... taking
care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on a
respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary
alliances for extraordinary emergencies."

=the campaign of 1796--adams elected.=--on hearing of the retirement of
washington, the anti-federalists cast off all restraints. in honor of
france and in opposition to what they were pleased to call the
monarchical tendencies of the federalists, they boldly assumed the name
"republican"; the term "democrat," then applied only to obscure and
despised radicals, had not come into general use. they selected
jefferson as their candidate for president against john adams, the
federalist nominee, and carried on such a spirited campaign that they
came within four votes of electing him.

the successful candidate, adams, was not fitted by training or opinion
for conciliating a determined opposition. he was a reserved and studious
man. he was neither a good speaker nor a skillful negotiator. in one of
his books he had declared himself in favor of "government by an
aristocracy of talents and wealth"--an offense which the republicans
never forgave. while john marshall found him "a sensible, plain, candid,
good-tempered man," jefferson could see in him nothing but a "monocrat"
and "anglo-man." had it not been for the conduct of the french
government, adams would hardly have enjoyed a moment's genuine
popularity during his administration.

=the quarrel with france.=--the french directory, the executive
department established under the constitution of 1795, managed, however,
to stir the anger of republicans and federalists alike. it regarded the
jay treaty as a rebuke to france and a flagrant violation of obligations
solemnly registered in the treaty of 1778. accordingly it refused to
receive the american minister, treated him in a humiliating way, and
finally told him to leave the country. overlooking this affront in his
anxiety to maintain peace, adams dispatched to france a commission of
eminent men with instructions to reach an understanding with the french
republic. on their arrival, they were chagrined to find, instead of a
decent reception, an indirect demand for an apology respecting the past
conduct of the american government, a payment in cash, and an annual
tribute as the price of continued friendship. when the news of this
affair reached president adams, he promptly laid it before congress,
referring to the frenchmen who had made the demands as "mr. x, mr. y,
and mr. z."

this insult, coupled with the fact that french privateers, like the
british, were preying upon american commerce, enraged even the
republicans who had been loudest in the profession of their french
sympathies. they forgot their wrath over the jay treaty and joined with
the federalists in shouting: "millions for defense, not a cent for
tribute!" preparations for war were made on every hand. washington was
once more called from mount vernon to take his old position at the head
of the army. indeed, fighting actually began upon the high seas and went
on without a formal declaration of war until the year 1800. by that time
the directory had been overthrown. a treaty was readily made with
napoleon, the first consul, who was beginning his remarkable career as
chief of the french republic, soon to be turned into an empire.

=alien and sedition laws.=--flushed with success, the federalists
determined, if possible, to put an end to radical french influence in
america and to silence republican opposition. they therefore passed two
drastic laws in the summer of 1798: the alien and sedition acts.

the first of these measures empowered the president to expel from the
country or to imprison any alien whom he regarded as "dangerous" or "had
reasonable grounds to suspect" of "any treasonable or secret
machinations against the government."

the second of the measures, the sedition act, penalized not only those
who attempted to stir up unlawful combinations against the government
but also every one who wrote, uttered, or published "any false,
scandalous, and malicious writing ... against the government of the
united states or either house of congress, or the president of the
united states, with intent to defame said government ... or to bring
them or either of them into contempt or disrepute." this measure was
hurried through congress in spite of the opposition and the clear
provision in the constitution that congress shall make no law abridging
the freedom of speech or of the press. even many federalists feared the
consequences of the action. hamilton was alarmed when he read the bill,
exclaiming: "let us not establish a tyranny. energy is a very different
thing from violence." john marshall told his friends in virginia that,
had he been in congress, he would have opposed the two bills because he
thought them "useless" and "calculated to create unnecessary discontents
and jealousies."

the alien law was not enforced; but it gave great offense to the irish
and french whose activities against the american government's policy
respecting great britain put them in danger of prison. the sedition law,
on the other hand, was vigorously applied. several editors of republican
newspapers soon found themselves in jail or broken by ruinous fines for
their caustic criticisms of the federalist president and his policies.
bystanders at political meetings, who uttered sentiments which, though
ungenerous and severe, seem harmless enough now, were hurried before
federalist judges and promptly fined and imprisoned. although the
prosecutions were not numerous, they aroused a keen resentment. the
republicans were convinced that their political opponents, having
saddled upon the country hamilton's fiscal system and the british
treaty, were bent on silencing all censure. the measures therefore had
exactly the opposite effect from that which their authors intended.
instead of helping the federalist party, they made criticism of it more
bitter than ever.

=the kentucky and virginia resolutions.=--jefferson was quick to take
advantage of the discontent. he drafted a set of resolutions declaring
the sedition law null and void, as violating the federal constitution.
his resolutions were passed by the kentucky legislature late in 1798,
signed by the governor, and transmitted to the other states for their
consideration. though receiving unfavorable replies from a number of
northern states, kentucky the following year reaffirmed its position and
declared that the nullification of all unconstitutional acts of congress
was the rightful remedy to be used by the states in the redress of
grievances. it thus defied the federal government and announced a
doctrine hostile to nationality and fraught with terrible meaning for
the future. in the neighboring state of virginia, madison led a movement
against the alien and sedition laws. he induced the legislature to pass
resolutions condemning the acts as unconstitutional and calling upon the
other states to take proper means to preserve their rights and the
rights of the people.

=the republican triumph in 1800.=--thus the way was prepared for the
election of 1800. the republicans left no stone unturned in their
efforts to place on the federalist candidate, president adams, all the
odium of the alien and sedition laws, in addition to responsibility for
approving hamilton's measures and policies. the federalists, divided in
councils and cold in their affection for adams, made a poor campaign.
they tried to discredit their opponents with epithets of "jacobins" and
"anarchists"--terms which had been weakened by excessive use. when the
vote was counted, it was found that adams had been defeated; while the
republicans had carried the entire south and new york also and secured
eight of the fifteen electoral votes cast by pennsylvania. "our beloved
adams will now close his bright career," lamented a federalist
newspaper. "sons of faction, demagogues and high priests of anarchy, now
you have cause to triumph!"

[illustration: _an old cartoon_

a quarrel between a federalist and a republican in the house of
representatives]

jefferson's election, however, was still uncertain. by a curious
provision in the constitution, presidential electors were required to
vote for two persons without indicating which office each was to fill,
the one receiving the highest number of votes to be president and the
candidate standing next to be vice president. it so happened that aaron
burr, the republican candidate for vice president, had received the same
number of votes as jefferson; as neither had a majority the election was
thrown into the house of representatives, where the federalists held the
balance of power. although it was well known that burr was not even a
candidate for president, his friends and many federalists began
intriguing for his election to that high office. had it not been for the
vigorous action of hamilton the prize might have been snatched out of
jefferson's hands. not until the thirty-sixth ballot on february 17,
1801, was the great issue decided in his favor.[2]

chapter ix

the jeffersonian republicans in power


republican principles and policies

=opposition to strong central government.=--cherishing especially the
agricultural interest, as jefferson said, the republicans were in the
beginning provincial in their concern and outlook. their attachment to
america was, certainly, as strong as that of hamilton; but they regarded
the state, rather than the national government, as the proper center of
power and affection. indeed, a large part of the rank and file had been
among the opponents of the constitution in the days of its adoption.
jefferson had entertained doubts about it and monroe, destined to be the
fifth president, had been one of the bitter foes of ratification. the
former went so far in the direction of local autonomy that he exalted
the state above the nation in the kentucky resolutions of 1798,
declaring the constitution to be a mere compact and the states competent
to interpret and nullify federal law. this was provincialism with a
vengeance. "it is jealousy, not confidence, which prescribes limited
constitutions," wrote jefferson for the kentucky legislature. jealousy
of the national government, not confidence in it--this is the ideal that
reflected the provincial and agricultural interest.

=republican simplicity.=--every act of the jeffersonian party during its
early days of power was in accord with the ideals of government which it
professed. it had opposed all pomp and ceremony, calculated to give
weight and dignity to the chief executive of the nation, as symbols of
monarchy and high prerogative. appropriately, therefore, jefferson's
inauguration on march 4, 1801, the first at the new capital at
washington, was marked by extreme simplicity. in keeping with this
procedure he quit the practice, followed by washington and adams, of
reading presidential addresses to congress in joint assembly and adopted
in its stead the plan of sending his messages in writing--a custom that
was continued unbroken until 1913 when president wilson returned to the
example set by the first chief magistrate.

=republican measures.=--the republicans had complained of a great
national debt as the source of a dangerous "money power," giving
strength to the federal government; accordingly they began to pay it off
as rapidly as possible. they had held commerce in low esteem and looked
upon a large navy as a mere device to protect it; consequently they
reduced the number of warships. they had objected to excise taxes,
particularly on whisky; these they quickly abolished, to the intense
satisfaction of the farmers. they had protested against the heavy cost
of the federal government; they reduced expenses by discharging hundreds
of men from the army and abolishing many offices.

they had savagely criticized the sedition law and jefferson refused to
enforce it. they had been deeply offended by the assault on freedom of
speech and press and they promptly impeached samuel chase, a justice of
the supreme court, who had been especially severe in his attacks upon
offenders under the sedition act. their failure to convict justice chase
by a narrow margin was due to no lack of zeal on their part but to the
federalist strength in the senate where the trial was held. they had
regarded the appointment of a large number of federal judges during the
last hours of adams' administration as an attempt to intrench
federalists in the judiciary and to enlarge the sphere of the national
government. accordingly, they at once repealed the act creating the new
judgeships, thus depriving the "midnight appointees" of their posts.
they had considered the federal offices, civil and military, as sources
of great strength to the federalists and jefferson, though committed to
the principle that offices should be open to all and distributed
according to merit, was careful to fill most of the vacancies as they
occurred with trusted republicans. to his credit, however, it must be
said that he did not make wholesale removals to find room for party
workers.

the republicans thus hewed to the line of their general policy of
restricting the weight, dignity, and activity of the national
government. yet there were no republicans, as the federalists asserted,
prepared to urge serious modifications in the constitution. "if there be
any among us who wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican
form," wrote jefferson in his first inaugural, "let them stand
undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may
be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it." after reciting the
fortunate circumstances of climate, soil, and isolation which made the
future of america so full of promise, jefferson concluded: "a wise and
frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another,
shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of
industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the
bread it has earned. this is the sum of good government; and this is
necessary to close the circle of our felicities."

in all this the republicans had not reckoned with destiny. in a few
short years that lay ahead it was their fate to double the territory of
the country, making inevitable a continental nation; to give the
constitution a generous interpretation that shocked many a federalist;
to wage war on behalf of american commerce; to reestablish the hated
united states bank; to enact a high protective tariff; to see their
federalist opponents in their turn discredited as nullifiers and
provincials; to announce high national doctrines in foreign affairs; and
to behold the constitution exalted and defended against the pretensions
of states by a son of old virginia, john marshall, chief justice of the
supreme court of the united states.


the republicans and the great west

=expansion and land hunger.=--the first of the great measures which
drove the republicans out upon this new national course--the purchase
of the louisiana territory--was the product of circumstances rather than
of their deliberate choosing. it was not the lack of land for his
cherished farmers that led jefferson to add such an immense domain to
the original possessions of the united states. in the northwest
territory, now embracing ohio, indiana, illinois, michigan, wisconsin,
and a portion of minnesota, settlements were mainly confined to the
north bank of the ohio river. to the south, in kentucky and tennessee,
where there were more than one hundred thousand white people who had
pushed over the mountains from virginia and the carolinas, there were
still wide reaches of untilled soil. the alabama and mississippi regions
were vast indian frontiers of the state of georgia, unsettled and almost
unexplored. even to the wildest imagination there seemed to be territory
enough to satisfy the land hunger of the american people for a century
to come.

=the significance of the mississippi river.=--at all events the east,
then the center of power, saw no good reason for expansion. the planters
of the carolinas, the manufacturers of pennsylvania, the importers of
new york, the shipbuilders of new england, looking to the seaboard and
to europe for trade, refinements, and sometimes their ideas of
government, were slow to appreciate the place of the west in national
economy. the better educated the easterners were, the less, it seems,
they comprehended the destiny of the nation. sons of federalist fathers
at williams college, after a long debate decided by a vote of fifteen to
one that the purchase of louisiana was undesirable.

on the other hand, the pioneers of kentucky, ohio, and tennessee,
unlearned in books, saw with their own eyes the resources of the
wilderness. many of them had been across the mississippi and had beheld
the rich lands awaiting the plow of the white man. down the great river
they floated their wheat, corn, and bacon to ocean-going ships bound for
the ports of the seaboard or for europe. the land journeys over the
mountain barriers with bulky farm produce, they knew from experience,
were almost impossible, and costly at best. nails, bolts of cloth, tea,
and coffee could go or come that way, but not corn and bacon. a free
outlet to the sea by the mississippi was as essential to the pioneers of
the kentucky region as the harbor of boston to the merchant princes of
that metropolis.

=louisiana under spanish rule.=--for this reason they watched with deep
solicitude the fortunes of the spanish king to whom, at the close of the
seven years' war, had fallen the louisiana territory stretching from new
orleans to the rocky mountains. while he controlled the mouth of the
mississippi there was little to fear, for he had neither the army nor
the navy necessary to resist any invasion of american trade. moreover,
washington had been able, by the exercise of great tact, to secure from
spain in 1795 a trading privilege through new orleans which satisfied
the present requirements of the frontiersmen even if it did not allay
their fears for the future. so things stood when a swift succession of
events altered the whole situation.

=louisiana transferred to france.=--in july, 1802, a royal order from
spain instructed the officials at new orleans to close the port to
american produce. about the same time a disturbing rumor, long current,
was confirmed--napoleon had coerced spain into returning louisiana to
france by a secret treaty signed in 1800. "the scalers of the alps and
conquerors of venice" now looked across the sea for new scenes of
adventure. the west was ablaze with excitement. a call for war ran
through the frontier; expeditions were organized to prevent the landing
of the french; and petitions for instant action flooded in upon
jefferson.

=jefferson sees the danger.=--jefferson, the friend of france and sworn
enemy of england, compelled to choose in the interest of america, never
winced. "the cession of louisiana and the floridas by spain to france,"
he wrote to livingston, the american minister in paris, "works sorely on
the united states. it completely reverses all the political relations of
the united states and will form a new epoch in our political course....
there is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our
natural and habitual enemy. it is new orleans through which the produce
of three-eighths of our territory must pass to market.... france,
placing herself in that door, assumes to us an attitude of defiance.
spain might have retained it quietly for years. her pacific
dispositions, her feeble state would induce her to increase our
facilities there.... not so can it ever be in the hands of france....
the day that france takes possession of new orleans fixes the sentence
which is to restrain her forever within her low water mark.... it seals
the union of the two nations who in conjunction can maintain exclusive
possession of the ocean. from that moment we must marry ourselves to the
british fleet and nation.... this is not a state of things we seek or
desire. it is one which this measure, if adopted by france, forces on us
as necessarily as any other cause by the laws of nature brings on its
necessary effect."

=louisiana purchased.=--acting on this belief, but apparently seeing
only the mississippi outlet at stake, jefferson sent his friend, james
monroe, to france with the power to buy new orleans and west florida.
before monroe arrived, the regular minister, livingston, had already
convinced napoleon that it would be well to sell territory which might
be wrested from him at any moment by the british sea power, especially
as the war, temporarily stopped by the peace of amiens, was once more
raging in europe. wise as he was in his day, livingston had at first no
thought of buying the whole louisiana country. he was simply dazed when
napoleon offered to sell the entire domain and get rid of the business
altogether. though staggered by the proposal, he and monroe decided to
accept. on april 30, they signed the treaty of cession, agreeing to pay
$11,250,000 in six per cent bonds and to discharge certain debts due
french citizens, making in all approximately fifteen millions. spain
protested, napoleon's brother fumed, french newspapers objected; but the
deed was done.

=jefferson and his constitutional scruples.=--when the news of this
extraordinary event reached the united states, the people were filled
with astonishment, and no one was more surprised than jefferson himself.
he had thought of buying new orleans and west florida for a small sum,
and now a vast domain had been dumped into the lap of the nation. he was
puzzled. on looking into the constitution he found not a line
authorizing the purchase of more territory and so he drafted an
amendment declaring "louisiana, as ceded by france,--a part of the
united states." he had belabored the federalists for piling up a big
national debt and he could hardly endure the thought of issuing more
bonds himself.

in the midst of his doubts came the news that napoleon might withdraw
from the bargain. thoroughly alarmed by that, jefferson pressed the
senate for a ratification of the treaty. he still clung to his original
idea that the constitution did not warrant the purchase; but he lamely
concluded: "if our friends shall think differently, i shall certainly
acquiesce with satisfaction; confident that the good sense of our
country will correct the evil of construction when it shall produce ill
effects." thus the stanch advocate of "strict interpretation" cut loose
from his own doctrine and intrusted the construction of the constitution
to "the good sense" of his countrymen.

=the treaty ratified.=--this unusual transaction, so favorable to the
west, aroused the ire of the seaboard federalists. some denounced it as
unconstitutional, easily forgetting hamilton's masterly defense of the
bank, also not mentioned in the constitution. others urged that, if "the
howling wilderness" ever should be settled, it would turn against the
east, form new commercial connections, and escape from federal control.
still others protested that the purchase would lead inevitably to the
dominance of a "hotch potch of wild men from the far west." federalists,
who thought "the broad back of america" could readily bear hamilton's
consolidated debt, now went into agonies over a bond issue of less than
one-sixth of that amount. but in vain. jefferson's party with a high
hand carried the day. the senate, after hearing the federalist protest,
ratified the treaty. in december, 1803, the french flag was hauled down
from the old government buildings in new orleans and the stars and
stripes were hoisted as a sign that the land of coronado, de soto,
marquette, and la salle had passed forever to the united states.

[illustration: the united states in 1805]

by a single stroke, the original territory of the united states was more
than doubled. while the boundaries of the purchase were uncertain, it is
safe to say that the louisiana territory included what is now arkansas,
missouri, iowa, oklahoma, kansas, nebraska, south dakota, and large
portions of louisiana, minnesota, north dakota, colorado, montana, and
wyoming. the farm lands that the friends of "a little america" on the
seacoast declared a hopeless wilderness were, within a hundred years,
fully occupied and valued at nearly seven billion dollars--almost five
hundred times the price paid to napoleon.

=western explorations.=--having taken the fateful step, jefferson wisely
began to make the most of it. he prepared for the opening of the new
country by sending the lewis and clark expedition to explore it,
discover its resources, and lay out an overland route through the
missouri valley and across the great divide to the pacific. the story of
this mighty exploit, which began in the spring of 1804 and ended in the
autumn of 1806, was set down with skill and pains in the journal of
lewis and clark; when published even in a short form, it invited the
forward-looking men of the east to take thought about the western
empire. at the same time zebulon pike, in a series of journeys, explored
the sources of the mississippi river and penetrated the spanish
territories of the far southwest. thus scouts and pioneers continued the
work of diplomats.


the republican war for commercial independence

=the english and french blockades.=--in addition to bringing louisiana
to the united states, the reopening of the european war in 1803, after a
short lull, renewed in an acute form the commercial difficulties that
had plagued the country all during the administrations of washington and
adams. the republicans were now plunged into the hornets' nest. the
party whose ardent spirits had burned jay in effigy, stoned hamilton for
defending his treaty, jeered washington's proclamation of neutrality,
and spoken bitterly of "timid traders," could no longer take refuge in
criticism. it had to act.

its troubles took a serious turn in 1806. england, in a determined
effort to bring france to her knees by starvation, declared the coast of
europe blockaded from brest to the mouth of the elbe river. napoleon
retaliated by his berlin decree of november, 1806, blockading the
british isles--a measure terrifying to american ship owners whose
vessels were liable to seizure by any french rover, though napoleon had
no navy to make good his proclamation. great britain countered with a
still more irritating decree--the orders in council of 1807. it modified
its blockade, but in so doing merely authorized american ships not
carrying munitions of war to complete their voyage to the continent, on
condition of their stopping at a british port, securing a license, and
paying a tax. this, responded napoleon, was the height of insolence, and
he denounced it as a gross violation of international law. he then
closed the circle of american troubles by issuing his milan decree of
december, 1807. this order declared that any ship which complied with
the british rules would be subject to seizure and confiscation by french
authorities.

=the impressment of seamen.=--that was not all. great britain, in dire
need of men for her navy, adopted the practice of stopping american
ships, searching them, and carrying away british-born sailors found on
board. british sailors were so badly treated, so cruelly flogged for
trivial causes, and so meanly fed that they fled in crowds to the
american marine. in many cases it was difficult to tell whether seamen
were english or american. they spoke the same language, so that language
was no test. rovers on the deep and stragglers in the ports of both
countries, they frequently had no papers to show their nativity.
moreover, great britain held to the old rule--"once an englishman,
always an englishman"--a doctrine rejected by the united states in
favor of the principle that a man could choose the nation to which he
would give allegiance. british sea captains, sometimes by mistake, and
often enough with reckless indifference, carried away into servitude in
their own navy genuine american citizens. the process itself, even when
executed with all the civilities of law, was painful enough, for it
meant that american ships were forced to "come to," and compelled to
rest submissively under british guns until the searching party had pried
into records, questioned seamen, seized and handcuffed victims. saints
could not have done this work without raising angry passions, and only
saints could have endured it with patience and fortitude.

had the enactment of the scenes been confined to the high seas and
knowledge of them to rumors and newspaper stories, american resentment
might not have been so intense; but many a search and seizure was made
in sight of land. british and french vessels patrolled the coasts,
firing on one another and chasing one another in american waters within
the three-mile limit. when, in the summer of 1807, the american frigate
_chesapeake_ refused to surrender men alleged to be deserters from king
george's navy, the british warship _leopard_ opened fire, killing three
men and wounding eighteen more--an act which even the british ministry
could hardly excuse. if the french were less frequently the offenders,
it was not because of their tenderness about american rights but because
so few of their ships escaped the hawk-eyed british navy to operate in
american waters.

=the losses in american commerce.=--this high-handed conduct on the part
of european belligerents was very injurious to american trade. by their
enterprise, american shippers had become the foremost carriers on the
atlantic ocean. in a decade they had doubled the tonnage of american
merchant ships under the american flag, taking the place of the french
marine when britain swept that from the seas, and supplying britain with
the sinews of war for the contest with the napoleonic empire. the
american shipping engaged in foreign trade embraced 363,110 tons in
1791; 669,921 tons in 1800; and almost 1,000,000 tons in 1810. such was
the enterprise attacked by the british and french decrees. american
ships bound for great britain were liable to be captured by french
privateers which, in spite of the disasters of the nile and trafalgar,
ranged the seas. american ships destined for the continent, if they
failed to stop at british ports and pay tribute, were in great danger of
capture by the sleepless british navy and its swarm of auxiliaries.
american sea captains who, in fear of british vengeance, heeded the
orders in council and paid the tax were almost certain to fall a prey to
french vengeance, for the french were vigorous in executing the milan
decree.

=jefferson's policy.=--the president's dilemma was distressing. both the
belligerents in europe were guilty of depredations on american commerce.
war on both of them was out of the question. war on france was
impossible because she had no territory on this side of the water which
could be reached by american troops and her naval forces had been
shattered at the battles of the nile and trafalgar. war on great
britain, a power which jefferson's followers feared and distrusted, was
possible but not inviting. jefferson shrank from it. a man of peace, he
disliked war's brazen clamor; a man of kindly spirit, he was startled at
the death and destruction which it brought in its train. so for the
eight years jefferson steered an even course, suggesting measure after
measure with a view to avoiding bloodshed. he sent, it is true,
commodore preble in 1803 to punish mediterranean pirates preying upon
american commerce; but a great war he evaded with passionate
earnestness, trying in its place every other expedient to protect
american rights.

=the embargo and non-intercourse acts.=--in 1806, congress passed and
jefferson approved a non-importation act closing american ports to
certain products from british dominions--a measure intended as a club
over the british government's head. this law, failing in its purpose,
jefferson proposed and congress adopted in december, 1807, the embargo
act forbidding all vessels to leave american harbors for foreign ports.
france and england were to be brought to terms by cutting off their
supplies.

the result of the embargo was pathetic. england and france refused to
give up search and seizure. american ship owners who, lured by huge
profits, had formerly been willing to take the risk were now restrained
by law to their home ports. every section suffered. the south and west
found their markets for cotton, rice, tobacco, corn, and bacon
curtailed. thus they learned by bitter experience the national
significance of commerce. ship masters, ship builders, longshoremen, and
sailors were thrown out of employment while the prices of foreign goods
doubled. those who obeyed the law were ruined; violators of the law
smuggled goods into canada and florida for shipment abroad.

jefferson's friends accepted the medicine with a wry face as the only
alternative to supine submission or open war. his opponents, without
offering any solution of their own, denounced it as a contemptible plan
that brought neither relief nor honor. beset by the clamor that arose on
all sides, congress, in the closing days of jefferson's administration,
repealed the embargo law and substituted a non-intercourse act
forbidding trade with england and france while permitting it with other
countries--a measure equally futile in staying the depredations on
american shipping.

=jefferson retires in favor of madison.=--jefferson, exhausted by
endless wrangling and wounded, as washington had been, by savage
criticism, welcomed march 4, 1809. his friends urged him to "stay by the
ship" and accept a third term. he declined, saying that election for
life might result from repeated reelection. in following washington's
course and defending it on principle, he set an example to all his
successors, making the "third term doctrine" a part of american
unwritten law.

his intimate friend, james madison, to whom he turned over the burdens
of his high office was, like himself, a man of peace. madison had been a
leader since the days of the revolution, but in legislative halls and
council chambers, not on the field of battle. small in stature,
sensitive in feelings, studious in habits, he was no man for the rough
and tumble of practical politics. he had taken a prominent and
distinguished part in the framing and the adoption of the constitution.
he had served in the first congress as a friend of hamilton's measures.
later he attached himself to jefferson's fortunes and served for eight
years as his first counselor, the secretary of state. the principles of
the constitution, which he had helped to make and interpret, he was now
as president called upon to apply in one of the most perplexing moments
in all american history. in keeping with his own traditions and
following in the footsteps of jefferson, he vainly tried to solve the
foreign problem by negotiation.

=the trend of events.=--whatever difficulties madison had in making up
his mind on war and peace were settled by events beyond his own control.
in the spring of 1811, a british frigate held up an american ship near
the harbor of new york and impressed a seaman alleged to be an american
citizen. burning with resentment, the captain of the _president_, an
american warship, acting under orders, poured several broadsides into
the _little belt_, a british sloop, suspected of being the guilty party.
the british also encouraged the indian chief tecumseh, who welded
together the indians of the northwest under british protection and gave
signs of restlessness presaging a revolt. this sent a note of alarm
along the frontier that was not checked even when, in november,
tecumseh's men were badly beaten at tippecanoe by william henry
harrison. the indians stood in the way of the advancing frontier, and it
seemed to the pioneers that, without support from the british in canada,
the red men would soon be subdued.

=clay and calhoun.=--while events were moving swiftly and rumors were
flying thick and fast, the mastery of the government passed from the
uncertain hands of madison to a party of ardent young men in congress,
dubbed "young republicans," under the leadership of two members destined
to be mighty figures in american history: henry clay of kentucky and
john c. calhoun of south carolina. the former contended, in a flair of
folly, that "the militia of kentucky alone are competent to place
montreal and upper canada at your feet." the latter with a light heart
spoke of conquering canada in a four weeks' campaign. "it must not be
inferred," says channing, "that in advocating conquest, the westerners
were actuated merely by desire for land; they welcomed war because they

thought it would be the easiest way to abate indian troubles. the
savages were supported by the fur-trading interests that centred at
quebec and london.... the southerners on their part wished for florida
and they thought that the conquest of canada would obviate some northern
opposition to this acquisition of slave territory." while clay and
calhoun, spokesmen of the west and south, were not unmindful of what
napoleon had done to american commerce, they knew that their followers
still remembered with deep gratitude the aid of the french in the war
for independence and that the embers of the old hatred for george iii,
still on the throne, could be readily blown into flame.

=madison accepts war as inevitable.=--the conduct of the british
ministers with whom madison had to deal did little to encourage him in
adhering to the policy of "watchful waiting." one of them, a high tory,
believed that all americans were alike "except that a few are less
knaves than others" and his methods were colored by his belief. on the
recall of this minister the british government selected another no less
high and mighty in his principles and opinions. so madison became
thoroughly discouraged about the outcome of pacific measures. when the
pressure from congress upon him became too heavy, he gave way, signing
on june 18, 1812, the declaration of war on great britain. in
proclaiming hostilities, the administration set forth the causes which
justified the declaration; namely, the british had been encouraging the
indians to attack american citizens on the frontier; they had ruined
american trade by blockades; they had insulted the american flag by
stopping and searching our ships; they had illegally seized american
sailors and driven them into the british navy.

=the course of the war.=--the war lasted for nearly three years without
bringing victory to either side. the surrender of detroit by general
hull to the british and the failure of the american invasion of canada
were offset by perry's victory on lake erie and a decisive blow
administered to british designs for an invasion of new york by way of
plattsburgh. the triumph of jackson at new orleans helped to atone for
the humiliation suffered in the burning of the capitol by the british.
the stirring deeds of the _constitution_, the _united states_, and the
_argus_ on the seas, the heroic death of lawrence and the victories of a
hundred privateers furnished consolation for those who suffered from the
iron blockade finally established by the british government when it came
to appreciate the gravity of the situation. while men love the annals of
the sea, they will turn to the running battles, the narrow escapes, and
the reckless daring of american sailors in that naval contest with great
britain.

all this was exciting but it was inconclusive. in fact, never was a
government less prepared than was that of the united states in 1812. it
had neither the disciplined troops, the ships of war, nor the supplies
required by the magnitude of the military task. it was fortune that
favored the american cause. great britain, harassed, worn, and
financially embarrassed by nearly twenty years of fighting in europe,
was in no mood to gather her forces for a titanic effort in america even
after napoleon was overthrown and sent into exile at elba in the spring
of 1814. war clouds still hung on the european horizon and the conflict
temporarily halted did again break out. to be rid of american anxieties
and free for european eventualities, england was ready to settle with
the united states, especially as that could be done without conceding
anything or surrendering any claims.

=the treaty of peace.=--both countries were in truth sick of a war that
offered neither glory nor profit. having indulged in the usual
diplomatic skirmishing, they sent representatives to ghent to discuss
terms of peace. after long negotiations an agreement was reached on
christmas eve, 1814, a few days before jackson's victory at new orleans.
when the treaty reached america the people were surprised to find that
it said nothing about the seizure of american sailors, the destruction
of american trade, the searching of american ships, or the support of
indians on the frontier. nevertheless, we are told, the people "passed
from gloom to glory" when the news of peace arrived. the bells were
rung; schools were closed; flags were displayed; and many a rousing
toast was drunk in tavern and private home. the rejoicing could
continue. with napoleon definitely beaten at waterloo in june, 1815,
great britain had no need to impress sailors, search ships, and
confiscate american goods bound to the continent. once more the terrible
sea power sank into the background and the ocean was again white with
the sails of merchantmen.


the republicans nationalized

=the federalists discredited.=--by a strange turn of fortune's wheel,
the party of hamilton, washington, adams, the party of the grand nation,
became the party of provincialism and nullification. new england,
finding its shipping interests crippled in the european conflict and
then penalized by embargoes, opposed the declaration of war on great
britain, which meant the completion of the ruin already begun. in the
course of the struggle, the federalist leaders came perilously near to
treason in their efforts to hamper the government of the united states;
and in their desperation they fell back upon the doctrine of
nullification so recently condemned by them when it came from kentucky.
the senate of massachusetts, while the war was in progress, resolved
that it was waged "without justifiable cause," and refused to approve
military and naval projects not connected with "the defense of our
seacoast and soil." a boston newspaper declared that the union was
nothing but a treaty among sovereign states, that states could decide
for themselves the question of obeying federal law, and that armed
resistance under the banner of a state would not be rebellion or
treason. the general assembly of connecticut reminded the administration
at washington that "the state of connecticut is a free, sovereign, and
independent state." gouverneur morris, a member of the convention which
had drafted the constitution, suggested the holding of another
conference to consider whether the northern states should remain in the
union.

[illustration: _from an old cartoon_

new england jumping into the hands of george iii]

in october, 1814, a convention of delegates from connecticut,
massachusetts, rhode island, and certain counties of new hampshire and
vermont was held at hartford, on the call of massachusetts. the counsels
of the extremists were rejected but the convention solemnly went on
record to the effect that acts of congress in violation of the
constitution are void; that in cases of deliberate, dangerous, and
palpable infractions the state is duty bound to interpose its authority
for the protection of its citizens; and that when emergencies occur the
states must be their own judges and execute their own decisions. thus
new england answered the challenge of calhoun and clay. fortunately its
actions were not as rash as its words. the hartford convention merely
proposed certain amendments to the constitution and adjourned. at the
close of the war, its proposals vanished harmlessly; but the men who
made them were hopelessly discredited.

=the second united states bank.=--in driving the federalists towards
nullification and waging a national war themselves, the republicans lost
all their old taint of provincialism. moreover, in turning to measures
of reconstruction called forth by the war, they resorted to the national
devices of the federalists. in 1816, they chartered for a period of
twenty years a second united states bank--the institution which
jefferson and madison once had condemned as unsound and
unconstitutional. the constitution remained unchanged; times and
circumstances had changed. calhoun dismissed the vexed question of
constitutionality with a scant reference to an ancient dispute, while
madison set aside his scruples and signed the bill.

=the protective tariff of 1816.=--the republicans supplemented the bank
by another federalist measure--a high protective tariff. clay viewed it
as the beginning of his "american system" of protection. calhoun
defended it on national principles. for this sudden reversal of policy
the young republicans were taunted by some of their older party
colleagues with betraying the "agricultural interest" that jefferson had
fostered; but calhoun refused to listen to their criticisms. "when the
seas are open," he said, "the produce of the south may pour anywhere
into the markets of the old world.... what are the effects of a war with
a maritime power--with england? our commerce annihilated ... our
agriculture cut off from its accustomed markets, the surplus of the
farmer perishes on his hands.... the recent war fell with peculiar
pressure on the growers of cotton and tobacco and the other great
staples of the country; and the same state of things will recur in the
event of another war unless prevented by the foresight of this body....
when our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection, as they soon
will be under the fostering care of the government, we shall no longer
experience these evils." with the republicans nationalized, the
federalist party, as an organization, disappeared after a crushing
defeat in the presidential campaign of 1816.

=monroe and the florida purchase.=--to the victor in that political
contest, james monroe of virginia, fell two tasks of national
importance, adding to the prestige of the whole country and deepening
the sense of patriotism that weaned men away from mere allegiance to
states. the first of these was the purchase of florida from spain. the
acquisition of louisiana let the mississippi flow "unvexed to the sea";
but it left all the states east of the river cut off from the gulf,
affording them ground for discontent akin to that which had moved the
pioneers of kentucky to action a generation earlier. the uncertainty as
to the boundaries of louisiana gave the united states a claim to west
florida, setting on foot a movement for occupation. the florida swamps
were a basis for indian marauders who periodically swept into the
frontier settlements, and hiding places for runaway slaves. thus the
sanction of international law was given to punitive expeditions into
alien territory.

the pioneer leaders stood waiting for the signal. it came. president
monroe, on the occasion of an indian outbreak, ordered general jackson
to seize the offenders, in the floridas, if necessary. the high-spirited
warrior, taking this as a hint that he was to occupy the coveted region,
replied that, if possession was the object of the invasion, he could
occupy the floridas within sixty days. without waiting for an answer to
this letter, he launched his expedition, and in the spring of 1818 was
master of the spanish king's domain to the south.

there was nothing for the king to do but to make the best of the
inevitable by ceding the floridas to the united states in return for
five million dollars to be paid to american citizens having claims
against spain. on washington's birthday, 1819, the treaty was signed. it
ceded the floridas to the united states and defined the boundary between
mexico and the united states by drawing a line from the mouth of the
sabine river in a northwesterly direction to the pacific. on this
occasion even monroe, former opponent of the constitution, forgot to
inquire whether new territory could be constitutionally acquired and
incorporated into the american union. the republicans seemed far away
from the days of "strict construction." and jefferson still lived!

=the monroe doctrine.=--even more effective in fashioning the national
idea was monroe's enunciation of the famous doctrine that bears his
name. the occasion was another european crisis. during the napoleonic
upheaval and the years of dissolution that ensued, the spanish colonies
in america, following the example set by their english neighbors in
1776, declared their independence. unable to conquer them alone, the
king of spain turned for help to the friendly powers of europe that
looked upon revolution and republics with undisguised horror.

_the holy alliance._--he found them prepared to view his case with
sympathy. three of them, austria, prussia, and russia, under the
leadership of the czar, alexander i, in the autumn of 1815, had entered
into a holy alliance to sustain by reciprocal service the autocratic
principle in government. although the effusive, almost maudlin, language
of the treaty did not express their purpose explicitly, the alliance was
later regarded as a mere union of monarchs to prevent the rise and
growth of popular government.

the american people thought their worst fears confirmed when, in 1822, a
conference of delegates from russia, austria, prussia, and france met at
verona to consider, among other things, revolutions that had just broken
out in spain and italy. the spirit of the conference is reflected in the
first article of the agreement reached by the delegates: "the high
contracting powers, being convinced that the system of representative
government is equally incompatible with the monarchical principle and
the maxim of the sovereignty of the people with the divine right,
mutually engage in the most solemn manner to use all their efforts to
put an end to the system of representative government in whatever
country it may exist in europe and to prevent its being introduced in
those countries where it is not yet known." the czar, who incidentally
coveted the west coast of north america, proposed to send an army to aid
the king of spain in his troubles at home, thus preparing the way for
intervention in spanish america. it was material weakness not want of
spirit, that prevented the grand union of monarchs from making open war
on popular government.

_the position of england._--unfortunately, too, for the holy alliance,
england refused to cooperate. english merchants had built up a large
trade with the independent latin-american colonies and they protested
against the restoration of spanish sovereignty, which meant a renewal of
spain's former trade monopoly. moreover, divine right doctrines had been
laid to rest in england and the representative principle thoroughly
established. already there were signs of the coming democratic flood
which was soon to carry the first reform bill of 1832, extending the
suffrage, and sweep on to even greater achievements. british statesmen,
therefore, had to be cautious. in such circumstances, instead of
cooperating with the autocrats of russia, austria, and prussia, they
turned to the minister of the united states in london. the british prime
minister, canning, proposed that the two countries join in declaring
their unwillingness to see the spanish colonies transferred to any other
power.

_jefferson's advice._--the proposal was rejected; but president monroe
took up the suggestion with madison and jefferson as well as with his
secretary of state, john quincy adams. they favored the plan. jefferson
said: "one nation, most of all, could disturb us in this pursuit [of
freedom]; she now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us in it. by
acceding to her proposition we detach her from the bands, bring her
mighty weight into the scale of free government and emancipate a
continent at one stroke.... with her on our side we need not fear the
whole world. with her then we should most sedulously cherish a cordial
friendship."

_monroe's statement of the doctrine._--acting on the advice of trusted
friends, president monroe embodied in his message to congress, on
december 2, 1823, a statement of principles now famous throughout the
world as the monroe doctrine. to the autocrats of europe he announced
that he would regard "any attempt on their part to extend their system
to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety."
while he did not propose to interfere with existing colonies dependent
on european powers, he ranged himself squarely on the side of those that
had declared their independence. any attempt by a european power to
oppress them or control their destiny in any manner he characterized as
"a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the united states."
referring in another part of his message to a recent claim which the
czar had made to the pacific coast, president monroe warned the old
world that "the american continents, by the free and independent
condition which they have assumed and maintained, are henceforth not to
be considered as subjects for future colonization by any european
powers." the effect of this declaration was immediate and profound. men
whose political horizon had been limited to a community or state were
led to consider their nation as a great power among the sovereignties of
the earth, taking its part in shaping their international relations.

=the missouri compromise.=--respecting one other important measure of
this period, the republicans also took a broad view of their obligations
under the constitution; namely, the missouri compromise. it is true,
they insisted on the admission of missouri as a slave state, balanced
against the free state of maine; but at the same time they assented to
the prohibition of slavery in the louisiana territory north of the line
36 o 30'. during the debate on the subject an extreme view had been
presented, to the effect that congress had no constitutional warrant for
abolishing slavery in the territories. the precedent of the northwest
ordinance, ratified by congress in 1789, seemed a conclusive answer from
practice to this contention; but monroe submitted the issue to his
cabinet, which included calhoun of south carolina, crawford of georgia,
and wirt of virginia, all presumably adherents to the jeffersonian
principle of strict construction. he received in reply a unanimous
verdict to the effect that congress did have the power to prohibit
slavery in the territories governed by it. acting on this advice he
approved, on march 6, 1820, the bill establishing freedom north of the
compromise line. this generous interpretation of the powers of congress
stood for nearly forty years, until repudiated by the supreme court in
the dred scott case.


the national decisions of chief justice marshall

=john marshall, the nationalist.=--the republicans in the lower ranges
of state politics, who did not catch the grand national style of their
leaders charged with responsibilities in the national field, were
assisted in their education by a federalist from the old dominion, john
marshall, who, as chief justice of the supreme court of the united
states from 1801 to 1835, lost no occasion to exalt the constitution
above the claims of the provinces. no differences of opinion as to his
political views have ever led even his warmest opponents to deny his
superb abilities or his sincere devotion to the national idea. all will
likewise agree that for talents, native and acquired, he was an ornament
to the humble democracy that brought him forth. his whole career was
american. born on the frontier of virginia, reared in a log cabin,
granted only the barest rudiments of education, inured to hardship and
rough life, he rose by masterly efforts to the highest judicial honor
america can bestow.

on him the bitter experience of the revolution and of later days made a
lasting impression. he was no "summer patriot." he had been a soldier in
the revolutionary army. he had suffered with washington at valley forge.
he had seen his comrades in arms starving and freezing because the
continental congress had neither the power nor the inclination to force
the states to do their full duty. to him the articles of confederation
were the symbol of futility. into the struggle for the formation of the
constitution and its ratification in virginia he had thrown himself with
the ardor of a soldier. later, as a member of congress, a representative
to france, and secretary of state, he had aided the federalists in
establishing the new government. when at length they were driven from
power in the executive and legislative branches of the government, he
was chosen for their last stronghold, the supreme court. by historic
irony he administered the oath of office to his bitterest enemy, thomas
jefferson; and, long after the author of the declaration of independence
had retired to private life, the stern chief justice continued to
announce the old federalist principles from the supreme bench.

[illustration: john marshall]

=marbury _vs._ madison--an act of congress annulled.=--he had been in
his high office only two years when he laid down for the first time in
the name of the entire court the doctrine that the judges have the power
to declare an act of congress null and void when in their opinion it
violates the constitution. this power was not expressly conferred on the
court. though many able men held that the judicial branch of the
government enjoyed it, the principle was not positively established
until 1803 when the case of marbury _vs._ madison was decided. in
rendering the opinion of the court, marshall cited no precedents. he
sought no foundations for his argument in ancient history. he rested it
on the general nature of the american system. the constitution, ran his
reasoning, is the supreme law of the land; it limits and binds all who
act in the name of the united states; it limits the powers of congress
and defines the rights of citizens. if congress can ignore its
limitations and trespass upon the rights of citizens, marshall argued,
then the constitution disappears and congress is supreme. since,
however, the constitution is supreme and superior to congress, it is the
duty of judges, under their oath of office, to sustain it against
measures which violate it. therefore, from the nature of the american
constitutional system the courts must declare null and void all acts
which are not authorized. "a law repugnant to the constitution," he
closed, "is void and the courts as well as other departments are bound
by that instrument." from that day to this the practice of federal and
state courts in passing upon the constitutionality of laws has remained
unshaken.

this doctrine was received by jefferson and many of his followers with
consternation. if the idea was sound, he exclaimed, "then indeed is our
constitution a complete _felo de se_ [legally, a suicide]. for,
intending to establish three departments, coordinate and independent
that they might check and balance one another, it has given, according
to this opinion, to one of them alone the right to prescribe rules for
the government of the others, and to that one, too, which is unelected
by and independent of the nation.... the constitution, on this
hypothesis, is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which
they may twist and shape into any form they please. it should be
remembered, as an axiom of eternal truth in politics, that whatever
power in any government is independent, is absolute also.... a judiciary
independent of a king or executive alone is a good thing; but
independence of the will of the nation is a solecism, at least in a
republican government." but marshall was mighty and his view prevailed,
though from time to time other men, clinging to jefferson's opinion,
likewise opposed the exercise by the courts of the high power of passing
upon the constitutionality of acts of congress.

=acts of state legislatures declared unconstitutional.=--had marshall
stopped with annulling an act of congress, he would have heard less
criticism from republican quarters; but, with the same firmness, he set
aside acts of state legislatures as well, whenever, in his opinion, they
violated the federal constitution. in 1810, in the case of fletcher
_vs._ peck, he annulled an act of the georgia legislature, informing the
state that it was not sovereign, but "a part of a large empire, ... a
member of the american union; and that union has a constitution ...
which imposes limits to the legislatures of the several states." in the
case of mcculloch _vs._ maryland, decided in 1819, he declared void an
act of the maryland legislature designed to paralyze the branches of the
united states bank established in that state. in the same year, in the
still more memorable dartmouth college case, he annulled an act of the
new hampshire legislature which infringed upon the charter received by
the college from king george long before. that charter, he declared, was
a contract between the state and the college, which the legislature
under the federal constitution could not impair. two years later he
stirred the wrath of virginia by summoning her to the bar of the supreme
court to answer in a case in which the validity of one of her laws was
involved and then justified his action in a powerful opinion rendered in
the case of cohens _vs._ virginia.

all these decisions aroused the legislatures of the states. they passed
sheaves of resolutions protesting and condemning; but marshall never
turned and never stayed. the constitution of the united states, he
fairly thundered at them, is the supreme law of the land; the supreme
court is the proper tribunal to pass finally upon the validity of the
laws of the states; and "those sovereignties," far from possessing the
right of review and nullification, are irrevocably bound by the
decisions of that court. this was strong medicine for the authors of the
kentucky and virginia resolutions and for the members of the hartford
convention; but they had to take it.

=the doctrine of implied powers.=--while restraining congress in the
marbury case and the state legislatures in a score of cases, marshall
also laid the judicial foundation for a broad and liberal view of the
constitution as opposed to narrow and strict construction. in mcculloch
_vs._ maryland, he construed generously the words "necessary and proper"
in such a way as to confer upon congress a wide range of "implied
powers" in addition to their express powers. that case involved, among
other things, the question whether the act establishing the second
united states bank was authorized by the constitution. marshall answered
in the affirmative. congress, ran his reasoning, has large powers over
taxation and the currency; a bank is of appropriate use in the exercise
of these enumerated powers; and therefore, though not absolutely
necessary, a bank is entirely proper and constitutional. "with respect
to the means by which the powers that the constitution confers are to be
carried into execution," he said, congress must be allowed the
discretion which "will enable that body to perform the high duties
assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people." in short,
the constitution of the united states is not a strait jacket but a
flexible instrument vesting in congress the powers necessary to meet
national problems as they arise. in delivering this opinion marshall
used language almost identical with that employed by lincoln when,
standing on the battle field of a war waged to preserve the nation, he
said that "a government of the people, by the people, for the people
shall not perish from the earth."


summary of the union and national politics

during the strenuous period between the establishment of american
independence and the advent of jacksonian democracy the great american
experiment was under the direction of the men who had launched it. all
the presidents in that period, except john quincy adams, had taken part
in the revolution. james madison, the chief author of the constitution,
lived until 1836. this age, therefore, was the "age of the fathers." it
saw the threatened ruin of the country under the articles of
confederation, the formation of the constitution, the rise of political
parties, the growth of the west, the second war with england, and the
apparent triumph of the national spirit over sectionalism.

the new republic had hardly been started in 1783 before its troubles
began. the government could not raise money to pay its debts or running
expenses; it could not protect american commerce and manufactures
against european competition; it could not stop the continual issues of
paper money by the states; it could not intervene to put down domestic
uprisings that threatened the existence of the state governments.
without money, without an army, without courts of law, the union under
the articles of confederation was drifting into dissolution. patriots,
who had risked their lives for independence, began to talk of monarchy
again. washington, hamilton, and madison insisted that a new
constitution alone could save america from disaster.

by dint of much labor the friends of a new form of government induced
the congress to call a national convention to take into account the
state of america. in may, 1787, it assembled at philadelphia and for
months it debated and wrangled over plans for a constitution. the small
states clamored for equal rights in the union. the large states vowed
that they would never grant it. a spirit of conciliation, fair play, and
compromise saved the convention from breaking up. in addition, there
were jealousies between the planting states and the commercial states.
here, too, compromises had to be worked out. some of the delegates
feared the growth of democracy and others cherished it. these factions
also had to be placated. at last a plan of government was drafted--the
constitution of the united states--and submitted to the states for
approval. only after a long and acrimonious debate did enough states
ratify the instrument to put it into effect. on april 30, 1789, george
washington was inaugurated first president.

the new government proceeded to fund the old debt of the nation, assume
the debts of the states, found a national bank, lay heavy taxes to pay
the bills, and enact laws protecting american industry and commerce.
hamilton led the way, but he had not gone far before he encountered
opposition. he found a formidable antagonist in jefferson. in time two
political parties appeared full armed upon the scene: the federalists
and the republicans. for ten years they filled the country with
political debate. in 1800 the federalists were utterly vanquished by the
republicans with jefferson in the lead.

by their proclamations of faith the republicans favored the states
rather than the new national government, but in practice they added
immensely to the prestige and power of the nation. they purchased
louisiana from france, they waged a war for commercial independence
against england, they created a second united states bank, they enacted
the protective tariff of 1816, they declared that congress had power to
abolish slavery north of the missouri compromise line, and they spread
the shield of the monroe doctrine between the western hemisphere and
europe.

still america was a part of european civilization. currents of opinion
flowed to and fro across the atlantic. friends of popular government in
europe looked to america as the great exemplar of their ideals. events
in europe reacted upon thought in the united states. the french
revolution exerted a profound influence on the course of political
debate. while it was in the stage of mere reform all americans favored
it. when the king was executed and a radical democracy set up, american
opinion was divided. when france fell under the military dominion of
napoleon and preyed upon american commerce, the united states made ready
for war.

the conduct of england likewise affected american affairs. in 1793 war
broke out between england and france and raged with only a slight
intermission until 1815. england and france both ravaged american
commerce, but england was the more serious offender because she had
command of the seas. though jefferson and madison strove for peace, the
country was swept into war by the vehemence of the "young republicans,"
headed by clay and calhoun.

when the armed conflict was closed, one in diplomacy opened. the
autocratic powers of europe threatened to intervene on behalf of spain
in her attempt to recover possession of her latin-american colonies.
their challenge to america brought forth the monroe doctrine. the powers
of europe were warned not to interfere with the independence or the
republican policies of this hemisphere or to attempt any new
colonization in it. it seemed that nationalism was to have a peaceful
triumph over sectionalism.

part iv. the west and jacksonian democracy




chapter x

the farmers beyond the appalachians


the nationalism of hamilton was undemocratic. the democracy of jefferson
was, in the beginning, provincial. the historic mission of uniting
nationalism and democracy was in the course of time given to new leaders
from a region beyond the mountains, peopled by men and women from all
sections and free from those state traditions which ran back to the
early days of colonization. the voice of the democratic nationalism
nourished in the west was heard when clay of kentucky advocated his
american system of protection for industries; when jackson of tennessee
condemned nullification in a ringing proclamation that has taken its
place among the great american state papers; and when lincoln of
illinois, in a fateful hour, called upon a bewildered people to meet the
supreme test whether this was a nation destined to survive or to perish.
and it will be remembered that lincoln's party chose for its banner that
earlier device--republican--which jefferson had made a sign of power.
the "rail splitter" from illinois united the nationalism of hamilton
with the democracy of jefferson, and his appeal was clothed in the
simple language of the people, not in the sonorous rhetoric which
webster learned in the schools.


preparation for western settlement

=the west and the american revolution.=--the excessive attention devoted
by historians to the military operations along the coast has obscured
the role played by the frontier in the american revolution. the action
of great britain in closing western land to easy settlement in 1763 was
more than an incident in precipitating the war for independence.
americans on the frontier did not forget it; when indians were employed
by england to defend that land, zeal for the patriot cause set the
interior aflame. it was the members of the western vanguard, like daniel
boone, john sevier, and george rogers clark, who first understood the
value of the far-away country under the guns of the english forts, where
the red men still wielded the tomahawk and the scalping knife. it was
they who gave the east no rest until their vision was seen by the
leaders on the seaboard who directed the course of national policy. it
was one of their number, a seasoned indian fighter, george rogers clark,
who with aid from virginia seized kaskaskia and vincennes and secured
the whole northwest to the union while the fate of washington's army was
still hanging in the balance.

=western problems at the end of the revolution.=--the treaty of peace,
signed with great britain in 1783, brought the definite cession of the
coveted territory west to the mississippi river, but it left unsolved
many problems. in the first place, tribes of resentful indians in the
ohio region, even though british support was withdrawn at last, had to
be reckoned with; and it was not until after the establishment of the
federal constitution that a well-equipped army could be provided to
guarantee peace on the border. in the second place, british garrisons
still occupied forts on lake erie pending the execution of the terms of
the treaty of 1783--terms which were not fulfilled until after the
ratification of the jay treaty twelve years later. in the third place,
virginia, connecticut, and massachusetts had conflicting claims to the
land in the northwest based on old english charters and indian treaties.
it was only after a bitter contest that the states reached an agreement
to transfer their rights to the government of the united states,
virginia executing her deed of cession on march 1, 1784. in the fourth
place, titles to lands bought by individuals remained uncertain in the
absence of official maps and records. to meet this last situation,
congress instituted a systematic survey of the ohio country, laying it
out into townships, sections of 640 acres each, and quarter sections. in
every township one section of land was set aside for the support of
public schools.

=the northwest ordinance.=--the final problem which had to be solved
before settlement on a large scale could be begun was that of governing
the territory. pioneers who looked with hungry eyes on the fertile
valley of the ohio could hardly restrain their impatience. soldiers of
the revolution, who had been paid for their services in land warrants
entitling them to make entries in the west, called for action.

congress answered by passing in 1787 the famous northwest ordinance
providing for temporary territorial government to be followed by the
creation of a popular assembly as soon as there were five thousand free
males in any district. eventual admission to the union on an equal
footing with the original states was promised to the new territories.
religious freedom was guaranteed. the safeguards of trial by jury,
regular judicial procedure, and _habeas corpus_ were established, in order
that the methods of civilized life might take the place of the
rough-and-ready justice of lynch law. during the course of the debate on
the ordinance, congress added the sixth article forbidding slavery and
involuntary servitude.

this charter of the northwest, so well planned by the congress under the
articles of confederation, was continued in force by the first congress
under the constitution in 1789. the following year its essential
provisions, except the ban on slavery, were applied to the territory
south of the ohio, ceded by north carolina to the national government,
and in 1798 to the mississippi territory, once held by georgia. thus it
was settled for all time that "the new colonies were not to be exploited
for the benefit of the parent states (any more than for the benefit of
england) but were to be autonomous and coordinate commonwealths." this
outcome, bitterly opposed by some eastern leaders who feared the triumph
of western states over the seaboard, completed the legal steps necessary
by way of preparation for the flood of settlers.

=the land companies, speculators, and western land tenure.=--as in the
original settlement of america, so in the opening of the west, great
companies and single proprietors of large grants early figured. in 1787
the ohio land company, a new england concern, acquired a million and a
half acres on the ohio and began operations by planting the town of
marietta. a professional land speculator, j.c. symmes, secured a million
acres lower down where the city of cincinnati was founded. other
individuals bought up soldiers' claims and so acquired enormous holdings
for speculative purposes. indeed, there was such a rush to make fortunes
quickly through the rise in land values that washington was moved to cry
out against the "rage for speculating in and forestalling of land on the
north west of the ohio," protesting that "scarce a valuable spot within
any tolerable distance of it is left without a claimant." he therefore
urged congress to fix a reasonable price for the land, not "too
exorbitant and burdensome for real occupiers, but high enough to
discourage monopolizers."

congress, however, was not prepared to use the public domain for the
sole purpose of developing a body of small freeholders in the west. it
still looked upon the sale of public lands as an important source of
revenue with which to pay off the public debt; consequently it thought
more of instant income than of ultimate results. it placed no limit on
the amount which could be bought when it fixed the price at $2 an acre
in 1796, and it encouraged the professional land operator by making the
first installment only twenty cents an acre in addition to the small
registration and survey fee. on such terms a speculator with a few
thousand dollars could get possession of an enormous plot of land. if he
was fortunate in disposing of it, he could meet the installments, which
were spread over a period of four years, and make a handsome profit for
himself. even when the credit or installment feature was abolished in
1821 and the price of the land lowered to a cash price of $1.75 an acre,
the opportunity for large speculative purchases continued to attract
capital to land ventures.

=the development of the small freehold.=--the cheapness of land and the
scarcity of labor, nevertheless, made impossible the triumph of the huge
estate with its semi-servile tenantry. for about $45 a man could get a
farm of 160 acres on the installment plan; another payment of $80 was
due in forty days; but a four-year term was allowed for the discharge of
the balance. with a capital of from two to three hundred dollars a
family could embark on a land venture. if it had good crops, it could
meet the deferred payments. it was, however, a hard battle at best. many
a man forfeited his land through failure to pay the final installment;
yet in the end, in spite of all the handicaps, the small freehold of a
few hundred acres at most became the typical unit of western
agriculture, except in the planting states of the gulf. even the lands
of the great companies were generally broken up and sold in small lots.

the tendency toward moderate holdings, so favored by western conditions,
was also promoted by a clause in the northwest ordinance declaring that
the land of any person dying intestate--that is, without any will
disposing of it--should be divided equally among his descendants.
hildreth says of this provision: "it established the important
republican principle, not then introduced into all the states, of the
equal distribution of landed as well as personal property." all these
forces combined made the wide dispersion of wealth, in the early days of
the nineteenth century, an american characteristic, in marked contrast
with the european system of family prestige and vast estates based on
the law of primogeniture.


the western migration and new states

=the people.=--with government established, federal arms victorious over
the indians, and the lands surveyed for sale, the way was prepared for
the immigrants. they came with a rush. young new englanders, weary of
tilling the stony soil of their native states, poured through new york
and pennsylvania, some settling on the northern bank of the ohio but
most of them in the lake region. sons and daughters of german farmers in
pennsylvania and many a redemptioner who had discharged his bond of
servitude pressed out into ohio, kentucky, tennessee, or beyond. from
the exhausted fields and the clay hills of the southern states came
pioneers of english and scotch-irish descent, the latter in great
numbers. indeed one historian of high authority has ventured to say that
"the rapid expansion of the united states from a coast strip to a
continental area is largely a scotch-irish achievement." while native
americans of mixed stocks led the way into the west, it was not long
before immigrants direct from europe, under the stimulus of company
enterprise, began to filter into the new settlements in increasing
numbers.

the types of people were as various as the nations they represented.
timothy flint, who published his entertaining _recollections_ in 1826,
found the west a strange mixture of all sorts and conditions of people.
some of them, he relates, had been hunters in the upper world of the
mississippi, above the falls of st. anthony. some had been still farther
north, in canada. still others had wandered from the south--the gulf of
mexico, the red river, and the spanish country. french boatmen and
trappers, spanish traders from the southwest, virginia planters with
their droves of slaves mingled with english, german, and scotch-irish
farmers. hunters, forest rangers, restless bordermen, and squatters,
like the foaming combers of an advancing tide, went first. then followed
the farmers, masters of the ax and plow, with their wives who shared
every burden and hardship and introduced some of the features of
civilized life. the hunters and rangers passed on to new scenes; the
home makers built for all time.

=the number of immigrants.=--there were no official stations on the
frontier to record the number of immigrants who entered the west during
the decades following the american revolution. but travelers of the time
record that every road was "crowded" with pioneers and their families,
their wagons and cattle; and that they were seldom out of the sound of
the snapping whip of the teamster urging forward his horses or the crack
of the hunter's rifle as he brought down his evening meal. "during the
latter half of 1787," says coman, "more than nine hundred boats floated
down the ohio carrying eighteen thousand men, women, and children, and
twelve thousand horses, sheep, and cattle, and six hundred and fifty
wagons." other lines of travel were also crowded and with the passing
years the flooding tide of home seekers rose higher and higher.

=the western routes.=--four main routes led into the country beyond the
appalachians. the genesee road, beginning at albany, ran almost due west
to the present site of buffalo on lake erie, through a level country. in
the dry season, wagons laden with goods could easily pass along it into
northern ohio. a second route, through pittsburgh, was fed by three
eastern branches, one starting at philadelphia, one at baltimore, and
another at alexandria. a third main route wound through the mountains
from alexandria to boonesboro in kentucky and then westward across the
ohio to st. louis. a fourth, the most famous of them all, passed through
the cumberland gap and by branches extended into the cumberland valley
and the kentucky country.

of these four lines of travel, the pittsburgh route offered the most
advantages. pioneers, no matter from what section they came, when once
they were on the headwaters of the ohio and in possession of a flatboat,
could find a quick and easy passage into all parts of the west and
southwest. whether they wanted to settle in ohio, kentucky, or western
tennessee they could find their way down the drifting flood to their
destination or at least to some spot near it. many people from the south
as well as the northern and middle states chose this route; so it came
about that the sons and daughters of virginia and the carolinas mingled
with those of new york, pennsylvania, and new england in the settlement
of the northwest territory.

=the methods of travel into the west.=--many stories giving exact
descriptions of methods of travel into the west in the early days have
been preserved. the country was hardly opened before visitors from the
old world and from the eastern states, impelled by curiosity, made their
way to the very frontier of civilization and wrote books to inform or
amuse the public. one of them, gilbert imlay, an english traveler, has
given us an account of the pittsburgh route as he found it in 1791. "if
a man ... " he writes, "has a family or goods of any sort to remove, his
best way, then, would be to purchase a waggon and team of horses to
carry his property to redstone old fort or to pittsburgh, according as
he may come from the northern or southern states. a good waggon will
cost, at philadelphia, about $10 ... and the horses about $12 each; they
would cost something more both at baltimore and alexandria. the waggon
may be covered with canvass, and if it is the choice of the people, they
may sleep in it of nights with the greatest safety. but if they dislike
that, there are inns of accommodation the whole distance on the
different roads.... the provisions i would purchase in the same manner
[that is, from the farmers along the road]; and by having two or three
camp kettles and stopping every evening when the weather is fine upon
the brink of some rivulet and by kindling a fire they may soon dress
their own food.... this manner of journeying is so far from being
disagreeable that in a fine season it is extremely pleasant." the
immigrant once at pittsburgh or wheeling could then buy a flatboat of a
size required for his goods and stock, and drift down the current to his
journey's end.

[illustration: roads and trails into the western territory]

=the admission of kentucky and tennessee.=--when the eighteenth century
drew to a close, kentucky had a population larger than delaware, rhode
island, or new hampshire. tennessee claimed 60,000 inhabitants. in 1792
kentucky took her place as a state beside her none too kindly parent,
virginia. the eastern federalists resented her intrusion; but they took
some consolation in the admission of vermont because the balance of
eastern power was still retained.

as if to assert their independence of old homes and conservative ideas
the makers of kentucky's first constitution swept aside the landed
qualification on the suffrage and gave the vote to all free white males.
four years later, kentucky's neighbor to the south, tennessee, followed
this step toward a wider democracy. after encountering fierce opposition
from the federalists, tennessee was accepted as the sixteenth state.

=ohio.=--the door of the union had hardly opened for tennessee when
another appeal was made to congress, this time from the pioneers in
ohio. the little posts founded at marietta and cincinnati had grown into
flourishing centers of trade. the stream of immigrants, flowing down the
river, added daily to their numbers and the growing settlements all
around poured produce into their markets to be exchanged for "store
goods." after the indians were disposed of in 1794 and the last british
soldier left the frontier forts under the terms of the jay treaty of
1795, tiny settlements of families appeared on lake erie in the "western
reserve," a region that had been retained by connecticut when she
surrendered her other rights in the northwest.

at the close of the century, ohio, claiming a population of more than
50,000, grew discontented with its territorial status. indeed, two years
before the enactment of the northwest ordinance, squatters in that
region had been invited by one john emerson to hold a convention after
the fashion of the men of hartford, windsor, and wethersfield in old
connecticut and draft a frame of government for themselves. this true
son of new england declared that men "have an undoubted right to pass
into every vacant country and there to form their constitution and that
from the confederation of the whole united states congress is not
empowered to forbid them." this grand convention was never held because
the heavy hand of the government fell upon the leaders; but the spirit
of john emerson did not perish. in november, 1802, a convention chosen
by voters, assembled under the authority of congress at chillicothe,
drew up a constitution. it went into force after a popular ratification.
the roll of the convention bore such names as abbot, baldwin, cutler,
huntington, putnam, and sargent, and the list of counties from which
they came included adams, fairfield, hamilton, jefferson, trumbull, and
washington, showing that the new america in the west was peopled and led
by the old stock. in 1803 ohio was admitted to the union.

=indiana and illinois.=--as in the neighboring state, the frontier in
indiana advanced northward from the ohio, mainly under the leadership,
however, of settlers from the south--restless kentuckians hoping for
better luck in a newer country and pioneers from the far frontiers of
virginia and north carolina. as soon as a tier of counties swinging
upward like the horns of the moon against ohio on the east and in the
wabash valley on the west was fairly settled, a clamor went up for
statehood. under the authority of an act of congress in 1816 the
indianians drafted a constitution and inaugurated their government at
corydon. "the majority of the members of the convention," we are told by
a local historian, "were frontier farmers who had a general idea of what
they wanted and had sense enough to let their more erudite colleagues
put it into shape."

two years later, the pioneers of illinois, also settled upward from the
ohio, like indiana, elected their delegates to draft a constitution.
leadership in the convention, quite properly, was taken by a man born in
new york and reared in tennessee; and the constitution as finally
drafted "was in its principal provisions a copy of the then existing
constitutions of kentucky, ohio, and indiana.... many of the articles
are exact copies in wording although differently arranged and
numbered."

=louisiana, mississippi, and alabama.=--across the mississippi to the
far south, clearing and planting had gone on with much bustle and
enterprise. the cotton and sugar lands of louisiana, opened by french
and spanish settlers, were widened in every direction by planters with
their armies of slaves from the older states. new orleans, a good market
and a center of culture not despised even by the pioneer, grew apace. in
1810 the population of lower louisiana was over 75,000. the time had
come, said the leaders of the people, to fulfill the promise made to
france in the treaty of cession; namely, to grant to the inhabitants of
the territory statehood and the rights of american citizens. federalists
from new england still having a voice in congress, if somewhat weaker,
still protested in tones of horror. "i am compelled to declare it as my
deliberate opinion," pronounced josiah quincy in the house of
representatives, "that if this bill [to admit louisiana] passes, the
bonds of this union are virtually dissolved ... that as it will be the
right of all, so it will be the duty of some [states] to prepare
definitely for a separation; amicably if they can, violently if they
must.... it is a death blow to the constitution. it may afterwards
linger; but lingering, its fate will, at no very distant period, be
consummated." federalists from new york like those from new england had
their doubts about the wisdom of admitting western states; but the party
of jefferson and madison, having the necessary majority, granted the
coveted statehood to louisiana in 1812.

when, a few years later, mississippi and alabama knocked at the doors of
the union, the federalists had so little influence, on account of their
conduct during the second war with england, that spokesmen from the
southwest met a kindlier reception at washington. mississippi, in 1817,
and alabama, in 1819, took their places among the united states of
america. both of them, while granting white manhood suffrage, gave their
constitutions the tone of the old east by providing landed
qualifications for the governor and members of the legislature.

=missouri.=--far to the north in the louisiana purchase, a new
commonwealth was rising to power. it was peopled by immigrants who came
down the ohio in fleets of boats or crossed the mississippi from
kentucky and tennessee. thrifty germans from pennsylvania, hardy farmers
from virginia ready to work with their own hands, freemen seeking
freemen's homes, planters with their slaves moving on from worn-out
fields on the seaboard, came together in the widening settlements of the
missouri country. peoples from the north and south flowed together,
small farmers and big planters mingling in one community. when their
numbers had reached sixty thousand or more, they precipitated a contest
over their admission to the union, "ringing an alarm bell in the night,"
as jefferson phrased it. the favorite expedient of compromise with
slavery was brought forth in congress once more. maine consequently was
brought into the union without slavery and missouri with slavery. at the
same time there was drawn westward through the rest of the louisiana
territory a line separating servitude from slavery.


the spirit of the frontier

=land tenure and liberty.=--over an immense western area there developed
an unbroken system of freehold farms. in the gulf states and the lower
mississippi valley, it is true, the planter with his many slaves even
led in the pioneer movement; but through large sections of tennessee and
kentucky, as well as upper georgia and alabama, and all throughout the
northwest territory the small farmer reigned supreme. in this immense
dominion there sprang up a civilization without caste or class--a body
of people all having about the same amount of this world's goods and
deriving their livelihood from one source: the labor of their own hands
on the soil. the northwest territory alone almost equaled in area all
the original thirteen states combined, except georgia, and its system of
agricultural economy was unbroken by plantations and feudal estates. "in
the subdivision of the soil and the great equality of condition," as
webster said on more than one occasion, "lay the true basis, most
certainly, of popular government." there was the undoubted source of
jacksonian democracy.

[illustration: a log cabin--lincoln's birthplace]

=the characteristics of the western people.=--travelers into the
northwest during the early years of the nineteenth century were agreed
that the people of that region were almost uniformly marked by the
characteristics common to an independent yeomanry. a close observer thus
recorded his impressions: "a spirit of adventurous enterprise, a
willingness to go through any hardship to accomplish an object....
independence of thought and action. they have felt the influence of
these principles from their childhood. men who can endure anything; that
have lived almost without restraint, free as the mountain air or as the
deer and the buffalo of their forests, and who know they are americans
all.... an apparent roughness which some would deem rudeness of
manner.... where there is perfect equality in a neighborhood of people
who know little about each other's previous history or ancestry but
where each is lord of the soil he cultivates. where a log cabin is all
that the best of families can expect to have for years and of course can
possess few of the external decorations which have so much influence in
creating a diversity of rank in society. these circumstances have laid
the foundation for that equality of intercourse, simplicity of manners,
want of deference, want of reserve, great readiness to make
acquaintances, freedom of speech, indisposition to brook real or
imaginary insults which one witnesses among people of the west."

this equality, this independence, this rudeness so often described by
the traveler as marking a new country, were all accentuated by the
character of the settlers themselves. traces of the fierce, unsociable,
eagle-eyed, hard-drinking hunter remained. the settlers who followed the
hunter were, with some exceptions, soldiers of the revolutionary army,
farmers of the "middling order," and mechanics from the towns,--english,
scotch-irish, germans,--poor in possessions and thrown upon the labor of
their own hands for support. sons and daughters from well-to-do eastern
homes sometimes brought softer manners; but the equality of life and the
leveling force of labor in forest and field soon made them one in spirit
with their struggling neighbors. even the preachers and teachers, who
came when the cabins were raised in the clearings and rude churches and
schoolhouses were built, preached sermons and taught lessons that
savored of the frontier, as any one may know who reads peter
cartwright's _a muscular christian_ or eggleston's _the hoosier
schoolmaster_.


the west and the east meet

=the east alarmed.=--a people so independent as the westerners and so
attached to local self-government gave the conservative east many a rude
shock, setting gentlemen in powdered wigs and knee breeches agog with
the idea that terrible things might happen in the mississippi valley.
not without good grounds did washington fear that "a touch of a feather
would turn" the western settlers away from the seaboard to the
spaniards; and seriously did he urge the east not to neglect them, lest
they be "drawn into the arms of, or be dependent upon foreigners."
taking advantage of the restless spirit in the southwest, aaron burr,
having disgraced himself by killing alexander hamilton in a duel, laid
wild plans, if not to bring about a secession in that region, at least
to build a state of some kind out of the spanish dominions adjoining
louisiana. frightened at such enterprises and fearing the dominance of
the west, the federalists, with a few conspicuous exceptions, opposed
equality between the sections. had their narrow views prevailed, the
west, with its new democracy, would have been held in perpetual tutelage
to the seaboard or perhaps been driven into independence as the thirteen
colonies had been not long before.

=eastern friends of the west.=--fortunately for the nation, there were
many eastern leaders, particularly from the south, who understood the
west, approved its spirit, and sought to bring the two sections together
by common bonds. washington kept alive and keen the zeal for western
advancement which he acquired in his youth as a surveyor. he never grew
tired of urging upon his eastern friends the importance of the lands
beyond the mountains. he pressed upon the governor of virginia a project
for a wagon road connecting the seaboard with the ohio country and was
active in a movement to improve the navigation of the potomac. he
advocated strengthening the ties of commerce. "smooth the roads," he
said, "and make easy the way for them, and then see what an influx of
articles will be poured upon us; how amazingly our exports will be
increased by them; and how amply we shall be compensated for any trouble
and expense we may encounter to effect it." jefferson, too, was
interested in every phase of western development--the survey of lands,
the exploration of waterways, the opening of trade, and even the
discovery of the bones of prehistoric animals. robert fulton, the
inventor of the steamboat, was another man of vision who for many years
pressed upon his countrymen the necessity of uniting east and west by a
canal which would cement the union, raise the value of the public lands,
and extend the principles of confederate and republican government.

=the difficulties of early transportation.=--means of communication
played an important part in the strategy of all those who sought to
bring together the seaboard and the frontier. the produce of the
west--wheat, corn, bacon, hemp, cattle, and tobacco--was bulky and the
cost of overland transportation was prohibitive. in the eastern market,
"a cow and her calf were given for a bushel of salt, while a suit of
'store clothes' cost as much as a farm." in such circumstances, the
inhabitants of the mississippi valley were forced to ship their produce
over a long route by way of new orleans and to pay high freight rates
for everything that was brought across the mountains. scows of from five
to fifty tons were built at the towns along the rivers and piloted down
the stream to the crescent city. in a few cases small ocean-going
vessels were built to transport goods to the west indies or to the
eastern coast towns. salt, iron, guns, powder, and the absolute
essentials which the pioneers had to buy mainly in eastern markets were
carried over narrow wagon trails that were almost impassable in the
rainy season.

=the national road.=--to far-sighted men, like albert gallatin, "the
father of internal improvements," the solution of this problem was the
construction of roads and canals. early in jefferson's administration,
congress dedicated a part of the proceeds from the sale of lands to
building highways from the headwaters of the navigable waters emptying
into the atlantic to the ohio river and beyond into the northwest
territory. in 1806, after many misgivings, it authorized a great
national highway binding the east and the west. the cumberland road, as
it was called, began in northwestern maryland, wound through southern
pennsylvania, crossed the narrow neck of virginia at wheeling, and then
shot almost straight across ohio, indiana, and illinois, into missouri.
by 1817, stagecoaches were running between washington and wheeling; by
1833 contractors had carried their work to columbus, ohio, and by 1852,
to vandalia, illinois. over this ballasted road mail and passenger
coaches could go at high speed, and heavy freight wagons proceed in
safety at a steady pace.

[illustration: the cumberland road]

=canals and steamboats.=--a second epoch in the economic union of the
east and west was reached with the opening of the erie canal in 1825,
offering an all-water route from new york city to the great lakes and
the mississippi valley. pennsylvania, alarmed by the advantages
conferred on new york by this enterprise, began her system of canals and
portages from philadelphia to pittsburgh, completing the last link in
1834. in the south, the chesapeake and ohio company, chartered in 1825,
was busy with a project to connect georgetown and cumberland when
railways broke in upon the undertaking before it was half finished.
about the same time, ohio built a canal across the state, affording
water communication between lake erie and the ohio river through a rich
wheat belt. passengers could now travel by canal boat into the west with
comparative ease and comfort, if not at a rapid speed, and the bulkiest
of freight could be easily handled. moreover, the rate charged for
carrying goods was cut by the erie canal from $32 a ton per hundred
miles to $1. new orleans was destined to lose her primacy in the
mississippi valley.

the diversion of traffic to eastern markets was also stimulated by
steamboats which appeared on the ohio about 1810, three years after
fulton had made his famous trip on the hudson. it took twenty men to
sail and row a five-ton scow up the river at a speed of from ten to
twenty miles a day. in 1825, timothy flint traveled a hundred miles a
day on the new steamer _grecian_ "against the whole weight of the
mississippi current." three years later the round trip from louisville
to new orleans was cut to eight days. heavy produce that once had to
float down to new orleans could be carried upstream and sent to the east
by way of the canal systems.

thus the far country was brought near. the timid no longer hesitated at
the thought of the perilous journey. all routes were crowded with
western immigrants. the forests fell before the ax like grain before the
sickle. clearings scattered through the woods spread out into a great
mosaic of farms stretching from the southern appalachians to lake
michigan. the national census of 1830 gave 937,000 inhabitants to ohio;
343,000 to indiana; 157,000 to illinois; 687,000 to kentucky; and
681,000 to tennessee.

[illustration: distribution of population, 1830]

with the increase in population and the growth of agriculture came
political influence. people who had once petitioned congress now sent
their own representatives. men who had hitherto accepted without
protests presidents from the seaboard expressed a new spirit of dissent
in 1824 by giving only three electoral votes for john quincy adams; and
four years later they sent a son of the soil from tennessee, andrew
jackson, to take washington's chair as chief executive of the
nation--the first of a long line of presidents from the mississippi
basin.

chapter xi

jacksonian democracy


the new england federalists, at the hartford convention, prophesied that
in time the west would dominate the east. "at the adoption of the
constitution," they said, "a certain balance of power among the original
states was considered to exist, and there was at that time and yet is
among those parties a strong affinity between their great and general
interests. by the admission of these [new] states that balance has been
materially affected and unless the practice be modified must ultimately
be destroyed. the southern states will first avail themselves of their
new confederates to govern the east, and finally the western states,
multiplied in number, and augmented in population, will control the
interests of the whole." strangely enough the fulfillment of this
prophecy was being prepared even in federalist strongholds by the rise
of a new urban democracy that was to make common cause with the farmers
beyond the mountains.


the democratic movement in the east

=the aristocratic features of the old order.=--the revolutionary
fathers, in setting up their first state constitutions, although they
often spoke of government as founded on the consent of the governed, did
not think that consistency required giving the vote to all adult males.
on the contrary they looked upon property owners as the only safe
"depositary" of political power. they went back to the colonial
tradition that related taxation and representation. this, they argued,
was not only just but a safeguard against the "excesses of democracy."

in carrying their theory into execution they placed taxpaying or
property qualifications on the right to vote. broadly speaking, these
limitations fell into three classes. three states, pennsylvania (1776),
new hampshire (1784), and georgia (1798), gave the ballot to all who
paid taxes, without reference to the value of their property. three,
virginia, delaware, and rhode island, clung firmly to the ancient
principles that only freeholders could be intrusted with electoral
rights. still other states, while closely restricting the suffrage,
accepted the ownership of other things as well as land in fulfillment of
the requirements. in massachusetts, for instance, the vote was granted
to all men who held land yielding an annual income of three pounds or
possessed other property worth sixty pounds.

the electors thus enfranchised, numerous as they were, owing to the wide
distribution of land, often suffered from a very onerous disability. in
many states they were able to vote only for persons of wealth because
heavy property qualifications were imposed on public officers. in new
hampshire, the governor had to be worth five hundred pounds, one-half in
land; in massachusetts, one thousand pounds, all freehold; in maryland,
five thousand pounds, one thousand of which was freehold; in north
carolina, one thousand pounds freehold; and in south carolina, ten
thousand pounds freehold. a state senator in massachusetts had to be the
owner of a freehold worth three hundred pounds or personal property
worth six hundred pounds; in new jersey, one thousand pounds' worth of
property; in north carolina, three hundred acres of land; in south
carolina, two thousand pounds freehold. for members of the lower house
of the legislature lower qualifications were required.

in most of the states the suffrage or office holding or both were
further restricted by religious provisions. no single sect was powerful
enough to dominate after the revolution, but, for the most part,
catholics and jews were either disfranchised or excluded from office.
north carolina and georgia denied the ballot to any one who was not a
protestant. delaware withheld it from all who did not believe in the
trinity and the inspiration of the scriptures. massachusetts and
maryland limited it to christians. virginia and new york, advanced for
their day, made no discrimination in government on account of religious
opinion.

=the defense of the old order.=--it must not be supposed that property
qualifications were thoughtlessly imposed at the outset or considered of
little consequence in practice. in the beginning they were viewed as
fundamental. as towns grew in size and the number of landless citizens
increased, the restrictions were defended with even more vigor. in
massachusetts, the great webster upheld the rights of property in
government, saying: "it is entirely just that property should have its
due weight and consideration in political arrangements.... the
disastrous revolutions which the world has witnessed, those political
thunderstorms and earthquakes which have shaken the pillars of society
to their deepest foundations, have been revolutions against property."
in pennsylvania, a leader in local affairs cried out against a plan to
remove the taxpaying limitation on the suffrage: "what does the delegate
propose? to place the vicious vagrant, the wandering arabs, the tartar
hordes of our large cities on the level with the virtuous and good man?"
in virginia, jefferson himself had first believed in property
qualifications and had feared with genuine alarm the "mobs of the great
cities." it was near the end of the eighteenth century before he
accepted the idea of manhood suffrage. even then he was unable to
convince the constitution-makers of his own state. "it is not an idle
chimera of the brain," urged one of them, "that the possession of land
furnishes the strongest evidence of permanent, common interest with, and
attachment to, the community.... it is upon this foundation i wish to
place the right of suffrage. this is the best general standard which can
be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the persons to be
invested with the right of suffrage are such persons as could be,
consistently with the safety and well-being of the community, intrusted
with the exercise of that right."

=attacks on the restricted suffrage.=--the changing circumstances of
american life, however, soon challenged the rule of those with property.
prominent among the new forces were the rising mercantile and business
interests. where the freehold qualification was applied, business men
who did not own land were deprived of the vote and excluded from office.
in new york, for example, the most illiterate farmer who had one hundred
pounds' worth of land could vote for state senator and governor, while
the landless banker or merchant could not. it is not surprising,
therefore, to find business men taking the lead in breaking down
freehold limitations on the suffrage. the professional classes also were
interested in removing the barriers which excluded many of them from
public affairs. it was a schoolmaster, thomas dorr, who led the popular
uprising in rhode island which brought the exclusive rule by freeholders
to an end.

in addition to the business and professional classes, the mechanics of
the towns showed a growing hostility to a system of government that
generally barred them from voting or holding office. though not
numerous, they had early begun to exercise an influence on the course of
public affairs. they had led the riots against the stamp act, overturned
king george's statue, and "crammed stamps down the throats of
collectors." when the state constitutions were framed they took a lively
interest, particularly in new york city and philadelphia. in june, 1776,
the "mechanicks in union" in new york protested against putting the new
state constitution into effect without their approval, declaring that
the right to vote on the acceptance or rejection of a fundamental law
"is the birthright of every man to whatever state he may belong." though
their petition was rejected, their spirit remained. when, a few years
later, the federal constitution was being framed, the mechanics watched
the process with deep concern; they knew that one of its main objects
was to promote trade and commerce, affecting directly their daily bread.
during the struggle over ratification, they passed resolutions approving
its provisions and they often joined in parades organized to stir up
sentiment for the constitution, even though they could not vote for
members of the state conventions and so express their will directly.
after the organization of trade unions they collided with the courts of
law and thus became interested in the election of judges and lawmakers.

those who attacked the old system of class rule found a strong moral
support in the declaration of independence. was it not said that all men
are created equal? whoever runs may read. was it not declared that
governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed?
that doctrine was applied with effect to george iii and seemed
appropriate for use against the privileged classes of massachusetts or
virginia. "how do the principles thus proclaimed," asked the
non-freeholders of richmond, in petitioning for the ballot, "accord with
the existing regulation of the suffrage? a regulation which, instead of
the equality nature ordains, creates an odious distinction between
members of the same community ... and vests in a favored class, not in
consideration of their public services but of their private possessions,
the highest of all privileges."

=abolition of property qualifications.=--by many minor victories rather
than by any spectacular triumphs did the advocates of manhood suffrage
carry the day. slight gains were made even during the revolution or
shortly afterward. in pennsylvania, the mechanics, by taking an active
part in the contest over the constitution of 1776, were able to force
the qualification down to the payment of a small tax. vermont came into
the union in 1792 without any property restrictions. in the same year
delaware gave the vote to all men who paid taxes. maryland, reckoned one
of the most conservative of states, embarked on the experiment of
manhood suffrage in 1809; and nine years later, connecticut, equally
conservative, decided that all taxpayers were worthy of the ballot.

five states, massachusetts, new york, virginia, rhode island, and north
carolina, remained obdurate while these changes were going on around
them; finally they had to yield themselves. the last struggle in
massachusetts took place in the constitutional convention of 1820. there
webster, in the prime of his manhood, and john adams, in the closing
years of his old age, alike protested against such radical innovations
as manhood suffrage. their protests were futile. the property test was
abolished and a small tax-paying qualification was substituted. new york
surrendered the next year and, after trying some minor restrictions for
five years, went completely over to white manhood suffrage in 1826.
rhode island clung to her freehold qualification through thirty years of
agitation. then dorr's rebellion, almost culminating in bloodshed,
brought about a reform in 1843 which introduced a slight tax-paying
qualification as an alternative to the freehold. virginia and north
carolina were still unconvinced. the former refused to abandon ownership
of land as the test for political rights until 1850 and the latter until
1856. although religious discriminations and property qualifications for
office holders were sometimes retained after the establishment of
manhood suffrage, they were usually abolished along with the monopoly of
government enjoyed by property owners and taxpayers.

[illustration: thomas dorr arousing his followers]

at the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century, the white
male industrial workers and the mechanics of the northern cities, at
least, could lay aside the petition for the ballot and enjoy with the
free farmer a voice in the government of their common country.
"universal democracy," sighed carlyle, who was widely read in the united
states, "whatever we may think of it has declared itself the inevitable
fact of the days in which we live; and he who has any chance to instruct
or lead in these days must begin by admitting that ... where no
government is wanted, save that of the parish constable, as in america
with its boundless soil, every man being able to find work and
recompense for himself, democracy may subsist; not elsewhere." amid the
grave misgivings of the first generation of statesmen, america was
committed to the great adventure, in the populous towns of the east as
well as in the forests and fields of the west.


the new democracy enters the arena

the spirit of the new order soon had a pronounced effect on the
machinery of government and the practice of politics. the enfranchised
electors were not long in demanding for themselves a larger share in
administration.

=the spoils system and rotation in office.=--first of all they wanted
office for themselves, regardless of their fitness. they therefore
extended the system of rewarding party workers with government
positions--a system early established in several states, notably new
york and pennsylvania. closely connected with it was the practice of
fixing short terms for officers and making frequent changes in
personnel. "long continuance in office," explained a champion of this
idea in pennsylvania in 1837, "unfits a man for the discharge of its
duties, by rendering him arbitrary and aristocratic, and tends to beget,
first life office, and then hereditary office, which leads to the
destruction of free government." the solution offered was the historic
doctrine of "rotation in office." at the same time the principle of
popular election was extended to an increasing number of officials who
had once been appointed either by the governor or the legislature. even
geologists, veterinarians, surveyors, and other technical officers were
declared elective on the theory that their appointment "smacked of
monarchy."

=popular election of presidential electors.=--in a short time the spirit
of democracy, while playing havoc with the old order in state
government, made its way upward into the federal system. the framers of
the constitution, bewildered by many proposals and unable to agree on
any single plan, had committed the choice of presidential electors to
the discretion of the state legislatures. the legislatures, in turn,
greedy of power, early adopted the practice of choosing the electors
themselves; but they did not enjoy it long undisturbed. democracy,
thundering at their doors, demanded that they surrender the privilege to
the people. reluctantly they yielded, sometimes granting popular
election and then withdrawing it. the drift was inevitable, and the
climax came with the advent of jacksonian democracy. in 1824, vermont,
new york, delaware, south carolina, georgia, and louisiana, though some
had experimented with popular election, still left the choice of
electors with the legislature. eight years later south carolina alone
held to the old practice. popular election had become the final word.
the fanciful idea of an electoral college of "good and wise men,"
selected without passion or partisanship by state legislatures acting as
deliberative bodies, was exploded for all time; the election of the
nation's chief magistrate was committed to the tempestuous methods of
democracy.

=the nominating convention.=--as the suffrage was widened and the
popular choice of presidential electors extended, there arose a violent
protest against the methods used by the political parties in nominating
candidates. after the retirement of washington, both the republicans and
the federalists found it necessary to agree upon their favorites before
the election, and they adopted a colonial device--the pre-election
caucus. the federalist members of congress held a conference and
selected their candidate, and the republicans followed the example. in
a short time the practice of nominating by a "congressional caucus"
became a recognized institution. the election still remained with the
people; but the power of picking candidates for their approval passed
into the hands of a small body of senators and representatives.


a reaction against this was unavoidable. to friends of "the plain
people," like andrew jackson, it was intolerable, all the more so
because the caucus never favored him with the nomination. more
conservative men also found grave objections to it. they pointed out
that, whereas the constitution intended the president to be an
independent officer, he had now fallen under the control of a caucus of
congressmen. the supremacy of the legislative branch had been obtained
by an extra-legal political device. to such objections were added
practical considerations. in 1824, when personal rivalry had taken the
place of party conflicts, the congressional caucus selected as the
candidate, william h. crawford, of georgia, a man of distinction but no
great popularity, passing by such an obvious hero as general jackson.
the followers of the general were enraged and demanded nothing short of
the death of "king caucus." their clamor was effective. under their
attacks, the caucus came to an ignominious end.

in place of it there arose in 1831 a new device, the national nominating
convention, composed of delegates elected by party voters for the sole
purpose of nominating candidates. senators and representatives were
still prominent in the party councils, but they were swamped by hundreds
of delegates "fresh from the people," as jackson was wont to say. in
fact, each convention was made up mainly of office holders and office
seekers, and the new institution was soon denounced as vigorously as
king caucus had been, particularly by statesmen who failed to obtain a
nomination. still it grew in strength and by 1840 was firmly
established.

=the end of the old generation.=--in the election of 1824, the
representatives of the "aristocracy" made their last successful stand.
until then the leadership by men of "wealth and talents" had been
undisputed. there had been five presidents--washington, john adams,
jefferson, madison, and monroe--all eastern men brought up in prosperous
families with the advantages of culture which come from leisure and the
possession of life's refinements. none of them had ever been compelled
to work with his hands for a livelihood. four of them had been
slaveholders. jefferson was a philosopher, learned in natural science, a
master of foreign languages, a gentleman of dignity and grace of manner,
notwithstanding his studied simplicity. madison, it was said, was armed
"with all the culture of his century." monroe was a graduate of william
and mary, a gentleman of the old school. jefferson and his three
successors called themselves republicans and professed a genuine faith
in the people but they were not "of the people" themselves; they were
not sons of the soil or the workshop. they were all men of "the grand

old order of society" who gave finish and style even to popular
government.

monroe was the last of the presidents belonging to the heroic epoch of
the revolution. he had served in the war for independence, in the
congress under the articles of confederation, and in official capacity
after the adoption of the constitution. in short, he was of the age that
had wrought american independence and set the government afloat. with
his passing, leadership went to a new generation; but his successor,
john quincy adams, formed a bridge between the old and the new in that
he combined a high degree of culture with democratic sympathies.
washington had died in 1799, preceded but a few months by patrick henry
and followed in four years by samuel adams. hamilton had been killed in
a duel with burr in 1804. thomas jefferson and john adams were yet alive
in 1824 but they were soon to pass from the scene, reconciled at last,
full of years and honors. madison was in dignified retirement, destined
to live long enough to protest against the doctrine of nullification
proclaimed by south carolina before death carried him away at the ripe
old age of eighty-five.

=the election of john quincy adams (1824).=--the campaign of 1824 marked
the end of the "era of good feeling" inaugurated by the collapse of the
federalist party after the election of 1816. there were four leading
candidates, john quincy adams, andrew jackson, henry clay, and w.h.
crawford. the result of the election was a division of the electoral
votes into four parts and no one received a majority. under the
constitution, therefore, the selection of president passed to the house
of representatives. clay, who stood at the bottom of the poll, threw his
weight to adams and assured his triumph, much to the chagrin of
jackson's friends. they thought, with a certain justification, that
inasmuch as the hero of new orleans had received the largest electoral
vote, the house was morally bound to accept the popular judgment and
make him president. jackson shook hands cordially with adams on the day
of the inauguration, but never forgave him for being elected.

while adams called himself a republican in politics and often spoke of
"the rule of the people," he was regarded by jackson's followers as "an
aristocrat." he was not a son of the soil. neither was he acquainted at
first hand with the labor of farmers and mechanics. he had been educated
at harvard and in europe. like his illustrious father, john adams, he
was a stern and reserved man, little given to seeking popularity.
moreover, he was from the east and the frontiersmen of the west regarded
him as a man "born with a silver spoon in his mouth." jackson's
supporters especially disliked him because they thought their hero
entitled to the presidency. their anger was deepened when adams
appointed clay to the office of secretary of state; and they set up a
cry that there had been a "deal" by which clay had helped to elect adams
to get office for himself.

though adams conducted his administration with great dignity and in a
fine spirit of public service, he was unable to overcome the opposition
which he encountered on his election to office or to win popularity in
the west and south. on the contrary, by advocating government assistance
in building roads and canals and public grants in aid of education,
arts, and sciences, he ran counter to the current which had set in
against appropriations of federal funds for internal improvements. by
signing the tariff bill of 1828, soon known as the "tariff of
abominations," he made new enemies without adding to his friends in new
york, pennsylvania, and ohio where he sorely needed them. handicapped by
the false charge that he had been a party to a "corrupt bargain" with
clay to secure his first election; attacked for his advocacy of a high
protective tariff; charged with favoring an "aristocracy of
office-holders" in washington on account of his refusal to discharge
government clerks by the wholesale, adams was retired from the white
house after he had served four years.

=the triumph of jackson in 1828.=--probably no candidate for the
presidency ever had such passionate popular support as andrew jackson
had in 1828. he was truly a man of the people. born of poor parents in
the upland region of south carolina, schooled in poverty and adversity,
without the advantages of education or the refinements of cultivated
leisure, he seemed the embodiment of the spirit of the new american
democracy. early in his youth he had gone into the frontier of tennessee
where he soon won a name as a fearless and intrepid indian fighter. on
the march and in camp, he endeared himself to his men by sharing their
hardships, sleeping on the ground with them, and eating parched corn
when nothing better could be found for the privates. from local
prominence he sprang into national fame by his exploit at the battle of
new orleans. his reputation as a military hero was enhanced by the
feeling that he had been a martyr to political treachery in 1824. the
farmers of the west and south claimed him as their own. the mechanics of
the eastern cities, newly enfranchised, also looked upon him as their
friend. though his views on the tariff, internal improvements, and other
issues before the country were either vague or unknown, he was readily
elected president.

the returns of the electoral vote in 1828 revealed the sources of
jackson's power. in new england, he received but one ballot, from
maine; he had a majority of the electors in new york and all of them in
pennsylvania; and he carried every state south of maryland and beyond
the appalachians. adams did not get a single electoral vote in the south
and west. the prophecy of the hartford convention had been fulfilled.

when jackson took the oath of office on march 4, 1829, the government of
the united states entered into a new era. until this time the
inauguration of a president--even that of jefferson, the apostle of
simplicity--had brought no rude shock to the course of affairs at the
capital. hitherto the installation of a president meant that an
old-fashioned gentleman, accompanied by a few servants, had driven to
the white house in his own coach, taken the oath with quiet dignity,
appointed a few new men to the higher posts, continued in office the
long list of regular civil employees, and begun his administration with
respectable decorum. jackson changed all this. when he was inaugurated,
men and women journeyed hundreds of miles to witness the ceremony. great
throngs pressed into the white house, "upset the bowls of punch, broke
the glasses, and stood with their muddy boots on the satin-covered
chairs to see the people's president." if jefferson's inauguration was,
as he called it, the "great revolution," jackson's inauguration was a
cataclysm.


the new democracy at washington

=the spoils system.=--the staid and respectable society of washington
was disturbed by this influx of farmers and frontiersmen. to speak of
politics became "bad form" among fashionable women. the clerks and
civil servants of the government who had enjoyed long and secure tenure
of office became alarmed at the clamor of new men for their positions.
doubtless the major portion of them had opposed the election of jackson
and looked with feelings akin to contempt upon him and his followers.
with a hunter's instinct, jackson scented his prey. determined to have
none but his friends in office, he made a clean sweep, expelling old
employees to make room for men "fresh from the people." this was a new
custom. other presidents had discharged a few officers for engaging in
opposition politics. they had been careful in making appointments not to
choose inveterate enemies; but they discharged relatively few men on
account of their political views and partisan activities.

by wholesale removals and the frank selection of officers on party
grounds--a practice already well intrenched in new york--jackson
established the "spoils system" at washington. the famous slogan, "to
the victor belong the spoils of victory," became the avowed principle of
the national government. statesmen like calhoun denounced it; poets like
james russell lowell ridiculed it; faithful servants of the government
suffered under it; but it held undisturbed sway for half a century
thereafter, each succeeding generation outdoing, if possible, its
predecessor in the use of public office for political purposes. if any
one remarked that training and experience were necessary qualifications
for important public positions, he met jackson's own profession of
faith: "the duties of any public office are so simple or admit of being
made so simple that any man can in a short time become master of them."

=the tariff and nullification.=--jackson had not been installed in power
very long before he was compelled to choose between states' rights and
nationalism. the immediate occasion of the trouble was the tariff--a
matter on which jackson did not have any very decided views. his mind
did not run naturally to abstruse economic questions; and owing to the
divided opinion of the country it was "good politics" to be vague and
ambiguous in the controversy. especially was this true, because the
tariff issue was threatening to split the country into parties again.

_the development of the policy of "protection."_--the war of 1812 and
the commercial policies of england which followed it had accentuated the
need for american economic independence. during that conflict, the
united states, cut off from english manufactures as during the
revolution, built up home industries to meet the unusual call for iron,
steel, cloth, and other military and naval supplies as well as the
demands from ordinary markets. iron foundries and textile mills sprang
up as in the night; hundreds of business men invested fortunes in
industrial enterprises so essential to the military needs of the
government; and the people at large fell into the habit of buying
american-made goods again. as the london _times_ tersely observed of the
americans, "their first war with england made them independent; their
second war made them formidable."

in recognition of this state of affairs, the tariff of 1816 was
designed: _first_, to prevent england from ruining these "infant
industries" by dumping the accumulated stores of years suddenly upon
american markets; and, _secondly_, to enlarge in the manufacturing
centers the demand for american agricultural produce. it accomplished
the purposes of its framers. it kept in operation the mills and furnaces
so recently built. it multiplied the number of industrial workers and
enhanced the demand for the produce of the soil. it brought about
another very important result. it turned the capital and enterprise of
new england from shipping to manufacturing, and converted her statesmen,
once friends of low tariffs, into ardent advocates of protection.

in the early years of the nineteenth century, the yankees had bent their
energies toward building and operating ships to carry produce from
america to europe and manufactures from europe to america. for this
reason, they had opposed the tariff of 1816 calculated to increase
domestic production and cut down the carrying trade. defeated in their
efforts, they accepted the inevitable and turned to manufacturing. soon
they were powerful friends of protection for american enterprise. as the
money invested and the labor employed in the favored industries
increased, the demand for continued and heavier protection grew apace.
even the farmers who furnished raw materials, like wool, flax, and hemp,
began to see eye to eye with the manufacturers. so the textile interests
of new england, the iron masters of connecticut, new jersey, and
pennsylvania, the wool, hemp, and flax growers of ohio, kentucky, and
tennessee, and the sugar planters of louisiana developed into a
formidable combination in support of a high protective tariff.

_the planting states oppose the tariff._--in the meantime, the cotton
states on the seaboard had forgotten about the havoc wrought during the
napoleonic wars when their produce rotted because there were no ships to
carry it to europe. the seas were now open. the area devoted to cotton
had swiftly expanded as alabama, mississippi, and louisiana were opened
up. cotton had in fact become "king" and the planters depended for their
prosperity, as they thought, upon the sale of their staple to english
manufacturers whose spinning and weaving mills were the wonder of the
world. manufacturing nothing and having to buy nearly everything except
farm produce and even much of that for slaves, the planters naturally
wanted to purchase manufactures in the cheapest market, england, where
they sold most of their cotton. the tariff, they contended, raised the
price of the goods they had to buy and was thus in fact a tribute laid
on them for the benefit of the northern mill owners.

_the tariff of abominations._--they were overborne, however, in 1824 and
again in 1828 when northern manufacturers and western farmers forced
congress to make an upward revision of the tariff. the act of 1828 known
as "the tariff of abominations," though slightly modified in 1832, was
"the straw which broke the camel's back." southern leaders turned in
rage against the whole system. the legislatures of virginia, north
carolina, south carolina, georgia, and alabama denounced it; a general
convention of delegates held at augusta issued a protest of defiance
against it; and south carolina, weary of verbal battles, decided to
prevent its enforcement.

_south carolina nullifies the tariff._--the legislature of that state,
on october 26, 1832, passed a bill calling for a state convention which
duly assembled in the following month. in no mood for compromise, it
adopted the famous ordinance of nullification after a few days' debate.
every line of this document was clear and firm. the tariff, it opened,
gives "bounties to classes and individuals ... at the expense and to the
injury and oppression of other classes and individuals"; it is a
violation of the constitution of the united states and therefore null
and void; its enforcement in south carolina is unlawful; if the federal
government attempts to coerce the state into obeying the law, "the
people of this state will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all
further obligations to maintain or preserve their political connection
with the people of the other states and will forthwith proceed to
organize a separate government and do all other acts and things which
sovereign and independent states may of right do."

_southern states condemn nullification._--the answer of the country to
this note of defiance, couched in the language used in the kentucky
resolutions and by the new england federalists during the war of 1812,
was quick and positive. the legislatures of the southern states, while
condemning the tariff, repudiated the step which south carolina had
taken. georgia responded: "we abhor the doctrine of nullification as
neither a peaceful nor a constitutional remedy." alabama found it
"unsound in theory and dangerous in practice." north carolina replied
that it was "revolutionary in character, subversive of the constitution
of the united states." mississippi answered: "it is disunion by
force--it is civil war." virginia spoke more softly, condemning the
tariff and sustaining the principle of the virginia resolutions but
denying that south carolina could find in them any sanction for her
proceedings.

_jackson firmly upholds the union._--the eyes of the country were turned
upon andrew jackson. it was known that he looked with no friendly
feelings upon nullification, for, at a jefferson dinner in the spring of
1830 while the subject was in the air, he had with laconic firmness
announced a toast: "our federal union; it must be preserved." when two
years later the open challenge came from south carolina, he replied that
he would enforce the law, saying with his frontier directness: "if a
single drop of blood shall be shed there in opposition to the laws of
the united states, i will hang the first man i can lay my hands on
engaged in such conduct upon the first tree that i can reach." he made
ready to keep his word by preparing for the use of military and naval
forces in sustaining the authority of the federal government. then in a
long and impassioned proclamation to the people of south carolina he
pointed out the national character of the union, and announced his
solemn resolve to preserve it by all constitutional means. nullification
he branded as "incompatible with the existence of the union,
contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution, unauthorized
by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was
founded, and destructive of the great objects for which it was formed."

_a compromise._--in his messages to congress, however, jackson spoke the
language of conciliation. a few days before issuing his proclamation he
suggested that protection should be limited to the articles of domestic
manufacture indispensable to safety in war time, and shortly afterward
he asked for new legislation to aid him in enforcing the laws. with two
propositions before it, one to remove the chief grounds for south
carolina's resistance and the other to apply force if it was continued,
congress bent its efforts to avoid a crisis. on february 12, 1833,
henry clay laid before the senate a compromise tariff bill providing for
the gradual reduction of the duties until by 1842 they would reach the
level of the law which calhoun had supported in 1816. about the same
time the "force bill," designed to give the president ample authority in
executing the law in south carolina, was taken up. after a short but
acrimonious debate, both measures were passed and signed by president
jackson on the same day, march 2. looking upon the reduction of the
tariff as a complete vindication of her policy and an undoubted victory,
south carolina rescinded her ordinance and enacted another nullifying
the force bill.

daniel webster]

_the webster-hayne debate._--where the actual victory lay in this
quarrel, long the subject of high dispute, need not concern us to-day.
perhaps the chief result of the whole affair was a clarification of the
issue between the north and the south--a definite statement of the
principles for which men on both sides were years afterward to lay down
their lives. on behalf of nationalism and a perpetual union, the stanch
old democrat from tennessee had, in his proclamation on nullification,
spoken a language that admitted of only one meaning. on behalf of
nullification, senator hayne, of south carolina, a skilled lawyer and
courtly orator, had in a great speech delivered in the senate in
january, 1830, set forth clearly and cogently the doctrine that the
union is a compact among sovereign states from which the parties may
lawfully withdraw. it was this address that called into the arena
daniel webster, senator from massachusetts, who, spreading the mantle
of oblivion over the hartford convention, delivered a reply to hayne
that has been reckoned among the powerful orations of all time--a plea
for the supremacy of the constitution and the national character of the
union.

=the war on the united states bank.=--if events forced the issue of
nationalism and nullification upon jackson, the same could not be said
of his attack on the bank. that institution, once denounced by every
true jeffersonian, had been reestablished in 1816 under the
administration of jefferson's disciple, james madison. it had not been
in operation very long, however, before it aroused bitter opposition,
especially in the south and the west. its notes drove out of circulation
the paper currency of unsound banks chartered by the states, to the
great anger of local financiers. it was accused of favoritism in making
loans, of conferring special privileges upon politicians in return for
their support at washington. to all jackson's followers it was "an
insidious money power." one of them openly denounced it as an
institution designed "to strengthen the arm of wealth and counterpoise
the influence of extended suffrage in the disposition of public
affairs."

this sentiment president jackson fully shared. in his first message to
congress he assailed the bank in vigorous language. he declared that its
constitutionality was in doubt and alleged that it had failed to
establish a sound and uniform currency. if such an institution was
necessary, he continued, it should be a public bank, owned and managed
by the government, not a private concern endowed with special privileges
by it. in his second and third messages, jackson came back to the
subject, leaving the decision, however, to "an enlightened people and
their representatives."

moved by this frank hostility and anxious for the future, the bank
applied to congress for a renewal of its charter in 1832, four years
before the expiration of its life. clay, with his eye upon the
presidency and an issue for the campaign, warmly supported the
application. congress, deeply impressed by his leadership, passed the
bill granting the new charter, and sent the open defiance to jackson.
his response was an instant veto. the battle was on and it raged with
fury until the close of his second administration, ending in the
destruction of the bank, a disordered currency, and a national panic.

in his veto message, jackson attacked the bank as unconstitutional and
even hinted at corruption. he refused to assent to the proposition that
the supreme court had settled the question of constitutionality by the
decision in the mcculloch case. "each public officer," he argued, "who
takes an oath to support the constitution, swears that he will support
it as he understands it, not as it is understood by others."

not satisfied with his veto and his declaration against the bank,
jackson ordered the secretary of the treasury to withdraw the government
deposits which formed a large part of the institution's funds. this
action he followed up by an open charge that the bank had used money
shamefully to secure the return of its supporters to congress. the
senate, stung by this charge, solemnly resolved that jackson had
"assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the
constitution and laws, but in derogation of both."

the effects of the destruction of the bank were widespread. when its
charter expired in 1836, banking was once more committed to the control
of the states. the state legislatures, under a decision rendered by the
supreme court after the death of marshall, began to charter banks under
state ownership and control, with full power to issue paper money--this
in spite of the provision in the constitution that states shall not
issue bills of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin legal
tender in the payment of debts. once more the country was flooded by
paper currency of uncertain value. to make matters worse, jackson
adopted the practice of depositing huge amounts of government funds in
these banks, not forgetting to render favors to those institutions which
supported him in politics--"pet banks," as they were styled at the
time. in 1837, partially, though by no means entirely, as a result of
the abolition of the bank, the country was plunged into one of the most
disastrous panics which it ever experienced.

=internal improvements checked.=--the bank had presented to jackson a
very clear problem--one of destruction. other questions were not so
simple, particularly the subject of federal appropriations in aid of
roads and other internal improvements. jefferson had strongly favored
government assistance in such matters, but his administration was
followed by a reaction. both madison and monroe vetoed acts of congress
appropriating public funds for public roads, advancing as their reason
the argument that the constitution authorized no such laws. jackson,
puzzled by the clamor on both sides, followed their example without
making the constitutional bar absolute. congress, he thought, might
lawfully build highways of a national and military value, but he
strongly deprecated attacks by local interests on the federal treasury.

=the triumph of the executive branch.=--jackson's reelection in 1832
served to confirm his opinion that he was the chosen leader of the
people, freed and instructed to ride rough shod over congress and even
the courts. no president before or since ever entertained in times of
peace such lofty notions of executive prerogative. the entire body of
federal employees he transformed into obedient servants of his wishes, a
sign or a nod from him making and undoing the fortunes of the humble and
the mighty. his lawful cabinet of advisers, filling all of the high
posts in the government, he treated with scant courtesy, preferring
rather to secure his counsel and advice from an unofficial body of
friends and dependents who, owing to their secret methods and back
stairs arrangements, became known as "the kitchen cabinet." under the
leadership of a silent, astute, and resourceful politician, amos
kendall, this informal gathering of the faithful both gave and carried
out decrees and orders, communicating the president's lightest wish or
strictest command to the uttermost part of the country. resolutely and
in the face of bitter opposition jackson had removed the deposits from
the united states bank. when the senate protested against this arbitrary
conduct, he did not rest until it was forced to expunge the resolution
of condemnation; in time one of his lieutenants with his own hands was
able to tear the censure from the records. when chief justice marshall
issued a decree against georgia which did not suit him, jackson,
according to tradition, blurted out that marshall could go ahead and
enforce his own orders. to the end he pursued his willful way, finally
even choosing his own successor.


the rise of the whigs

=jackson's measures arouse opposition.=--measures so decided, policies
so radical, and conduct so high-handed could not fail to arouse against
jackson a deep and exasperated opposition. the truth is the conduct of
his entire administration profoundly disturbed the business and finances
of the country. it was accompanied by conditions similar to those which
existed under the articles of confederation. a paper currency, almost as
unstable and irritating as the worthless notes of revolutionary days,
flooded the country, hindering the easy transaction of business. the use
of federal funds for internal improvements, so vital to the exchange of
commodities which is the very life of industry, was blocked by executive
vetoes. the supreme court, which, under marshall, had held refractory
states to their obligations under the constitution, was flouted; states'
rights judges, deliberately selected by jackson for the bench, began to
sap and undermine the rulings of marshall. the protective tariff, under
which the textile industry of new england, the iron mills of
pennsylvania, and the wool, flax, and hemp farms of the west had
flourished, had received a severe blow in the compromise of 1833 which
promised a steady reduction of duties. to cap the climax, jackson's
party, casting aside the old and reputable name of republican, boldly
chose for its title the term "democrat," throwing down the gauntlet to
every conservative who doubted the omniscience of the people. all these
things worked together to evoke an opposition that was sharp and
determined.

[illustration: an old cartoon ridiculing clay's tariff and internal
improvement program]

=clay and the national republicans.=--in this opposition movement,
leadership fell to henry clay, a son of kentucky, rather than to daniel
webster of massachusetts. like jackson, clay was born in a home haunted
by poverty. left fatherless early and thrown upon his own resources, he
went from virginia into kentucky where by sheer force of intellect he
rose to eminence in the profession of law. without the martial gifts or
the martial spirit of jackson, he slipped more easily into the social
habits of the east at the same time that he retained his hold on the
affections of the boisterous west. farmers of ohio, indiana, and
kentucky loved him; financiers of new york and philadelphia trusted him.
he was thus a leader well fitted to gather the forces of opposition
into union against jackson.

around clay's standard assembled a motley collection, representing every
species of political opinion, united by one tie only--hatred for "old
hickory." nullifiers and less strenuous advocates of states' rights were
yoked with nationalists of webster's school; ardent protectionists were
bound together with equally ardent free traders, all fraternizing in one
grand confusion of ideas under the title of "national republicans." thus
the ancient and honorable term selected by jefferson and his party, now
abandoned by jacksonian democracy, was adroitly adopted to cover the
supporters of clay. the platform of the party, however, embraced all the
old federalist principles: protection for american industry; internal
improvements; respect for the supreme court; resistance to executive
tyranny; and denunciation of the spoils system. though jackson was
easily victorious in 1832, the popular vote cast for clay should have
given him some doubts about the faith of "the whole people" in the
wisdom of his "reign."

=van buren and the panic of 1837.=--nothing could shake the general's
superb confidence. at the end of his second term he insisted on
selecting his own successor; at a national convention, chosen by party
voters, but packed with his office holders and friends, he nominated
martin van buren of new york. once more he proved his strength by
carrying the country for the democrats. with a fine flourish, he
attended the inauguration of van buren and then retired, amid the
applause and tears of his devotees, to the hermitage, his home in
tennessee.

fortunately for him, jackson escaped the odium of a disastrous panic
which struck the country with terrible force in the following summer.
among the contributory causes of this crisis, no doubt, were the
destruction of the bank and the issuance of the "specie circular" of

1836 which required the purchasers of public lands to pay for them in
coin, instead of the paper notes of state banks. whatever the dominating
cause, the ruin was widespread. bank after bank went under; boom towns
in the west collapsed; eastern mills shut down; and working people in
the industrial centers, starving from unemployment, begged for relief.
van buren braved the storm, offering no measure of reform or assistance
to the distracted people. he did seek security for government funds by
suggesting the removal of deposits from private banks and the
establishment of an independent treasury system, with government
depositaries for public funds, in several leading cities. this plan was
finally accepted by congress in 1840.

had van buren been a captivating figure he might have lived down the
discredit of the panic unjustly laid at his door; but he was far from
being a favorite with the populace. though a man of many talents, he
owed his position to the quiet and adept management of jackson rather
than to his own personal qualities. the men of the frontier did not care
for him. they suspected that he ate from "gold plate" and they could not
forgive him for being an astute politician from new york. still the
democratic party, remembering jackson's wishes, renominated him
unanimously in 1840 and saw him go down to utter defeat.

=the whigs and general harrison.=--by this time, the national
republicans, now known as whigs--a title taken from the party of
opposition to the crown in england, had learned many lessons. taking a
leaf out of the democratic book, they nominated, not clay of kentucky,
well known for his views on the bank, the tariff, and internal
improvements, but a military hero, general william henry harrison, a man
of uncertain political opinions. harrison, a son of a virginia signer of
the declaration of independence, sprang into public view by winning a
battle more famous than important, "tippecanoe"--a brush with the
indians in indiana. he added to his laurels by rendering praiseworthy
services during the war of 1812. when days of peace returned he was
rewarded by a grateful people with a seat in congress. then he retired
to quiet life in a little village near cincinnati. like jackson he was
held to be a son of the south and the west. like jackson he was a
military hero, a lesser light, but still a light. like old hickory he
rode into office on a tide of popular feeling against an eastern man
accused of being something of an aristocrat. his personal popularity was
sufficient. the whigs who nominated him shrewdly refused to adopt a
platform or declare their belief in anything. when some democrat
asserted that harrison was a backwoodsman whose sole wants were a jug of
hard cider and a log cabin, the whigs treated the remark not as an
insult but as proof positive that harrison deserved the votes of jackson
men. the jug and the cabin they proudly transformed into symbols of the
campaign, and won for their chieftain 234 electoral votes, while van
buren got only sixty.

=harrison and tyler.=--the hero of tippecanoe was not long to enjoy the
fruits of his victory. the hungry horde of whig office seekers descended
upon him like wolves upon the fold. if he went out they waylaid him; if
he stayed indoors, he was besieged; not even his bed chamber was spared.
he was none too strong at best and he took a deep cold on the day of his
inauguration. between driving out democrats and appeasing whigs, he fell
mortally ill. before the end of a month he lay dead at the capitol.

harrison's successor, john tyler, the vice president, whom the whigs had
nominated to catch votes in virginia, was more of a democrat than
anything else, though he was not partisan enough to please anybody. the
whigs railed at him because he would not approve the founding of another
united states bank. the democrats stormed at him for refusing, until
near the end of his term, to sanction the annexation of texas, which had
declared its independence of mexico in 1836. his entire administration,
marked by unseemly wrangling, produced only two measures of importance.
the whigs, flushed by victory, with the aid of a few protectionist
democrats, enacted, in 1842, a new tariff law destroying the compromise
which had brought about the truce between the north and the south, in
the days of nullification. the distinguished leader of the whigs, daniel
webster, as secretary of state, in negotiation with lord ashburton
representing great britain, settled the long-standing dispute between
the two countries over the maine boundary. a year after closing this
chapter in american diplomacy, webster withdrew to private life, leaving
the president to endure alone the buffets of political fortune.

to the end, the whigs regarded tyler as a traitor to their cause; but
the judgment of history is that it was a case of the biter bitten. they
had nominated him for the vice presidency as a man of views acceptable
to southern democrats in order to catch their votes, little reckoning
with the chances of his becoming president. tyler had not deceived them
and, thoroughly soured, he left the white house in 1845 not to appear in
public life again until the days of secession, when he espoused the
southern confederacy. jacksonian democracy, with new leadership, serving
a new cause--slavery--was returned to power under james k. polk, a
friend of the general from tennessee. a few grains of sand were to run
through the hour glass before the whig party was to be broken and
scattered as the federalists had been more than a generation before.


the interaction of american and european opinion

=democracy in england and france.=--during the period of jacksonian
democracy, as in all epochs of ferment, there was a close relation
between the thought of the new world and the old. in england, the
successes of the american experiment were used as arguments in favor of
overthrowing the aristocracy which george iii had manipulated with such
effect against america half a century before. in the united states, on
the other hand, conservatives like chancellor kent, the stout opponent
of manhood suffrage in new york, cited the riots of the british working
classes as a warning against admitting the same classes to a share in
the government of the united states. along with the agitation of opinion
went epoch-making events. in 1832, the year of jackson's second
triumph, the british parliament passed its first reform bill, which
conferred the ballot--not on workingmen as yet--but on mill owners and
shopkeepers whom the landlords regarded with genuine horror. the initial
step was thus taken in breaking down the privileges of the landed
aristocracy and the rich merchants of england.

about the same time a popular revolution occurred in france. the bourbon
family, restored to the throne of france by the allied powers after
their victory over napoleon in 1815, had embarked upon a policy of
arbitrary government. to use the familiar phrase, they had learned
nothing and forgotten nothing. charles x, who came to the throne in
1824, set to work with zeal to undo the results of the french
revolution, to stifle the press, restrict the suffrage, and restore the
clergy and the nobility to their ancient rights. his policy encountered
equally zealous opposition and in 1830 he was overthrown. the popular
party, under the leadership of lafayette, established, not a republic as
some of the radicals had hoped, but a "liberal" middle-class monarchy
under louis philippe. this second french revolution made a profound
impression on americans, convincing them that the whole world was moving
toward democracy. the mayor, aldermen, and citizens of new york city
joined in a great parade to celebrate the fall of the bourbons. mingled
with cheers for the new order in france were hurrahs for "the people's
own, andrew jackson, the hero of new orleans and president of the united
states!"

=european interest in america.=--to the older and more settled
europeans, the democratic experiment in america was either a menace or
an inspiration. conservatives viewed it with anxiety; liberals with
optimism. far-sighted leaders could see that the tide of democracy was
rising all over the world and could not be stayed. naturally the country
that had advanced furthest along the new course was the place in which
to find arguments for and against proposals that europe should make
experiments of the same character.

=de tocqueville's _democracy in america_.=--in addition to the casual
traveler there began to visit the united states the thoughtful observer
bent on finding out what manner of nation this was springing up in the
wilderness. those who looked with sympathy upon the growing popular
forces of england and france found in the united states, in spite of
many blemishes and defects, a guarantee for the future of the people's
rule in the old world. one of these, alexis de tocqueville, a french
liberal of mildly democratic sympathies, made a journey to this country
in 1831; he described in a very remarkable volume, _democracy in
america_, the grand experiment as he saw it. on the whole he was
convinced. after examining with a critical eye the life and labor of the
american people, as well as the constitutions of the states and the
nation, he came to the conclusion that democracy with all its faults was
both inevitable and successful. slavery he thought was a painful
contrast to the other features of american life, and he foresaw what
proved to be the irrepressible conflict over it. he believed that
through blundering the people were destined to learn the highest of all
arts, self-government on a grand scale. the absence of a leisure class,
devoted to no calling or profession, merely enjoying the refinements of
life and adding to its graces--the flaw in american culture that gave
deep distress to many a european leader--de tocqueville thought a
necessary virtue in the republic. "amongst a democratic people where
there is no hereditary wealth, every man works to earn a living, or has
worked, or is born of parents who have worked. a notion of labor is
therefore presented to the mind on every side as the necessary, natural,
and honest condition of human existence." it was this notion of a
government in the hands of people who labored that struck the french
publicist as the most significant fact in the modern world.

=harriet martineau's visit to america.=--this phase of american life
also profoundly impressed the brilliant english writer, harriet
martineau. she saw all parts of the country, the homes of the rich and
the log cabins of the frontier; she traveled in stagecoaches, canal
boats, and on horseback; and visited sessions of congress and auctions
at slave markets. she tried to view the country impartially and the
thing that left the deepest mark on her mind was the solidarity of the
people in one great political body. "however various may be the tribes
of inhabitants in those states, whatever part of the world may have been
their birthplace, or that of their fathers, however broken may be their
language, however servile or noble their employments, however exalted or
despised their state, all are declared to be bound together by equal
political obligations.... in that self-governing country all are held to
have an equal interest in the principles of its institutions and to be
bound in equal duty to watch their workings." miss martineau was also
impressed with the passion of americans for land ownership and
contrasted the united states favorably with england where the tillers of
the soil were either tenants or laborers for wages.

=adverse criticism.=--by no means all observers and writers were
convinced that america was a success. the fastidious traveler, mrs.
trollope, who thought the english system of church and state was ideal,
saw in the united states only roughness and ignorance. she lamented the
"total and universal want of manners both in males and females," adding
that while "they appear to have clear heads and active intellects,"
there was "no charm, no grace in their conversation." she found
everywhere a lack of reverence for kings, learning, and rank. other
critics were even more savage. the editor of the _foreign quarterly_
petulantly exclaimed that the united states was "a brigand
confederation." charles dickens declared the country to be "so maimed
and lame, so full of sores and ulcers that her best friends turn from
the loathsome creature in disgust." sydney smith, editor of the
_edinburgh review_, was never tired of trying his caustic wit at the
expense of america. "their franklins and washingtons and all the other
sages and heroes of their revolution were born and bred subjects of the
king of england," he observed in 1820. "during the thirty or forty
years of their independence they have done absolutely nothing for the
sciences, for the arts, for literature, or even for the statesmanlike
studies of politics or political economy.... in the four quarters of the
globe who reads an american book? or goes to an american play? or looks
at an american picture or statue?" to put a sharp sting into his taunt
he added, forgetting by whose authority slavery was introduced and
fostered: "under which of the old tyrannical governments of europe is
every sixth man a slave whom his fellow creatures may buy and sell?"

some americans, while resenting the hasty and often superficial
judgments of european writers, winced under their satire and took
thought about certain particulars in the indictments brought against
them. the mass of the people, however, bent on the great experiment,
gave little heed to carping critics who saw the flaws and not the
achievements of our country--critics who were in fact less interested in
america than in preventing the rise and growth of democracy in europe.

chapter xii

the middle border and the great west


"we shall not send an emigrant beyond the mississippi in a hundred
years," exclaimed livingston, the principal author of the louisiana
purchase. when he made this astounding declaration, he doubtless had
before his mind's eye the great stretches of unoccupied lands between
the appalachians and the mississippi. he also had before him the history
of the english colonies, which told him of the two centuries required to
settle the seaboard region. to practical men, his prophecy did not seem
far wrong; but before the lapse of half that time there appeared beyond
the mississippi a tier of new states, reaching from the gulf of mexico
to the southern boundary of minnesota, and a new commonwealth on the
pacific ocean where american emigrants had raised the bear flag of
california.


the advance of the middle border

=missouri.=--when the middle of the nineteenth century had been reached,
the mississippi river, which daniel boone, the intrepid hunter, had
crossed during washington's administration "to escape from civilization"
in kentucky, had become the waterway for a vast empire. the center of
population of the united states had passed to the ohio valley. missouri,
with its wide reaches of rich lands, low-lying, level, and fertile, well
adapted to hemp raising, had drawn to its borders thousands of planters
from the old southern states--from virginia and the carolinas as well as
from kentucky and tennessee. when the great compromise of 1820-21
admitted her to the union, wearing "every jewel of sovereignty," as a
florid orator announced, migratory slave owners were assured that their
property would be safe in missouri. along the western shore of the
mississippi and on both banks of the missouri to the uttermost limits of
the state, plantations tilled by bondmen spread out in broad expanses.
in the neighborhood of jefferson city the slaves numbered more than a
fourth of the population.

into this stream of migration from the planting south flowed another
current of land-tilling farmers; some from kentucky, tennessee, and
mississippi, driven out by the onrush of the planters buying and
consolidating small farms into vast estates; and still more from the
east and the old world. to the northwest over against iowa and to the
southwest against arkansas, these yeomen laid out farms to be tilled by
their own labor. in those regions the number of slaves seldom rose above
five or six per cent of the population. the old french post, st. louis,
enriched by the fur trade of the far west and the steamboat traffic of
the river, grew into a thriving commercial city, including among its
seventy-five thousand inhabitants in 1850 nearly forty thousand
foreigners, german immigrants from pennsylvania and europe being the
largest single element.

=arkansas.=--below missouri lay the territory of arkansas, which had
long been the paradise of the swarthy hunter and the restless
frontiersman fleeing from the advancing borders of farm and town. in
search of the life, wild and free, where the rifle supplied the game and
a few acres of ground the corn and potatoes, they had filtered into the
territory in an unending drift, "squatting" on the land. without so much
as asking the leave of any government, territorial or national, they
claimed as their own the soil on which they first planted their feet.
like the cherokee indians, whom they had as neighbors, whose very
customs and dress they sometimes adopted, the squatters spent their days
in the midst of rough plenty, beset by chills, fevers, and the ills of
the flesh, but for many years unvexed by political troubles or the
restrictions of civilized life.

unfortunately for them, however, the fertile valleys of the mississippi
and arkansas were well adapted to the cultivation of cotton and tobacco
and their sylvan peace was soon broken by an invasion of planters. the
newcomers, with their servile workers, spread upward in the valley
toward missouri and along the southern border westward to the red river.
in time the slaves in the tier of counties against louisiana ranged from
thirty to seventy per cent of the population. this marked the doom of
the small farmer, swept arkansas into the main current of planting
politics, and led to a powerful lobby at washington in favor of
admission to the union, a boon granted in 1836.

=michigan.=--in accordance with a well-established custom, a free state
was admitted to the union to balance a slave state. in 1833, the people
of michigan, a territory ten times the size of connecticut, announced
that the time had come for them to enjoy the privileges of a
commonwealth. all along the southern border the land had been occupied
largely by pioneers from new england, who built prim farmhouses and
adopted the town-meeting plan of self-government after the fashion of
the old home. the famous post of detroit was growing into a flourishing
city as the boats plying on the great lakes carried travelers, settlers,
and freight through the narrows. in all, according to the census, there
were more than ninety thousand inhabitants in the territory; so it was
not without warrant that they clamored for statehood. congress, busy as
ever with politics, delayed; and the inhabitants of michigan, unable to
restrain their impatience, called a convention, drew up a constitution,
and started a lively quarrel with ohio over the southern boundary. the
hand of congress was now forced. objections were made to the new
constitution on the ground that it gave the ballot to all free white
males, including aliens not yet naturalized; but the protests were
overborne in a long debate. the boundary was fixed, and michigan, though
shorn of some of the land she claimed, came into the union in 1837.

=wisconsin.=--across lake michigan to the west lay the territory of
wisconsin, which shared with michigan the interesting history of the
northwest, running back into the heroic days when french hunters and
missionaries were planning a french empire for the great monarch, louis
xiv. it will not be forgotten that the french rangers of the woods, the
black-robed priests, prepared for sacrifice, even to death, the trappers
of the french agencies, and the french explorers--marquette, joliet, and
menard--were the first white men to paddle their frail barks through the
northern waters. they first blazed their trails into the black forests
and left traces of their work in the names of portages and little
villages. it was from these forests that red men in full war paint
journeyed far to fight under the _fleur-de-lis_ of france when the
soldiers of king louis made their last stand at quebec and montreal
against the imperial arms of britain. it was here that the british flag
was planted in 1761 and that the great pontiac conspiracy was formed two
years later to overthrow british dominion.

when, a generation afterward, the stars and stripes supplanted the union
jack, the french were still almost the only white men in the region.
they were soon joined by hustling yankee fur traders who did battle
royal against british interlopers. the traders cut their way through
forest trails and laid out the routes through lake and stream and over
portages for the settlers and their families from the states "back
east." it was the forest ranger who discovered the water power later
used to turn the busy mills grinding the grain from the spreading farm
lands. in the wake of the fur hunters, forest men, and farmers came
miners from kentucky, tennessee, and missouri crowding in to exploit the
lead ores of the northwest, some of them bringing slaves to work their
claims. had it not been for the gold fever of 1849 that drew the
wielders of pick and shovel to the far west, wisconsin would early have
taken high rank among the mining regions of the country.

from a favorable point of vantage on lake michigan, the village of
milwaukee, a center for lumber and grain transport and a place of entry
for eastern goods, grew into a thriving city. it claimed twenty thousand
inhabitants, when in 1848 congress admitted wisconsin to the union.
already the germans, irish, and scandinavians had found their way into
the territory. they joined americans from the older states in clearing
forests, building roads, transforming trails into highways, erecting
mills, and connecting streams with canals to make a network of routes
for the traffic that poured to and from the great lakes.

=iowa and minnesota.=--to the southwest of wisconsin beyond the
mississippi, where the tall grass of the prairies waved like the sea,
farmers from new england, new york, and ohio had prepared iowa for
statehood. a tide of immigration that might have flowed into missouri
went northward; for freemen, unaccustomed to slavery and slave markets,
preferred the open country above the compromise line. with incredible
swiftness, they spread farms westward from the mississippi. with yankee
ingenuity they turned to trading on the river, building before 1836
three prosperous centers of traffic: dubuque, davenport, and burlington.
true to their old traditions, they founded colleges and academies that
religion and learning might be cherished on the frontier as in the
states from which they came. prepared for self-government, the iowans
laid siege to the door of congress and were admitted to the union in
1846.

above iowa, on the mississippi, lay the territory of minnesota--the home
of the dakotas, the ojibways, and the sioux. like michigan and
wisconsin, it had been explored early by the french scouts, and the
first white settlement was the little french village of mendota. to the
people of the united states, the resources of the country were first
revealed by the historic journey of zebulon pike in 1805 and by american
fur traders who were quick to take advantage of the opportunity to ply
their arts of hunting and bartering in fresh fields. in 1839 an
american settlement was planted at marina on the st. croix, the outpost
of advancing civilization. within twenty years, the territory, boasting
a population of 150,000, asked for admission to the union. in 1858 the
plea was granted and minnesota showed her gratitude three years later by
being first among the states to offer troops to lincoln in the hour of
peril.


on to the pacific--texas and the mexican war

=the uniformity of the middle west.=--there was a certain monotony about
pioneering in the northwest and on the middle border. as the long
stretches of land were cleared or prepared for the plow, they were laid
out like checkerboards into squares of forty, eighty, one hundred sixty,
or more acres, each the seat of a homestead. there was a striking
uniformity also about the endless succession of fertile fields spreading
far and wide under the hot summer sun. no majestic mountains relieved
the sweep of the prairie. few monuments of other races and antiquity
were there to awaken curiosity about the region. no sonorous bells in
old missions rang out the time of day. the chaffering red man bartering
blankets and furs for powder and whisky had passed farther on. the
population was made up of plain farmers and their families engaged in
severe and unbroken labor, chopping down trees, draining fever-breeding
swamps, breaking new ground, and planting from year to year the same
rotation of crops. nearly all the settlers were of native american stock
into whose frugal and industrious lives the later irish and german
immigrants fitted, on the whole, with little friction. even the dutch
oven fell before the cast-iron cooking stove. happiness and sorrow,
despair and hope were there, but all encompassed by the heavy tedium of
prosaic sameness.

[illustration: santa barbara mission]

=a contrast in the far west and southwest.=--as george rogers clark and
daniel boone had stirred the snug americans of the seaboard to seek
their fortunes beyond the appalachians, so now kit carson, james bowie,
sam houston, davy crockett, and john c. fremont were to lead the way
into a new land, only a part of which was under the american flag. the
setting for this new scene in the westward movement was thrown out in a
wide sweep from the headwaters of the mississippi to the banks of the
rio grande; from the valleys of the sabine and red rivers to montana and
the pacific slope. in comparison with the middle border, this region
presented such startling diversities that only the eye of faith could
foresee the unifying power of nationalism binding its communities with
the older sections of the country. what contrasts indeed! the blue grass
region of kentucky or the rich, black soil of illinois--the painted
desert, the home of the sage brush and the coyote! the level prairies of
iowa--the mighty rockies shouldering themselves high against the
horizon! the long bleak winters of wisconsin--california of endless
summer! the log churches of indiana or illinois--the quaint missions of
san antonio, tucson, and santa barbara! the little state of
delaware--the empire of texas, one hundred and twenty times its area!
and scattered about through the southwest were signs of an ancient
civilization--fragments of four-and five-story dwellings, ruined dams,
aqueducts, and broken canals, which told of once prosperous peoples
who, by art and science, had conquered the aridity of the desert and
lifted themselves in the scale of culture above the savages of the
plain.

the settlers of this vast empire were to be as diverse in their origins
and habits as those of the colonies on the coast had been. americans of
english, irish, and scotch-irish descent came as usual from the eastern
states. to them were added the migratory germans as well. now for the
first time came throngs of scandinavians. some were to make their homes
on quiet farms as the border advanced against the setting sun. others
were to be indian scouts, trappers, fur hunters, miners, cowboys, texas
planters, keepers of lonely posts on the plain and the desert, stage
drivers, pilots of wagon trains, pony riders, fruit growers, "lumber
jacks," and smelter workers. one common bond united them--a passion for
the self-government accorded to states. as soon as a few thousand
settlers came together in a single territory, there arose a mighty shout
for a position beside the staid commonwealths of the east and the south.
statehood meant to the pioneers self-government, dignity, and the right
to dispose of land, minerals, and timber in their own way. in the quest
for this local autonomy there arose many a wordy contest in congress,
each of the political parties lending a helping hand in the admission of
a state when it gave promise of adding new congressmen of the "right
political persuasion," to use the current phrase.

=southern planters and texas.=--while the farmers of the north found the
broad acres of the western prairies stretching on before them apparently
in endless expanse, it was far different with the southern planters.
ever active in their search for new fields as they exhausted the virgin
soil of the older states, the restless subjects of king cotton quickly
reached the frontier of louisiana. there they paused; but only for a
moment. the fertile land of texas just across the boundary lured them on
and the mexican republic to which it belonged extended to them a more
than generous welcome. little realizing the perils lurking in a
"peaceful penetration," the authorities at mexico city opened wide the
doors and made large grants of land to american contractors, who agreed
to bring a number of families into texas. the omnipresent yankee, in the
person of moses austin of connecticut, hearing of this good news in the
southwest, obtained a grant in 1820 to settle three hundred americans
near bexar--a commission finally carried out to the letter by his son
and celebrated in the name given to the present capital of the state of
texas. within a decade some twenty thousand americans had crossed the
border.

=mexico closes the door.=--the government of mexico, unaccustomed to
such enterprise and thoroughly frightened by its extent, drew back in
dismay. its fears were increased as quarrels broke out between the
americans and the natives in texas. fear grew into consternation when
efforts were made by president jackson to buy the territory for the
united states. mexico then sought to close the flood gates. it stopped
all american colonization schemes, canceled many of the land grants, put
a tariff on farming implements, and abolished slavery. these barriers
were raised too late. a call for help ran through the western border of
the united states. the sentinels of the frontier answered. davy
crockett, the noted frontiersman, bear hunter, and backwoods politician;
james bowie, the dexterous wielder of the knife that to this day bears
his name; and sam houston, warrior and pioneer, rushed to the aid of
their countrymen in texas. unacquainted with the niceties of diplomacy,
impatient at the formalities of international law, they soon made it
known that in spite of mexican sovereignty they would be their own
masters.

=the independence of texas declared.=--numbering only about one-fourth
of the population in texas, they raised the standard of revolt in 1836
and summoned a convention. following in the footsteps of their
ancestors, they issued a declaration of independence signed mainly by
americans from the slave states. anticipating that the government of
mexico would not quietly accept their word of defiance as final, they
dispatched a force to repel "the invading army," as general houston
called the troops advancing under the command of santa ana, the mexican
president. a portion of the texan soldiers took their stand in the
alamo, an old spanish mission in the cottonwood trees in the town of san
antonio. instead of obeying the order to blow up the mission and retire,
they held their ground until they were completely surrounded and cut off
from all help. refusing to surrender, they fought to the bitter end, the
last man falling a victim to the sword. vengeance was swift. within
three months general houston overwhelmed santa ana at the san jacinto,
taking him prisoner of war and putting an end to all hopes for the
restoration of mexican sovereignty over texas.

the lone star republic, with houston at the head, then sought admission
to the united states. this seemed at first an easy matter. all that was
required to bring it about appeared to be a treaty annexing texas to the
union. moreover, president jackson, at the height of his popularity, had
a warm regard for general houston and, with his usual sympathy for rough
and ready ways of doing things, approved the transaction. through an
american representative in mexico, jackson had long and anxiously
labored, by means none too nice, to wring from the mexican republic the
cession of the coveted territory. when the texans took matters into
their own hands, he was more than pleased; but he could not marshal the
approval of two-thirds of the senators required for a treaty of
annexation. cautious as well as impetuous, jackson did not press the
issue; he went out of office in 1837 with texas uncertain as to her
future.

=northern opposition to annexation.=--all through the north the
opposition to annexation was clear and strong. anti-slavery agitators
could hardly find words savage enough to express their feelings.
"texas," exclaimed channing in a letter to clay, "is but the first step
of aggression. i trust indeed that providence will beat back and humble
our cupidity and ambition. i now ask whether as a people we are
prepared to seize on a neighboring territory for the end of extending
slavery? i ask whether as a people we can stand forth in the sight of
god, in the sight of nations, and adopt this atrocious policy? sooner
perish! sooner be our name blotted out from the record of nations!"
william lloyd garrison called for the secession of the northern states
if texas was brought into the union with slavery. john quincy adams
warned his countrymen that they were treading in the path of the
imperialism that had brought the nations of antiquity to judgment and
destruction. henry clay, the whig candidate for president, taking into
account changing public sentiment, blew hot and cold, losing the state
of new york and the election of 1844 by giving a qualified approval of
annexation. in the same campaign, the democrats boldly demanded the
"reannexation of texas," based on claims which the united states once
had to spanish territory beyond the sabine river.

=annexation.=--the politicians were disposed to walk very warily. van
buren, at heart opposed to slavery extension, refused to press the issue
of annexation. tyler, a pro-slavery democrat from virginia, by a strange
fling of fortune carried into office as a nominal whig, kept his mind
firmly fixed on the idea of reelection and let the troublesome matter
rest until the end of his administration was in sight. he then listened
with favor to the voice of the south. calhoun stated what seemed to be a
convincing argument: all good americans have their hearts set on the
constitution; the admission of texas is absolutely essential to the
preservation of the union; it will give a balance of power to the south
as against the north growing with incredible swiftness in wealth and
population. tyler, impressed by the plea, appointed calhoun to the
office of secretary of state in 1844, authorizing him to negotiate the
treaty of annexation--a commission at once executed. this scheme was
blocked in the senate where the necessary two-thirds vote could not be
secured. balked but not defeated, the advocates of annexation drew up a
joint resolution which required only a majority vote in both houses,
and in february of the next year, just before tyler gave way to polk,
they pushed it through congress. so texas, amid the groans of boston and
the hurrahs of charleston, folded up her flag and came into the union.

[illustration: texas and the territory in dispute]

=the mexican war.=--the inevitable war with mexico, foretold by the
abolitionists and feared by henry clay, ensued, the ostensible cause
being a dispute over the boundaries of the new state. the texans claimed
all the lands down to the rio grande. the mexicans placed the border of
texas at the nueces river and a line drawn thence in a northerly
direction. president polk, accepting the texan view of the controversy,
ordered general zachary taylor to move beyond the nueces in defense of
american sovereignty. this act of power, deemed by the mexicans an
invasion of their territory, was followed by an attack on our troops.

president polk, not displeased with the turn of events, announced that
american blood had been "spilled on american soil" and that war existed
"by the act of mexico." congress, in a burst of patriotic fervor,
brushed aside the protests of those who deplored the conduct of the
government as wanton aggression on a weaker nation and granted money and
supplies to prosecute the war. the few whigs in the house of
representatives, who refused to vote in favor of taking up arms,
accepted the inevitable with such good grace as they could command. all
through the south and the west the war was popular. new england
grumbled, but gave loyal, if not enthusiastic, support to a conflict
precipitated by policies not of its own choosing. only a handful of firm
objectors held out. james russell lowell, in his _biglow papers_, flung
scorn and sarcasm to the bitter end.

=the outcome of the war.=--the foregone conclusion was soon reached.
general taylor might have delivered the fatal thrust from northern
mexico if politics had not intervened. polk, anxious to avoid raising up
another military hero for the whigs to nominate for president, decided
to divide the honors by sending general scott to strike a blow at the
capital, mexico city. the deed was done with speed and pomp and two
heroes were lifted into presidential possibilities. in the far west a
third candidate was made, john c. fremont, who, in cooperation with
commodores sloat and stockton and general kearney, planted the stars and
stripes on the pacific slope.

in february, 1848, the mexicans came to terms, ceding to the victor
california, arizona, new mexico, and more--a domain greater in extent
than the combined areas of france and germany. as a salve to the wound,
the vanquished received fifteen million dollars in cash and the
cancellation of many claims held by american citizens. five years later,
through the negotiations of james gadsden, a further cession of lands
along the southern border of arizona and new mexico was secured on
payment of ten million dollars.

=general taylor elected president.=--the ink was hardly dry upon the
treaty that closed the war before "rough and ready" general taylor, a
slave owner from louisiana, "a whig," as he said, "but not an ultra
whig," was put forward as the whig candidate for president. he himself
had not voted for years and he was fairly innocent in matters political.
the tariff, the currency, and internal improvements, with a magnificent
gesture he referred to the people's representatives in congress,
offering to enforce the laws as made, if elected. clay's followers
mourned. polk stormed but could not win even a renomination at the hands
of the democrats. so it came about that the hero of buena vista,
celebrated for his laconic order, "give 'em a little more grape, captain
bragg," became president of the united states.


the pacific coast and utah

=oregon.=--closely associated in the popular mind with the contest about
the affairs of texas was a dispute with great britain over the
possession of territory in oregon. in their presidential campaign of
1844, the democrats had coupled with the slogan, "the reannexation of
texas," two other cries, "the reoccupation of oregon," and "fifty-four
forty or fight." the last two slogans were founded on american
discoveries and explorations in the far northwest. their appearance in
politics showed that the distant oregon country, larger in area than new
england, new york, and pennsylvania combined, was at last receiving from
the nation the attention which its importance warranted.

_joint occupation and settlement._--both england and the united states
had long laid claim to oregon and in 1818 they had agreed to occupy the
territory jointly--a contract which was renewed ten years later for an
indefinite period. under this plan, citizens of both countries were free
to hunt and settle anywhere in the region. the vanguard of british fur
traders and canadian priests was enlarged by many new recruits, with
americans not far behind them. john jacob astor, the resourceful new
york merchant, sent out trappers and hunters who established a trading
post at astoria in 1811. some twenty years later, american
missionaries--among them two very remarkable men, jason lee and marcus
whitman--were preaching the gospel to the indians.

through news from the fur traders and missionaries, eastern farmers
heard of the fertile lands awaiting their plows on the pacific slope;
those with the pioneering spirit made ready to take possession of the
new country. in 1839 a band went around by cape horn. four years later a
great expedition went overland. the way once broken, others followed
rapidly. as soon as a few settlements were well established, the
pioneers held a mass meeting and agreed upon a plan of government. "we,
the people of oregon territory," runs the preamble to their compact,
"for the purposes of mutual protection and to secure peace and
prosperity among ourselves, agree to adopt the following laws and
regulations until such time as the united states of america extend their
jurisdiction over us." thus self-government made its way across the
rocky mountains.

[illustration: the oregon country and the disputed boundary]

_the boundary dispute with england adjusted._--by this time it was
evident that the boundaries of oregon must be fixed. having made the
question an issue in his campaign, polk, after his election in 1844,
pressed it upon the attention of the country. in his inaugural address
and his first message to congress he reiterated the claim of the
democratic platform that "our title to the whole territory of oregon is
clear and unquestionable." this pretension great britain firmly
rejected, leaving the president a choice between war and compromise.

polk, already having the contest with mexico on his hands, sought and
obtained a compromise. the british government, moved by a hint from the
american minister, offered a settlement which would fix the boundary at
the forty-ninth parallel instead of "fifty-four forty," and give it
vancouver island. polk speedily chose this way out of the dilemma.
instead of making the decision himself, however, and drawing up a
treaty, he turned to the senate for "counsel." as prearranged with party
leaders, the advice was favorable to the plan. the treaty, duly drawn in
1846, was ratified by the senate after an acrimonious debate. "oh!
mountain that was delivered of a mouse," exclaimed senator benton, "thy
name shall be fifty-four forty!" thirteen years later, the southern part
of the territory was admitted to the union as the state of oregon,
leaving the northern and eastern sections in the status of a territory.

=california.=--with the growth of the northwestern empire, dedicated by
nature to freedom, the planting interests might have been content, had
fortune not wrested from them the fair country of california. upon this
huge territory they had set their hearts. the mild climate and fertile
soil seemed well suited to slavery and the planters expected to extend
their sway to the entire domain. california was a state of more than
155,000 square miles--about seventy times the size of the state of
delaware. it could readily be divided into five or six large states, if
that became necessary to preserve the southern balance of power.

_early american relations with california._--time and tide, it seems,
were not on the side of the planters. already americans of a far
different type were invading the pacific slope. long before polk ever
dreamed of california, the yankee with his cargo of notions had been
around the horn. daring skippers had sailed out of new england harbors
with a variety of goods, bent their course around south america to
california, on to china and around the world, trading as they went and
leaving pots, pans, woolen cloth, guns, boots, shoes, salt fish, naval
stores, and rum in their wake. "home from californy!" rang the cry in
many a new england port as a good captain let go his anchor on his
return from the long trading voyage in the pacific.

[illustration: the overland trails]

_the overland trails._--not to be outdone by the mariners of the deep,
western scouts searched for overland routes to the pacific. zebulon
pike, explorer and pathfinder, by his expedition into the southwest
during jefferson's administration, had discovered the resources of new
spain and had shown his countrymen how easy it was to reach santa fe
from the upper waters of the arkansas river. not long afterward, traders
laid open the route, making franklin, missouri, and later fort
leavenworth the starting point. along the trail, once surveyed, poured
caravans heavily guarded by armed men against marauding indians. sand
storms often wiped out all signs of the route; hunger and thirst did
many a band of wagoners to death; but the lure of the game and the
profits at the end kept the business thriving. huge stocks of cottons,
glass, hardware, and ammunition were drawn almost across the continent
to be exchanged at santa fe for furs, indian blankets, silver, and
mules; and many a fortune was made out of the traffic.

_americans in california._--why stop at santa fe? the question did not
long remain unanswered. in 1829, ewing young broke the path to los
angeles. thirteen years later fremont made the first of his celebrated
expeditions across plain, desert, and mountain, arousing the interest of
the entire country in the far west. in the wake of the pathfinders went
adventurers, settlers, and artisans. by 1847, more than one-fifth of the
inhabitants in the little post of two thousand on san francisco bay were
from the united states. the mexican war, therefore, was not the
beginning but the end of the american conquest of california--a conquest
initiated by americans who went to till the soil, to trade, or to follow
some mechanical pursuit.

_the discovery of gold._--as if to clinch the hold on california already
secured by the friends of free soil, there came in 1848 the sudden
discovery of gold at sutter's mill in the sacramento valley. when this
exciting news reached the east, a mighty rush began to california, over
the trails, across the isthmus of panama, and around cape horn. before
two years had passed, it is estimated that a hundred thousand people, in
search of fortunes, had arrived in california--mechanics, teachers,
doctors, lawyers, farmers, miners, and laborers from the four corners of
the earth.

[illustration: _from an old print_

san francisco in 1849]

_california a free state._--with this increase in population there
naturally resulted the usual demand for admission to the union. instead
of waiting for authority from washington, the californians held a
convention in 1849 and framed their constitution. with impatience, the
delegates brushed aside the plea that "the balance of power between the
north and south" required the admission of their state as a slave
commonwealth. without a dissenting voice, they voted in favor of freedom
and boldly made their request for inclusion among the united states.
president taylor, though a southern man, advised congress to admit the
applicant. robert toombs of georgia vowed to god that he preferred
secession. henry clay, the great compromiser, came to the rescue and in
1850 california was admitted as a free state.

=utah.=--on the long road to california, in the midst of forbidding and
barren wastes, a religious sect, the mormons, had planted a colony
destined to a stormy career. founded in 1830 under the leadership of
joseph smith of new york, the sect had suffered from many cruel buffets
of fortune. from ohio they had migrated into missouri where they were
set upon and beaten. some of them were murdered by indignant neighbors.
harried out of missouri, they went into illinois only to see their
director and prophet, smith, first imprisoned by the authorities and
then shot by a mob. having raised up a cloud of enemies on account of
both their religious faith and their practice of allowing a man to have
more than one wife, they fell in heartily with the suggestion of a new
leader, brigham young, that they go into the far west beyond the plains
of kansas--into the forlorn desert where the wicked would cease from
troubling and the weary could be at rest, as they read in the bible. in
1847, young, with a company of picked men, searched far and wide until
he found a suitable spot overlooking the salt lake valley. returning to
illinois, he gathered up his followers, now numbering several thousand,
and in one mighty wagon caravan they all went to their distant haven.

_brigham young and his economic system._--in brigham young the mormons
had a leader of remarkable power who gave direction to the redemption of
the arid soil, the management of property, and the upbuilding of
industry. he promised them to make the desert blossom as the rose, and
verily he did it. he firmly shaped the enterprise of the colony along
co-operative lines, holding down the speculator and profiteer with one
hand and giving encouragement to the industrious poor with the other.
with the shrewdness befitting a good business man, he knew how to draw
the line between public and private interest. land was given outright to
each family, but great care was exercised in the distribution so that
none should have great advantage over another. the purchase of supplies
and the sale of produce were carried on through a cooperative store, the
profits of which went to the common good. encountering for the first
time in the history of the anglo-saxon race the problem of aridity, the
mormons surmounted the most perplexing obstacles with astounding skill.
they built irrigation works by cooperative labor and granted water
rights to all families on equitable terms.

_the growth of industries._--though farming long remained the major
interest of the colony, the mormons, eager to be self-supporting in
every possible way, bent their efforts also to manufacturing and later
to mining. their missionaries, who hunted in the highways and byways of
europe for converts, never failed to stress the economic advantages of
the sect. "we want," proclaimed president young to all the earth, "a
company of woolen manufacturers to come with machinery and take the wool
from the sheep and convert it into the best clothes. we want a company
of potters; we need them; the clay is ready and the dishes wanted.... we
want some men to start a furnace forthwith; the iron, coal, and molders
are waiting.... we have a printing press and any one who can take good
printing and writing paper to the valley will be a blessing to
themselves and the church." roads and bridges were built; millions were
spent in experiments in agriculture and manufacturing; missionaries at a
huge cost were maintained in the east and in europe; an army was kept
for defense against the indians; and colonies were planted in the
outlying regions. a historian of deseret, as the colony was called by
the mormons, estimated in 1895 that by the labor of their hands the
people had produced nearly half a billion dollars in wealth since the
coming of the vanguard.

_polygamy forbidden._--the hope of the mormons that they might forever
remain undisturbed by outsiders was soon dashed to earth, for hundreds
of farmers and artisans belonging to other religious sects came to
settle among them. in 1850 the colony was so populous and prosperous
that it was organized into a territory of the united states and brought
under the supervision of the federal government. protests against
polygamy were raised in the colony and at the seat of authority three
thousand miles away at washington. the new republican party in 1856
proclaimed it "the right and duty of congress to prohibit in the
territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery." in
due time the mormons had to give up their marriage practices which were
condemned by the common opinion of all western civilization; but they
kept their religious faith. monuments to their early enterprise are seen
in the temple and the tabernacle, the irrigation works, and the great
wealth of the church.


summary of western development and national politics

while the statesmen of the old generation were solving the problems of
their age, hunters, pioneers, and home seekers were preparing new
problems beyond the alleghanies. the west was rising in population and
wealth. between 1783 and 1829, eleven states were added to the original
thirteen. all but two were in the west. two of them were in the
louisiana territory beyond the mississippi. here the process of
colonization was repeated. hardy frontier people cut down the forests,
built log cabins, laid out farms, and cut roads through the wilderness.
they began a new civilization just as the immigrants to virginia or
massachusetts had done two centuries earlier.

like the seaboard colonists before them, they too cherished the spirit
of independence and power. they had not gone far upon their course
before they resented the monopoly of the presidency by the east. in 1829
they actually sent one of their own cherished leaders, andrew jackson,
to the white house. again in 1840, in 1844, in 1848, and in 1860, the
mississippi valley could boast that one of its sons had been chosen for
the seat of power at washington. its democratic temper evoked a cordial
response in the towns of the east where the old aristocracy had been put
aside and artisans had been given the ballot.

for three decades the west occupied the interest of the nation. under
jackson's leadership, it destroyed the second united states bank. when
he smote nullification in south carolina, it gave him cordial support.
it approved his policy of parceling out government offices among party
workers--"the spoils system" in all its fullness. on only one point did
it really dissent. the west heartily favored internal improvements, the
appropriation of federal funds for highways, canals, and railways.
jackson had misgivings on this question and awakened sharp criticism by
vetoing a road improvement bill.

from their point of vantage on the frontier, the pioneers pressed on
westward. they pushed into texas, created a state, declared their
independence, demanded a place in the union, and precipitated a war with
mexico. they crossed the trackless plain and desert, laying out trails
to santa fe, to oregon, and to california. they were upon the scene when
the mexican war brought california under the stars and stripes. they had
laid out their farms in the willamette valley when the slogan
"fifty-four forty or fight" forced a settlement of the oregon boundary.
california and oregon were already in the union when there arose the
great civil war testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated could long endure.

part v. sectional conflict and reconstruction




chapter xiii

the rise of the industrial system


if jefferson could have lived to see the stars and stripes planted on
the pacific coast, the broad empire of texas added to the planting
states, and the valley of the willamette waving with wheat sown by
farmers from new england, he would have been more than fortified in his
faith that the future of america lay in agriculture. even a stanch old
federalist like gouverneur morris or josiah quincy would have mournfully
conceded both the prophecy and the claim. manifest destiny never seemed
more clearly written in the stars.

as the farmers from the northwest and planters from the southwest poured
in upon the floor of congress, the party of jefferson, christened anew
by jackson, grew stronger year by year. opponents there were, no doubt,
disgruntled critics and whigs by conviction; but in 1852 franklin
pierce, the democratic candidate for president, carried every state in
the union except massachusetts, vermont, kentucky, and tennessee. this
victory, a triumph under ordinary circumstances, was all the more
significant in that pierce was pitted against a hero of the mexican war,
general scott, whom the whigs, hoping to win by rousing the martial
ardor of the voters, had nominated. on looking at the election returns,
the new president calmly assured the planters that "the general
principle of reduction of duties with a view to revenue may now be
regarded as the settled policy of the country." with equal confidence,
he waved aside those agitators who devoted themselves "to the supposed
interests of the relatively few africans in the united states." like a
watchman in the night he called to the country: "all's well."

the party of hamilton and clay lay in the dust.


the industrial revolution

as pride often goeth before a fall, so sanguine expectation is sometimes
the symbol of defeat. jackson destroyed the bank. polk signed the tariff
bill of 1846 striking an effective blow at the principle of protection
for manufactures. pierce promised to silence the abolitionists. his
successor was to approve a drastic step in the direction of free trade.
nevertheless all these things left untouched the springs of power that
were in due time to make america the greatest industrial nation on the
earth; namely, vast national resources, business enterprise, inventive
genius, and the free labor supply of europe. unseen by the thoughtless,
unrecorded in the diaries of wiseacres, rarely mentioned in the speeches
of statesmen, there was swiftly rising such a tide in the affairs of
america as jefferson and hamilton never dreamed of in their little
philosophies.

=the inventors.=--watt and boulton experimenting with steam in england,
whitney combining wood and steel into a cotton gin, fulton and fitch
applying the steam engine to navigation, stevens and peter cooper trying
out the "iron horse" on "iron highways," slater building spinning mills
in pawtucket, howe attaching the needle to the flying wheel, morse
spanning a continent with the telegraph, cyrus field linking the markets
of the new world with the old along the bed of the atlantic, mccormick
breaking the sickle under the reaper--these men and a thousand more were
destroying in a mighty revolution of industry the world of the
stagecoach and the tallow candle which washington and franklin had
inherited little changed from the age of caesar. whitney was to make
cotton king. watt and fulton were to make steel and steam masters of the
world. agriculture was to fall behind in the race for supremacy.

=industry outstrips planting.=--the story of invention, that tribute to
the triumph of mind over matter, fascinating as a romance, need not be
treated in detail here. the effects of invention on social and political
life, multitudinous and never-ending, form the very warp and woof of
american progress from the days of andrew jackson to the latest hour.
neither the great civil conflict--the clash of two systems--nor the
problems of the modern age can be approached without an understanding of
the striking phases of industrialism.

[illustration: a new england mill built in 1793]

first and foremost among them was the uprush of mills managed by
captains of industry and manned by labor drawn from farms, cities, and
foreign lands. for every planter who cleared a domain in the southwest
and gathered his army of bondmen about him, there rose in the north a
magician of steam and steel who collected under his roof an army of free
workers.

in seven league boots this new giant strode ahead of the southern giant.
between 1850 and 1859, to use dollars and cents as the measure of
progress, the value of domestic manufactures including mines and
fisheries rose from $1,019,106,616 to $1,900,000,000, an increase of
eighty-six per cent in ten years. in this same period the total
production of naval stores, rice, sugar, tobacco, and cotton, the
staples of the south, went only from $165,000,000, in round figures, to
$204,000,000. at the halfway point of the century, the capital invested
in industry, commerce, and cities far exceeded the value of all the farm
land between the atlantic and the pacific; thus the course of economy
had been reversed in fifty years. tested by figures of production, king
cotton had shriveled by 1860 to a petty prince in comparison, for each
year the captains of industry turned out goods worth nearly twenty times
all the bales of cotton picked on southern plantations. iron, boots and
shoes, and leather goods pouring from northern mills surpassed in value
the entire cotton output.

=the agrarian west turns to industry.=--nor was this vast enterprise
confined to the old northeast where, as madison had sagely remarked,
commerce was early dominant. "cincinnati," runs an official report in
1854, "appears to be a great central depot for ready-made clothing and
its manufacture for the western markets may be said to be one of the
great trades of that city." there, wrote another traveler, "i heard the
crack of the cattle driver's whip and the hum of the factory: the west
and the east meeting." louisville and st. louis were already famous for
their clothing trades and the manufacture of cotton bagging. five
hundred of the two thousand woolen mills in the country in 1860 were in
the western states. of the output of flour and grist mills, which almost
reached in value the cotton crop of 1850, the ohio valley furnished a
rapidly growing share. the old home of jacksonian democracy, where
federalists had been almost as scarce as monarchists, turned slowly
backward, as the needle to the pole, toward the principle of protection
for domestic industry, espoused by hamilton and defended by clay.

=the extension of canals and railways.=--as necessary to mechanical
industry as steel and steam power was the great market, spread over a
wide and diversified area and knit together by efficient means of
transportation. this service was supplied to industry by the steamship,
which began its career on the hudson in 1807; by the canals, of which
the erie opened in 1825 was the most noteworthy; and by the railways,
which came into practical operation about 1830.

[illustration: _from an old print_

an early railway]

with sure instinct the eastern manufacturer reached out for the markets
of the northwest territory where free farmers were producing annually
staggering crops of corn, wheat, bacon, and wool. the two great canal
systems--the erie connecting new york city with the waterways of the
great lakes and the pennsylvania chain linking philadelphia with the
headwaters of the ohio--gradually turned the tide of trade from new
orleans to the eastern seaboard. the railways followed the same paths.
by 1860, new york had rail connections with chicago and st. louis, one
of the routes running through the hudson and mohawk valleys and along
the great lakes, the other through philadelphia and pennsylvania and
across the rich wheat fields of ohio, indiana, and illinois. baltimore,
not to be outdone by her two rivals, reached out over the mountains for
the western trade and in 1857 had trains running into st. louis.

in railway enterprise the south took more interest than in canals, and
the friends of that section came to its aid. to offset the magnet
drawing trade away from the mississippi valley, lines were built from
the gulf to chicago, the illinois central part of the project being a
monument to the zeal and industry of a democrat, better known in
politics than in business, stephen a. douglas. the swift movement of
cotton and tobacco to the north or to seaports was of common concern to
planters and manufacturers. accordingly lines were flung down along the
southern coast, linking richmond, charleston, and savannah with the
northern markets. other lines struck inland from the coast, giving a
rail outlet to the sea for raleigh, columbia, atlanta, chattanooga,
nashville, and montgomery. nevertheless, in spite of this enterprise,
the mileage of all the southern states in 1860 did not equal that of
ohio, indiana, and illinois combined.

=banking and finance.=--out of commerce and manufactures and the
construction and operation of railways came such an accumulation of
capital in the northern states as merchants of old never imagined. the
banks of the four industrial states of massachusetts, connecticut, new
york, and pennsylvania in 1860 had funds greater than the banks in all
the other states combined. new york city had become the money market of
america, the center to which industrial companies, railway promoters,
farmers, and planters turned for capital to initiate and carry on their
operations. the banks of louisiana, south carolina, georgia, and
virginia, it is true, had capital far in excess of the banks of the
northwest; but still they were relatively small compared with the
financial institutions of the east.

=the growth of the industrial population.=--a revolution of such
magnitude in industry, transport, and finance, overturning as it did the
agrarian civilization of the old northwest and reaching out to the very
borders of the country, could not fail to bring in its train
consequences of a striking character. some were immediate and obvious.
others require a fullness of time not yet reached to reveal their
complete significance. outstanding among them was the growth of an
industrial population, detached from the land, concentrated in cities,
and, to use jefferson's phrase, dependent upon "the caprices and
casualties of trade" for a livelihood. this was a result, as the great
virginian had foreseen, which flowed inevitably from public and private
efforts to stimulate industry as against agriculture.

[illustration: lowell, massachusetts, in 1838, an early industrial
town]

it was estimated in 1860, on the basis of the census figures, that
mechanical production gave employment to 1,100,000 men and 285,000
women, making, if the average number of dependents upon them be
reckoned, nearly six million people or about one-sixth of the population
of the country sustained from manufactures. "this," runs the official
record, "was exclusive of the number engaged in the production of many
of the raw materials and of the food for manufacturers; in the
distribution of their products, such as merchants, clerks, draymen,
mariners, the employees of railroads, expresses, and steamboats; of
capitalists, various artistic and professional classes, as well as
carpenters, bricklayers, painters, and the members of other mechanical
trades not classed as manufactures. it is safe to assume, then, that
one-third of the whole population is supported, directly, or indirectly,
by manufacturing industry." taking, however, the number of persons
directly supported by manufactures, namely about six millions, reveals
the astounding fact that the white laboring population, divorced from
the soil, already exceeded the number of slaves on southern farms and
plantations.

_immigration._--the more carefully the rapid growth of the industrial
population is examined, the more surprising is the fact that such an
immense body of free laborers could be found, particularly when it is
recalled to what desperate straits the colonial leaders were put in
securing immigrants,--slavery, indentured servitude, and kidnapping
being the fruits of their necessities. the answer to the enigma is to be
found partly in european conditions and partly in the cheapness of
transportation after the opening of the era of steam navigation. shrewd
observers of the course of events had long foreseen that a flood of
cheap labor was bound to come when the way was made easy. some, among
them chief justice ellsworth, went so far as to prophesy that white
labor would in time be so abundant that slavery would disappear as the
more costly of the two labor systems. the processes of nature were aided
by the policies of government in england and germany.

_the coming of the irish._--the opposition of the irish people to the
english government, ever furious and irrepressible, was increased in the
mid forties by an almost total failure of the potato crop, the main
support of the peasants. catholic in religion, they had been compelled
to support a protestant church. tillers of the soil by necessity, they
were forced to pay enormous tributes to absentee landlords in england
whose claim to their estates rested upon the title of conquest and
confiscation. intensely loyal to their race, the irish were subjected in
all things to the parliament at london, in which their small minority of
representatives had little influence save in holding a balance of power
between the two contending english parties. to the constant political
irritation, the potato famine added physical distress beyond
description. in cottages and fields and along the highways the victims
of starvation lay dead by the hundreds, the relief which charity
afforded only bringing misery more sharply to the foreground. those who
were fortunate enough to secure passage money sought escape to america.
in 1844 the total immigration into the united states was less than
eighty thousand; in 1850 it had risen by leaps and bounds to more than
three hundred thousand. between 1820 and 1860 the immigrants from the
united kingdom numbered 2,750,000, of whom more than one-half were
irish. it has been said with a touch of exaggeration that the american
canals and railways of those days were built by the labor of irishmen.

_the german migration._--to political discontent and economic distress,
such as was responsible for the coming of the irish, may likewise be
traced the source of the germanic migration. the potato blight that fell
upon ireland visited the rhine valley and southern germany at the same
time with results as pitiful, if less extensive. the calamity inflicted
by nature was followed shortly by another inflicted by the despotic
conduct of german kings and princes. in 1848 there had occurred
throughout europe a popular uprising in behalf of republics and
democratic government. for a time it rode on a full tide of success.
kings were overthrown, or compelled to promise constitutional
government, and tyrannical ministers fled from their palaces. then came
reaction. those who had championed the popular cause were imprisoned,
shot, or driven out of the land. men of attainments and distinction,
whose sole offense was opposition to the government of kings and
princes, sought an asylum in america, carrying with them to the land of
their adoption the spirit of liberty and democracy. in 1847 over fifty
thousand germans came to america, the forerunners of a migration that
increased, almost steadily, for many years. the record of 1860 showed
that in the previous twenty years nearly a million and a half had found
homes in the united states. far and wide they scattered, from the mills
and shops of the seacoast towns to the uttermost frontiers of wisconsin
and minnesota.

_the labor of women and children._--if the industries, canals, and
railways of the country were largely manned by foreign labor, still
important native sources must not be overlooked; above all, the women
and children of the new england textile districts. spinning and weaving,
by a tradition that runs far beyond the written records of mankind,
belonged to women. indeed it was the dexterous housewives, spinsters,
and boys and girls that laid the foundations of the textile industry in
america, foundations upon which the mechanical revolution was built. as
the wheel and loom were taken out of the homes to the factories operated
by water power or the steam engine, the women and, to use hamilton's
phrase, "the children of tender years," followed as a matter of course.
"the cotton manufacture alone employs six thousand persons in lowell,"
wrote a french observer in 1836; "of this number nearly five thousand
are young women from seventeen to twenty-four years of age, the
daughters of farmers from the different new england states." it was not
until after the middle of the century that foreign lands proved to be
the chief source from which workers were recruited for the factories of
new england. it was then that the daughters of the puritans, outdone by
the competition of foreign labor, both of men and women, left the
spinning jenny and the loom to other hands.

=the rise of organized labor.=--the changing conditions of american
life, marked by the spreading mill towns of new england, new york, and
pennsylvania and the growth of cities like buffalo, cincinnati,
louisville, st. louis, detroit, and chicago in the west, naturally
brought changes, as jefferson had prophesied, in "manners and morals." a
few mechanics, smiths, carpenters, and masons, widely scattered through
farming regions and rural villages, raise no such problems as tens of
thousands of workers collected in one center in daily intercourse,
learning the power of cooperation and union.

even before the coming of steam and machinery, in the "good old days" of
handicrafts, laborers in many trades--printers, shoemakers, carpenters,
for example--had begun to draw together in the towns for the advancement
of their interests in the form of higher wages, shorter days, and
milder laws. the shoemakers of philadelphia, organized in 1794,
conducted a strike in 1799 and held together until indicted seven years
later for conspiracy. during the twenties and thirties, local labor
unions sprang up in all industrial centers and they led almost
immediately to city federations of the several crafts.

as the thousands who were dependent upon their daily labor for their
livelihood mounted into the millions and industries spread across the
continent, the local unions of craftsmen grew into national craft
organizations bound together by the newspapers, the telegraph, and the
railways. before 1860 there were several such national trade unions,
including the plumbers, printers, mule spinners, iron molders, and stone
cutters. all over the north labor leaders arose--men unknown to general
history but forceful and resourceful characters who forged links binding
scattered and individual workers into a common brotherhood. an attempt
was even made in 1834 to federate all the crafts into a permanent
national organization; but it perished within three years through lack
of support. half a century had to elapse before the american federation
of labor was to accomplish this task.

all the manifestations of the modern labor movement had appeared, in
germ at least, by the time the mid-century was reached: unions, labor
leaders, strikes, a labor press, a labor political program, and a labor
political party. in every great city industrial disputes were a common
occurrence. the papers recorded about four hundred in two years,
1853-54, local affairs but forecasting economic struggles in a larger
field. the labor press seems to have begun with the founding of the
_mechanics' free press_ in philadelphia in 1828 and the establishment of
the new york _workingman's advocate_ shortly afterward. these
semi-political papers were in later years followed by regular trade
papers designed to weld together and advance the interests of particular
crafts. edited by able leaders, these little sheets with limited
circulation wielded an enormous influence in the ranks of the workers.

=labor and politics.=--as for the political program of labor, the main
planks were clear and specific: the abolition of imprisonment for debt,
manhood suffrage in states where property qualifications still
prevailed, free and universal education, laws protecting the safety and
health of workers in mills and factories, abolition of lotteries, repeal
of laws requiring militia service, and free land in the west.

into the labor papers and platforms there sometimes crept a note of
hostility to the masters of industry, a sign of bitterness that excited
little alarm while cheap land in the west was open to the discontented.
the philadelphia workmen, in issuing a call for a local convention,
invited "all those of our fellow citizens who live by their own labor
and none other." in newcastle county, delaware, the association of
working people complained in 1830: "the poor have no laws; the laws are
made by the rich and of course for the rich." here and there an
extremist went to the length of advocating an equal division of wealth
among all the people--the crudest kind of communism.

agitation of this character produced in labor circles profound distrust
of both whigs and democrats who talked principally about tariffs and
banks; it resulted in attempts to found independent labor parties. in
philadelphia, albany, new york city, and new england, labor candidates
were put up for elections in the early thirties and in a few cases were
victorious at the polls. "the balance of power has at length got into
the hands of the working people, where it properly belongs,"
triumphantly exclaimed the _mechanics' free press_ of philadelphia in
1829. but the triumph was illusory. dissensions appeared in the labor
ranks. the old party leaders, particularly of tammany hall, the
democratic party organization in new york city, offered concessions to
labor in return for votes. newspapers unsparingly denounced "trade union
politicians" as "demagogues," "levellers," and "rag, tag, and bobtail";
and some of them, deeming labor unrest the sour fruit of manhood
suffrage, suggested disfranchisement as a remedy. under the influence
of concessions and attacks the political fever quickly died away, and
the end of the decade left no remnant of the labor political parties.
labor leaders turned to a task which seemed more substantial and
practical, that of organizing workingmen into craft unions for the
definite purpose of raising wages and reducing hours.


the industrial revolution and national politics

=southern plans for union with the west.=--it was long the design of
southern statesmen like calhoun to hold the west and the south together
in one political party. the theory on which they based their hope was
simple. both sections were agricultural--the producers of raw materials
and the buyers of manufactured goods. the planters were heavy purchasers
of western bacon, pork, mules, and grain. the mississippi river and its
tributaries formed the natural channel for the transportation of heavy
produce southward to the plantations and outward to europe. therefore,
ran their political reasoning, the interests of the two sections were
one. by standing together in favor of low tariffs, they could buy their
manufactures cheaply in europe and pay for them in cotton, tobacco, and
grain. the union of the two sections under jackson's management seemed
perfect.

=the east forms ties with the west.=--eastern leaders were not blind to
the ambitions of southern statesmen. on the contrary, they also
recognized the importance of forming strong ties with the agrarian west
and drawing the produce of the ohio valley to philadelphia and new york.
the canals and railways were the physical signs of this economic union,
and the results, commercial and political, were soon evident. by the
middle of the century, southern economists noted the change, one of
them, de bow, lamenting that "the great cities of the north have
severally penetrated the interior with artificial lines until they have
taken from the open and untaxed current of the mississippi the commerce
produced on its borders." to this writer it was an astounding thing to
behold "the number of steamers that now descend the upper mississippi
river, loaded to the guards with produce, as far as the mouth of the
illinois river and then turn up that stream with their cargoes to be
shipped to new york _via_ chicago. the illinois canal has not only swept
the whole produce along the line of the illinois river to the east, but
it is drawing the products of the upper mississippi through the same
channel; thus depriving new orleans and st. louis of a rich portion of
their former trade."

if to any shippers the broad current of the great river sweeping down to
new orleans offered easier means of physical communication to the sea
than the canals and railways, the difference could be overcome by the
credit which eastern bankers were able to extend to the grain and
produce buyers, in the first instance, and through them to the farmers
on the soil. the acute southern observer just quoted, de bow, admitted
with evident regret, in 1852, that "last autumn, the rich regions of
ohio, indiana, and illinois were flooded with the local bank notes of
the eastern states, advanced by the new york houses on produce to be
shipped by way of the canals in the spring.... these moneyed facilities
enable the packer, miller, and speculator to hold on to their produce
until the opening of navigation in the spring and they are no longer
obliged, as formerly, to hurry off their shipments during the winter by
the way of new orleans in order to realize funds by drafts on their
shipments. the banking facilities at the east are doing as much to draw
trade from us as the canals and railways which eastern capital is
constructing." thus canals, railways, and financial credit were swiftly
forging bonds of union between the old home of jacksonian democracy in
the west and the older home of federalism in the east. the nationalism
to which webster paid eloquent tribute became more and more real with
the passing of time. the self-sufficiency of the pioneer was broken down
as he began to watch the produce markets of new york and philadelphia
where the prices of corn and hogs fixed his earnings for the year.

=the west and manufactures.=--in addition to the commercial bonds
between the east and the west there was growing up a common interest in
manufactures. as skilled white labor increased in the ohio valley, the
industries springing up in the new cities made western life more like
that of the industrial east than like that of the planting south.
moreover, the western states produced some important raw materials for
american factories, which called for protection against foreign
competition, notably, wool, hemp, and flax. as the south had little or
no foreign competition in cotton and tobacco, the east could not offer
protection for her raw materials in exchange for protection for
industries. with the west, however, it became possible to establish
reciprocity in tariffs; that is, for example, to trade a high rate on
wool for a high rate on textiles or iron.

=the south dependent on the north.=--while east and west were drawing
together, the distinctions between north and south were becoming more
marked; the latter, having few industries and producing little save raw
materials, was being forced into the position of a dependent section. as
a result of the protective tariff, southern planters were compelled to
turn more and more to northern mills for their cloth, shoes, hats, hoes,
plows, and machinery. nearly all the goods which they bought in europe
in exchange for their produce came overseas to northern ports, whence
transshipments were made by rail and water to southern points of
distribution. their rice, cotton, and tobacco, in as far as they were
not carried to europe in british bottoms, were transported by northern
masters. in these ways, a large part of the financial operations
connected with the sale of southern produce and the purchase of goods in
exchange passed into the hands of northern merchants and bankers who,
naturally, made profits from their transactions. finally, southern
planters who wanted to buy more land and more slaves on credit borrowed
heavily in the north where huge accumulations made the rates of interest
lower than the smaller banks of the south could afford.

=the south reckons the cost of economic dependence.=--as southern
dependence upon northern capital became more and more marked, southern
leaders began to chafe at what they regarded as restraints laid upon
their enterprise. in a word, they came to look upon the planter as a
tribute-bearer to the manufacturer and financier. "the south,"
expostulated de bow, "stands in the attitude of feeding ... a vast
population of [northern] merchants, shipowners, capitalists, and others
who, without claims on her progeny, drink up the life blood of her
trade.... where goes the value of our labor but to those who, taking
advantage of our folly, ship for us, buy for us, sell to us, and, after
turning our own capital to their profitable account, return laden with
our money to enjoy their easily earned opulence at home."

southern statisticians, not satisfied with generalities, attempted to
figure out how great was this tribute in dollars and cents. they
estimated that the planters annually lent to northern merchants the full
value of their exports, a hundred millions or more, "to be used in the
manipulation of foreign imports." they calculated that no less than
forty millions all told had been paid to shipowners in profits. they
reckoned that, if the south were to work up her own cotton, she would
realize from seventy to one hundred millions a year that otherwise went
north. finally, to cap the climax, they regretted that planters spent
some fifteen millions a year pleasure-seeking in the alluring cities and
summer resorts of the north.

=southern opposition to northern policies.=--proceeding from these
premises, southern leaders drew the logical conclusion that the entire
program of economic measures demanded in the north was without exception
adverse to southern interests and, by a similar chain of reasoning,
injurious to the corn and wheat producers of the west. cheap labor
afforded by free immigration, a protective tariff raising prices of
manufactures for the tiller of the soil, ship subsidies increasing the
tonnage of carrying trade in northern hands, internal improvements
forging new economic bonds between the east and the west, a national
banking system giving strict national control over the currency as a
safeguard against paper inflation--all these devices were regarded in
the south as contrary to the planting interest. they were constantly
compared with the restrictive measures by which great britain more than
half a century before had sought to bind american interests.

as oppression justified a war for independence once, statesmen argued,
so it can justify it again. "it is curious as it is melancholy and
distressing," came a broad hint from south carolina, "to see how
striking is the analogy between the colonial vassalage to which the
manufacturing states have reduced the planting states and that which
formerly bound the anglo-american colonies to the british empire....
england said to her american colonies: 'you shall not trade with the
rest of the world for such manufactures as are produced in the mother
country.' the manufacturing states say to their southern colonies: 'you
shall not trade with the rest of the world for such manufactures as we
produce.'" the conclusion was inexorable: either the south must control
the national government and its economic measures, or it must declare,
as america had done four score years before, its political and economic
independence. as northern mills multiplied, as railways spun their
mighty web over the face of the north, and as accumulated capital rose
into the hundreds of millions, the conviction of the planters and their
statesmen deepened into desperation.

=efforts to start southern industries fail.=--a few of them, seeing the
predominance of the north, made determined efforts to introduce
manufactures into the south. to the leaders who were averse to secession
and nullification this seemed the only remedy for the growing disparity
in the power of the two sections. societies for the encouragement of
mechanical industries were formed, the investment of capital was sought,
and indeed a few mills were built on southern soil. the results were
meager. the natural resources, coal and water power, were abundant; but
the enterprise for direction and the skilled labor were wanting. the
stream of european immigration flowed north and west, not south. the
irish or german laborer, even if he finally made his home in a city, had
before him, while in the north, the alternative of a homestead on
western land. to him slavery was a strange, if not a repelling,
institution. he did not take to it kindly nor care to fix his home where
it flourished. while slavery lasted, the economy of the south was
inevitably agricultural. while agriculture predominated, leadership with
equal necessity fell to the planting interest. while the planting
interest ruled, political opposition to northern economy was destined to
grow in strength.

=the southern theory of sectionalism.=--in the opinion of the statesmen
who frankly represented the planting interest, the industrial system was
its deadly enemy. their entire philosophy of american politics was
summed up in a single paragraph by mcduffie, a spokesman for south
carolina: "owing to the federative character of our government, the
great geographical extent of our territory, and the diversity of the
pursuits of our citizens in different parts of the union, it has so
happened that two great interests have sprung up, standing directly
opposed to each other. one of these consists of those manufactures which
the northern and middle states are capable of producing but which, owing
to the high price of labor and the high profits of capital in those
states, cannot hold competition with foreign manufactures without the
aid of bounties, directly or indirectly given, either by the general
government or by the state governments. the other of these interests
consists of the great agricultural staples of the southern states which
can find a market only in foreign countries and which can be
advantageously sold only in exchange for foreign manufactures which come
in competition with those of the northern and middle states.... these
interests then stand diametrically and irreconcilably opposed to each
other. the interest, the pecuniary interest of the northern
manufacturer, is directly promoted by every increase of the taxes
imposed upon southern commerce; and it is unnecessary to add that the
interest of the southern planter is promoted by every diminution of
taxes imposed upon the productions of their industry. if, under these
circumstances, the manufacturers were clothed with the power of imposing
taxes, at their pleasure, upon the foreign imports of the planter, no
doubt would exist in the mind of any man that it would have all the
characteristics of an absolute and unqualified despotism." the economic
soundness of this reasoning, a subject of interesting speculation for
the economist, is of little concern to the historian. the historical
point is that this opinion was widely held in the south and with the
progress of time became the prevailing doctrine of the planting
statesmen.

their antagonism was deepened because they also became convinced, on
what grounds it is not necessary to inquire, that the leaders of the
industrial interest thus opposed to planting formed a consolidated
"aristocracy of wealth," bent upon the pursuit and attainment of
political power at washington. "by the aid of various associated
interests," continued mcduffie, "the manufacturing capitalists have
obtained a complete and permanent control over the legislation of
congress on this subject [the tariff].... men confederated together upon
selfish and interested principles, whether in pursuit of the offices or
the bounties of the government, are ever more active and vigilant than
the great majority who act from disinterested and patriotic impulses.
have we not witnessed it on this floor, sir? who ever knew the tariff
men to divide on any question affecting their confederated interests?...
the watchword is, stick together, right or wrong upon every question
affecting the common cause. such, sir, is the concert and vigilance and
such the combinations by which the manufacturing party, acting upon the
interests of some and the prejudices of others, have obtained a decided
and permanent control over public opinion in all the tariff states."
thus, as the southern statesman would have it, the north, in matters
affecting national policies, was ruled by a "confederated interest"
which menaced the planting interest. as the former grew in magnitude and
attached to itself the free farmers of the west through channels of
trade and credit, it followed as night the day that in time the planters
would be overshadowed and at length overborne in the struggle of giants.
whether the theory was sound or not, southern statesmen believed it and
acted upon it.

chapter xiv

the planting system and national politics


james madison, the father of the federal constitution, after he had
watched for many days the battle royal in the national convention of
1787, exclaimed that the contest was not between the large and the small
states, but between the commercial north and the planting south. from
the inauguration of washington to the election of lincoln the sectional
conflict, discerned by this penetrating thinker, exercised a profound
influence on the course of american politics. it was latent during the
"era of good feeling" when the jeffersonian republicans adopted
federalist policies; it flamed up in the contest between the democrats
and whigs. finally it raged in the angry political quarrel which
culminated in the civil war.


slavery--north and south

=the decline of slavery in the north.=--at the time of the adoption of
the constitution, slavery was lawful in all the northern states except
massachusetts. there were almost as many bondmen in new york as in
georgia. new jersey had more than delaware or tennessee, indeed nearly
as many as both combined. all told, however, there were only about forty
thousand in the north as against nearly seven hundred thousand in the
south. moreover, most of the northern slaves were domestic servants, not
laborers necessary to keep mills going or fields under cultivation.

there was, in the north, a steadily growing moral sentiment against the
system. massachusetts abandoned it in 1780. in the same year,
pennsylvania provided for gradual emancipation. new hampshire, where
there had been only a handful, connecticut with a few thousand
domestics, and new jersey early followed these examples. new york, in
1799, declared that all children born of slaves after july 4 of that
year should be free, though held for a term as apprentices; and in 1827
it swept away the last vestiges of slavery. so with the passing of the
generation that had framed the constitution, chattel servitude
disappeared in the commercial states, leaving behind only such
discriminations as disfranchisement or high property qualifications on
colored voters.

=the growth of northern sentiment against slavery.=--in both sections of
the country there early existed, among those more or less
philosophically inclined, a strong opposition to slavery on moral as
well as economic grounds. in the constitutional convention of 1787,
gouverneur morris had vigorously condemned it and proposed that the
whole country should bear the cost of abolishing it. about the same time
a society for promoting the abolition of slavery, under the presidency
of benjamin franklin, laid before congress a petition that serious
attention be given to the emancipation of "those unhappy men who alone
in this land of freedom are degraded into perpetual bondage." when
congress, acting on the recommendations of president jefferson, provided
for the abolition of the foreign slave trade on january 1, 1808, several
northern members joined with southern members in condemning the system
as well as the trade. later, colonization societies were formed to
encourage the emancipation of slaves and their return to africa. james
madison was president and henry clay vice president of such an
organization.

the anti-slavery sentiment of which these were the signs was
nevertheless confined to narrow circles and bore no trace of bitterness.

"we consider slavery your calamity, not your crime," wrote a
distinguished boston clergyman to his southern brethren, "and we will
share with you the burden of putting an end to it. we will consent that
the public lands shall be appropriated to this object.... i deprecate
everything which sows discord and exasperating sectional animosities."

=uncompromising abolition.=--in a little while the spirit of generosity
was gone. just as jacksonian democracy rose to power there appeared a
new kind of anti-slavery doctrine--the dogmatism of the abolition
agitator. for mild speculation on the evils of the system was
substituted an imperious and belligerent demand for instant
emancipation. if a date must be fixed for its appearance, the year 1831
may be taken when william lloyd garrison founded in boston his
anti-slavery paper, _the liberator_. with singleness of purpose and
utter contempt for all opposing opinions and arguments, he pursued his
course of passionate denunciation. he apologized for having ever
"assented to the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition."
he chose for his motto: "immediate and unconditional emancipation!" he
promised his readers that he would be "harsh as truth and uncompromising
as justice"; that he would not "think or speak or write with
moderation." then he flung out his defiant call: "i am in earnest--i
will not equivocate--i will not excuse--i will not retreat a single
inch--and i will be heard....

     'such is the vow i take, so help me god.'"

though garrison complained that "the apathy of the people is enough to
make every statue leap from its pedestal," he soon learned how alive the
masses were to the meaning of his propaganda. abolition orators were
stoned in the street and hissed from the platform. their meeting places
were often attacked and sometimes burned to the ground. garrison himself
was assaulted in the streets of boston, finding refuge from the angry
mob behind prison bars. lovejoy, a publisher in alton, illinois, for his
willingness to give abolition a fair hearing, was brutally murdered; his
printing press was broken to pieces as a warning to all those who
disturbed the nation's peace of mind. the south, doubly frightened by a
slave revolt in 1831 which ended in the murder of a number of men,
women, and children, closed all discussion of slavery in that section.
"now," exclaimed calhoun, "it is a question which admits of neither
concession nor compromise."

as the opposition hardened, the anti-slavery agitation gathered in force
and intensity. whittier blew his blast from the new england hills:

    "no slave-hunt in our borders--no pirate on our strand;
     no fetters in the bay state--no slave upon our land."

lowell, looking upon the espousal of a great cause as the noblest aim of
his art, ridiculed and excoriated bondage in the south. those
abolitionists, not gifted as speakers or writers, signed petitions
against slavery and poured them in upon congress. the flood of them was
so continuous that the house of representatives, forgetting its
traditions, adopted in 1836 a "gag rule" which prevented the reading of
appeals and consigned them to the waste basket. not until the whigs were
in power nearly ten years later was john quincy adams able, after a
relentless campaign, to carry a motion rescinding the rule.

how deep was the impression made upon the country by this agitation for
immediate and unconditional emancipation cannot be measured. if the
popular vote for those candidates who opposed not slavery, but its
extension to the territories, be taken as a standard, it was slight
indeed. in 1844, the free soil candidate, birney, polled 62,000 votes
out of over a million and a half; the free soil vote of the next
campaign went beyond a quarter of a million, but the increase was due to
the strength of the leader, martin van buren; four years afterward it
receded to 156,000, affording all the outward signs for the belief that
the pleas of the abolitionist found no widespread response among the
people. yet the agitation undoubtedly ran deeper than the ballot box.
young statesmen of the north, in whose hands the destiny of frightful
years was to lie, found their indifference to slavery broken and their
consciences stirred by the unending appeal and the tireless reiteration.
charles sumner afterward boasted that he read the _liberator_ two years
before wendell phillips, the young boston lawyer who cast aside his
profession to take up the dangerous cause.

=early southern opposition to slavery.=--in the south, the sentiment
against slavery was strong; it led some to believe that it would also
come to an end there in due time. washington disliked it and directed in
his will that his own slaves should be set free after the death of his
wife. jefferson, looking into the future, condemned the system by which
he also lived, saying: "can the liberties of a nation be thought secure
when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of
the people that their liberties are the gift of god? are they not to be
violated but with his wrath? indeed i tremble for my country when i
reflect that god is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever." nor
did southern men confine their sentiments to expressions of academic
opinion. they accepted in 1787 the ordinance which excluded slavery from
the northwest territory forever and also the missouri compromise, which
shut it out of a vast section of the louisiana territory.

=the revolution in the slave system.=--among the representatives of
south carolina and georgia, however, the anti-slavery views of
washington and jefferson were by no means approved; and the drift of
southern economy was decidedly in favor of extending and perpetuating,
rather than abolishing, the system of chattel servitude. the invention
of the cotton gin and textile machinery created a market for cotton
which the planters, with all their skill and energy, could hardly
supply. almost every available acre was brought under cotton culture as
the small farmers were driven steadily from the seaboard into the
uplands or to the northwest.

the demand for slaves to till the swiftly expanding fields was enormous.
the number of bondmen rose from 700,000 in washington's day to more than
three millions in 1850. at the same time slavery itself was transformed.
instead of the homestead where the same family of masters kept the same
families of slaves from generation to generation, came the plantation
system of the far south and southwest where masters were ever moving and
ever extending their holdings of lands and slaves. this in turn reacted
on the older south where the raising of slaves for the market became a
regular and highly profitable business.

[illustration: _from an old print_

john c. calhoun]

=slavery defended as a positive good.=--as the abolition agitation
increased and the planting system expanded, apologies for slavery became
fainter and fainter in the south. then apologies were superseded by
claims that slavery was a beneficial scheme of labor control. calhoun,
in a famous speech in the senate in 1837, sounded the new note by
declaring slavery "instead of an evil, a good--a positive good." his
reasoning was as follows: in every civilized society one portion of the
community must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the
arts are built upon leisure; the african slave, kindly treated by his
master and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than
the free laborers of europe; and under the slave system conflicts
between capital and labor are avoided. the advantages of slavery in this
respect, he concluded, "will become more and more manifest, if left
undisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in
wealth and numbers."

=slave owners dominate politics.=--the new doctrine of calhoun was
eagerly seized by the planters as they came more and more to overshadow
the small farmers of the south and as they beheld the menace of
abolition growing upon the horizon. it formed, as they viewed matters, a
moral defense for their labor system--sound, logical, invincible. it
warranted them in drawing together for the protection of an institution
so necessary, so inevitable, so beneficent.

though in 1850 the slave owners were only about three hundred and fifty
thousand in a national population of nearly twenty million whites, they
had an influence all out of proportion to their numbers. they were knit
together by the bonds of a common interest. they had leisure and wealth.
they could travel and attend conferences and conventions. throughout the
south and largely in the north, they had the press, the schools, and the
pulpits on their side. they formed, as it were, a mighty union for the
protection and advancement of their common cause. aided by those
mechanics and farmers of the north who stuck by jacksonian democracy
through thick and thin, the planters became a power in the federal
government. "we nominate presidents," exultantly boasted a richmond
newspaper; "the north elects them."

this jubilant southern claim was conceded by william h. seward, a
republican senator from new york, in a speech describing the power of
slavery in the national government. "a party," he said, "is in one sense
a joint stock association, in which those who contribute most direct the
action and management of the concern.... the slaveholders, contributing
in an overwhelming proportion to the strength of the democratic party,
necessarily dictate and prescribe its policy." he went on: "the
slaveholding class has become the governing power in each of the
slaveholding states and it practically chooses thirty of the sixty-two
members of the senate, ninety of the two hundred and thirty-three
members of the house of representatives, and one hundred and five of the
two hundred and ninety-five electors of president and vice-president of
the united states." then he considered the slave power in the supreme
court. "that tribunal," he exclaimed, "consists of a chief justice and
eight associate justices. of these, five were called from slave states
and four from free states. the opinions and bias of each of them were
carefully considered by the president and senate when he was appointed.
not one of them was found wanting in soundness of politics, according to
the slaveholder's exposition of the constitution." such was the northern
view of the planting interest that, from the arena of national politics,
challenged the whole country in 1860.

slavery in national politics

=national aspects of slavery.=--it may be asked why it was that slavery,
founded originally on state law and subject to state government, was
drawn into the current of national affairs. the answer is simple. there
were, in the first place, constitutional reasons. the congress of the
united states had to make all needful rules for the government of the
territories, the district of columbia, the forts and other property
under national authority; so it was compelled to determine whether
slavery should exist in the places subject to its jurisdiction. upon
congress was also conferred the power of admitting new states; whenever
a territory asked for admission, the issue could be raised as to whether
slavery should be sanctioned or excluded. under the constitution,
provision was made for the return of runaway slaves; congress had the
power to enforce this clause by appropriate legislation. since the
control of the post office was vested in the federal government, it had
to face the problem raised by the transmission of abolition literature
through the mails. finally citizens had the right of petition; it
inheres in all free government and it is expressly guaranteed by the
first amendment to the constitution. it was therefore legal for
abolitionists to present to congress their petitions, even if they asked
for something which it had no right to grant. it was thus impossible,
constitutionally, to draw a cordon around the slavery issue and confine
the discussion of it to state politics.

there were, in the second place, economic reasons why slavery was
inevitably drawn into the national sphere. it was the basis of the
planting system which had direct commercial relations with the north and
european countries; it was affected by federal laws respecting tariffs,
bounties, ship subsidies, banking, and kindred matters. the planters of
the south, almost without exception, looked upon the protective tariff
as a tribute laid upon them for the benefit of northern industries. as
heavy borrowers of money in the north, they were generally in favor of
"easy money," if not paper currency, as an aid in the repayment of their
debts. this threw most of them into opposition to the whig program for a
united states bank. all financial aids to american shipping they stoutly
resisted, preferring to rely upon the cheaper service rendered by
english shippers. internal improvements, those substantial ties that
were binding the west to the east and turning the traffic from new
orleans to philadelphia and new york, they viewed with alarm. free
homesteads from the public lands, which tended to overbalance the south
by building free states, became to them a measure dangerous to their
interests. thus national economic policies, which could not by any twist
or turn be confined to state control, drew the slave system and its
defenders into the political conflict that centered at washington.

=slavery and the territories--the missouri compromise (1820).=--though
men continually talked about "taking slavery out of politics," it could
not be done. by 1818 slavery had become so entrenched and the
anti-slavery sentiment so strong, that missouri's quest for admission
brought both houses of congress into a deadlock that was broken only by
compromise. the south, having half the senators, could prevent the
admission of missouri stripped of slavery; and the north, powerful in
the house of representatives, could keep missouri with slavery out of
the union indefinitely. an adjustment of pretensions was the last
resort. maine, separated from the parent state of massachusetts, was
brought into the union with freedom and missouri with bondage. at the
same time it was agreed that the remainder of the vast louisiana
territory north of the parallel of 36 o 30' should be, like the old
northwest, forever free; while the southern portion was left to slavery.
in reality this was an immense gain for liberty. the area dedicated to
free farmers was many times greater than that left to the planters. the
principle was once more asserted that congress had full power to prevent
slavery in the territories.

[illustration: the missouri compromise]

=the territorial question reopened by the wilmot proviso.=--to the
southern leaders, the annexation of texas and the conquest of mexico
meant renewed security to the planting interest against the increasing
wealth and population of the north. texas, it was said, could be divided
into four slave states. the new territories secured by the treaty of
peace with mexico contained the promise of at least three more. thus, as
each new free soil state knocked for admission into the union, the
south could demand as the price of its consent a new slave state. no
wonder southern statesmen saw, in the annexation of texas and the
conquest of mexico, slavery and king cotton triumphant--secure for all
time against adverse legislation. northern leaders were equally
convinced that the southern prophecy was true. abolitionists and
moderate opponents of slavery alike were in despair. texas, they
lamented, would fasten slavery upon the country forevermore. "no living
man," cried one, "will see the end of slavery in the united states!"

it so happened, however, that the events which, it was thought, would
secure slavery let loose a storm against it. a sign appeared first on
august 6, 1846, only a few months after war was declared on mexico. on
that day, david wilmot, a democrat from pennsylvania, introduced into
the house of representatives a resolution to the effect that, as an
express and fundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory
from the republic of mexico, slavery should be forever excluded from
every part of it. "the wilmot proviso," as the resolution was popularly
called, though defeated on that occasion, was a challenge to the south.

the south answered the challenge. speaking in the house of
representatives, robert toombs of georgia boldly declared: "in the
presence of the living god, if by your legislation you seek to drive us
from the territories of california and new mexico ... i am for
disunion." south carolina announced that the day for talk had passed and
the time had come to join her sister states "in resisting the
application of the wilmot proviso at any and all hazards." a conference,
assembled at jackson, mississippi, in the autumn of 1849, called a
general convention of southern states to meet at nashville the following
summer. the avowed purpose was to arrest "the course of aggression" and,
if that was not possible, to provide "in the last resort for their
separate welfare by the formation of a compact and union that will
afford protection to their liberties and rights." states that had
spurned south carolina's plea for nullification in 1832 responded to
this new appeal with alacrity--an augury of the secession to come.

=the great debate of 1850.=--the temper of the country was white hot
when congress convened in december, 1849. it was a memorable session,
memorable for the great men who took part in the debates and memorable
for the grand compromise of 1850 which it produced. in the senate sat
for the last time three heroic figures: webster from the north, calhoun
from the south, and clay from a border state. for nearly forty years
these three had been leaders of men. all had grown old and gray in
service. calhoun was already broken in health and in a few months was to
be borne from the political arena forever. clay and webster had but two
more years in their allotted span.

experience, learning, statecraft--all these things they now marshaled in
a mighty effort to solve the slavery problem. on january 29, 1850, clay
offered to the senate a compromise granting concessions to both sides;
and a few days later, in a powerful oration, he made a passionate appeal
for a union of hearts through mutual sacrifices. calhoun relentlessly
demanded the full measure of justice for the south: equal rights in the
territories bought by common blood; the return of runaway slaves as
required by the constitution; the suppression of the abolitionists; and
the restoration of the balance of power between the north and the south.
webster, in his notable "seventh of march speech," condemned the wilmot
proviso, advocated a strict enforcement of the fugitive slave law,
denounced the abolitionists, and made a final plea for the constitution,
union, and liberty. this was the address which called forth from
whittier the poem, "ichabod," deploring the fall of the mighty one whom
he thought lost to all sense of faith and honor.

=the terms of the compromise of 1850.=--when the debates were closed,
the results were totaled in a series of compromise measures, all of
which were signed in september, 1850, by the new president, millard
fillmore, who had taken office two months before on the death of zachary
taylor. by these acts the boundaries of texas were adjusted and the
territory of new mexico created, subject to the provision that all or
any part of it might be admitted to the union "with or without slavery
as their constitution may provide at the time of their admission." the
territory of utah was similarly organized with the same conditions as to
slavery, thus repudiating the wilmot proviso without guaranteeing
slavery to the planters. california was admitted as a free state under a
constitution in which the people of the territory had themselves
prohibited slavery.

the slave trade was abolished in the district of columbia, but slavery
itself existed as before at the capital of the nation. this concession
to anti-slavery sentiment was more than offset by a fugitive slave law,
drastic in spirit and in letter. it placed the enforcement of its terms
in the hands of federal officers appointed from washington and so
removed it from the control of authorities locally elected. it provided
that masters or their agents, on filing claims in due form, might
summarily remove their escaped slaves without affording their "alleged
fugitives" the right of trial by jury, the right to witness, the right
to offer any testimony in evidence. finally, to "put teeth" into the
act, heavy penalties were prescribed for all who obstructed or assisted
in obstructing the enforcement of the law. such was the great compromise
of 1850.

[illustration: an old cartoon representing webster "stealing clay's
thunder"]

=the pro-slavery triumph in the election of 1852.=--the results of the
election of 1852 seemed to show conclusively that the nation was weary
of slavery agitation and wanted peace. both parties, whigs and
democrats, endorsed the fugitive slave law and approved the great
compromise. the democrats, with franklin pierce as their leader, swept
the country against the war hero, general winfield scott, on whom the
whigs had staked their hopes. even webster, broken with grief at his
failure to receive the nomination, advised his friends to vote for
pierce and turned away from politics to meditate upon approaching death.
the verdict of the voters would seem to indicate that for the time
everybody, save a handful of disgruntled agitators, looked upon clay's
settlement as the last word. "the people, especially the business men of
the country," says elson, "were utterly weary of the agitation and they
gave their suffrages to the party that promised them rest." the free
soil party, condemning slavery as "a sin against god and a crime against
man," and advocating freedom for the territories, failed to carry a
single state. in fact it polled fewer votes than it had four years
earlier--156,000 as against nearly 3,000,000, the combined vote of the
whigs and democrats. it is not surprising, therefore, that president
pierce, surrounded in his cabinet by strong southern sympathizers, could
promise to put an end to slavery agitation and to crush the abolition
movement in the bud.

=anti-slavery agitation continued.=--the promise was more difficult to
fulfill than to utter. in fact, the vigorous execution of one measure
included in the compromise--the fugitive slave law--only made matters
worse. designed as security for the planters, it proved a powerful
instrument in their undoing. slavery five hundred miles away on a
louisiana plantation was so remote from the north that only the
strongest imagination could maintain a constant rage against it. "slave
catching," "man hunting" by federal officers on the streets of
philadelphia, new york, boston, chicago, or milwaukee and in the hamlets
and villages of the wide-stretching farm lands of the north was another
matter. it brought the most odious aspects of slavery home to thousands
of men and women who would otherwise have been indifferent to the
system. law-abiding business men, mechanics, farmers, and women, when
they saw peaceful negroes, who had resided in their neighborhoods
perhaps for years, torn away by federal officers and carried back to
bondage, were transformed into enemies of the law. they helped slaves to
escape; they snatched them away from officers who had captured them;
they broke open jails and carried fugitives off to canada.

assistance to runaway slaves, always more or less common in the north,
was by this time organized into a system. regular routes, known as
"underground railways," were laid out across the free states into
canada, and trusted friends of freedom maintained "underground stations"
where fugitives were concealed in the daytime between their long night
journeys. funds were raised and secret agents sent into the south to
help negroes to flee. one negro woman, harriet tubman, "the moses of her
people," with headquarters at philadelphia, is accredited with nineteen
invasions into slave territory and the emancipation of three hundred
negroes. those who worked at this business were in constant peril. one
underground operator, calvin fairbank, spent nearly twenty years in
prison for aiding fugitives from justice. yet perils and prisons did not
stay those determined men and women who, in obedience to their
consciences, set themselves to this lawless work.

[illustration: harriet beecher stowe]

from thrilling stories of adventure along the underground railways came
some of the scenes and themes of the novel by harriet beecher stowe,
"uncle tom's cabin," published two years after the compromise of 1850.
her stirring tale set forth the worst features of slavery in vivid word
pictures that caught and held the attention of millions of readers.
though the book was unfair to the south and was denounced as a hideous
distortion of the truth, it was quickly dramatized and played in every
city and town throughout the north. topsy, little eva, uncle tom, the
fleeing slave, eliza harris, and the cruel slave driver, simon legree,
with his baying blood hounds, became living specters in many a home that
sought to bar the door to the "unpleasant and irritating business of
slavery agitation."


the drift of events toward the irrepressible conflict

=repeal of the missouri compromise.=--to practical men, after all, the
"rub-a-dub" agitation of a few abolitionists, an occasional riot over
fugitive slaves, and the vogue of a popular novel seemed of slight or
transient importance. they could point with satisfaction to the election
returns of 1852; but their very security was founded upon shifting
sands. the magnificent triumph of the pro-slavery democrats in 1852
brought a turn in affairs that destroyed the foundations under their
feet. emboldened by their own strength and the weakness of their
opponents, they now dared to repeal the missouri compromise. the leader
in this fateful enterprise was stephen a. douglas, senator from
illinois, and the occasion for the deed was the demand for the
organization of territorial government in the regions west of iowa and
missouri.

douglas, like clay and webster before him, was consumed by a strong
passion for the presidency, and, to reach his goal, it was necessary to
win the support of the south. this he undoubtedly sought to do when he
introduced on january 4, 1854, a bill organizing the nebraska territory
on the principle of the compromise of 1850; namely, that the people in
the territory might themselves decide whether they would have slavery or
not. unwittingly the avalanche was started.

after a stormy debate, in which important amendments were forced on
douglas, the kansas-nebraska bill became a law on may 30, 1854. the
measure created two territories, kansas and nebraska, and provided that
they, or territories organized out of them, could come into the union as
states "with or without slavery as their constitutions may prescribe at
the time of their admission." not content with this, the law went on to
declare the missouri compromise null and void as being inconsistent with
the principle of non-intervention by congress with slavery in the states
and territories. thus by a single blow the very heart of the continent,
dedicated to freedom by solemn agreement, was thrown open to slavery. a
desperate struggle between slave owners and the advocates of freedom was
the outcome in kansas.

if douglas fancied that the north would receive the overthrow of the
missouri compromise in the same temper that it greeted clay's
settlement, he was rapidly disillusioned. a blast of rage, terrific in
its fury, swept from maine to iowa. staid old boston hanged him in
effigy with an inscription--"stephen a. douglas, author of the infamous
nebraska bill: the benedict arnold of 1854." city after city burned him
in effigy until, as he himself said, he could travel from the atlantic
coast to chicago in the light of the fires. thousands of whigs and
free-soil democrats deserted their parties which had sanctioned or at
least tolerated the kansas-nebraska bill, declaring that the startling
measure showed an evident resolve on the part of the planters to rule
the whole country. a gage of defiance was thrown down to the
abolitionists. an issue was set even for the moderate and timid who had
been unmoved by the agitation over slavery in the far south. that issue
was whether slavery was to be confined within its existing boundaries or
be allowed to spread without interference, thereby placing the free
states in the minority and surrendering the federal government wholly to
the slave power.

=the rise of the republican party.=--events of terrible significance,
swiftly following, drove the country like a ship before a gale straight
into civil war. the kansas-nebraska bill rent the old parties asunder
and called into being the republican party. while that bill was pending
in congress, many northern whigs and democrats had come to the
conclusion that a new party dedicated to freedom in the territories must
follow the repeal of the missouri compromise. several places claim to be
the original home of the republican party; but historians generally
yield it to wisconsin. at ripon in that state, a mass meeting of whigs
and democrats assembled in february, 1854, and resolved to form a new
party if the kansas-nebraska bill should pass. at a second meeting a
fusion committee representing whigs, free soilers, and democrats was
formed and the name republican--the name of jefferson's old party--was
selected. all over the country similar meetings were held and political
committees were organized.

when the presidential campaign of 1856 began the republicans entered the
contest. after a preliminary conference in pittsburgh in february, they
held a convention in philadelphia at which was drawn up a platform
opposing the extension of slavery to the territories. john c. fremont,
the distinguished explorer, was named for the presidency. the results
of the election were astounding as compared with the free-soil failure
of the preceding election. prominent men like longfellow, washington
irving, william cullen bryant, ralph waldo emerson, and george william
curtis went over to the new party and 1,341,264 votes were rolled up for
"free labor, free speech, free men, free kansas, and fremont."
nevertheless the victory of the democrats was decisive. their candidate,
james buchanan of pennsylvania, was elected by a majority of 174 to 114
electoral votes.

[illustration: slave and free soil on eve of civil war]

=the dred scott decision (1857).=--in his inaugural, buchanan vaguely
hinted that in a forthcoming decision the supreme court would settle one
of the vital questions of the day. this was a reference to the dred
scott case then pending. scott was a slave who had been taken by his
master into the upper louisiana territory, where freedom had been
established by the missouri compromise, and then carried back into his
old state of missouri. he brought suit for his liberty on the ground
that his residence in the free territory made him free. this raised the
question whether the law of congress prohibiting slavery north of 36 o
30' was authorized by the federal constitution or not. the court might
have avoided answering it by saying that even though scott was free in
the territory, he became a slave again in missouri by virtue of the law
of that state. the court, however, faced the issue squarely. it held
that scott had not been free anywhere and that, besides, the missouri
compromise violated the constitution and was null and void.

the decision was a triumph for the south. it meant that congress after
all had no power to abolish slavery in the territories. under the decree
of the highest court in the land, that could be done only by an
amendment to the constitution which required a two-thirds vote in
congress and the approval of three-fourths of the states. such an
amendment was obviously impossible--the southern states were too
numerous; but the republicans were not daunted. "we know," said lincoln,
"the court that made it has often overruled its own decisions and we
shall do what we can to have it overrule this." legislatures of northern
states passed resolutions condemning the decision and the republican
platform of 1860 characterized the dogma that the constitution carried
slavery into the territories as "a dangerous political heresy at
variance with the explicit provisions of that instrument itself ... with
legislative and judicial precedent ... revolutionary in tendency and
subversive of the peace and harmony of the country."

=the panic of 1857.=--in the midst of the acrimonious dispute over the
dred scott decision, came one of the worst business panics which ever
afflicted the country. in the spring and summer of 1857, fourteen
railroad corporations, including the erie, michigan central, and the
illinois central, failed to meet their obligations; banks and insurance
companies, some of them the largest and strongest institutions in the
north, closed their doors; stocks and bonds came down in a crash on the
markets; manufacturing was paralyzed; tens of thousands of working
people were thrown out of employment; "hunger meetings" of idle men were
held in the cities and banners bearing the inscription, "we want
bread," were flung out. in new york, working men threatened to invade
the council chamber to demand "work or bread," and the frightened mayor
called for the police and soldiers. for this distressing state of
affairs many remedies were offered; none with more zeal and persistence
than the proposal for a higher tariff to take the place of the law of
march, 1857, a democratic measure making drastic reductions in the rates
of duty. in the manufacturing districts of the north, the panic was
ascribed to the "democratic assault on business." so an old issue was
again vigorously advanced, preparatory to the next presidential
campaign.

=the lincoln-douglas debates.=--the following year the interest of the
whole country was drawn to a series of debates held in illinois by
lincoln and douglas, both candidates for the united states senate. in
the course of his campaign lincoln had uttered his trenchant saying that
"a house divided against itself cannot stand. i believe this government
cannot endure permanently half slave and half free." at the same time he
had accused douglas, buchanan, and the supreme court of acting in
concert to make slavery national. this daring statement arrested the
attention of douglas, who was making his campaign on the doctrine of
"squatter sovereignty;" that is, the right of the people of each
territory "to vote slavery up or down." after a few long-distance shots
at each other, the candidates agreed to meet face to face and discuss
the issues of the day. never had such crowds been seen at political
meetings in illinois. farmers deserted their plows, smiths their forges,
and housewives their baking to hear "honest abe" and "the little giant."

the results of the series of debates were momentous. lincoln clearly
defined his position. the south, he admitted, was entitled under the
constitution to a fair, fugitive slave law. he hoped that there might be
no new slave states; but he did not see how congress could exclude the
people of a territory from admission as a state if they saw fit to adopt
a constitution legalizing the ownership of slaves. he favored the
gradual abolition of slavery in the district of columbia and the total
exclusion of it from the territories of the united states by act of
congress.

moreover, he drove douglas into a hole by asking how he squared
"squatter sovereignty" with the dred scott decision; how, in other
words, the people of a territory could abolish slavery when the court
had declared that congress, the superior power, could not do it under
the constitution? to this baffling question douglas lamely replied that
the inhabitants of a territory, by "unfriendly legislation," might make
property in slaves insecure and thus destroy the institution. this
answer to lincoln's query alienated many southern democrats who believed
that the dred scott decision settled the question of slavery in the
territories for all time. douglas won the election to the senate; but
lincoln, lifted into national fame by the debates, beat him in the
campaign for president two years later.

=john brown's raid.=--to the abolitionists the line of argument pursued
by lincoln, including his proposal to leave slavery untouched in the
states where it existed, was wholly unsatisfactory. one of them, a grim
and resolute man, inflamed by a hatred for slavery in itself, turned
from agitation to violence. "these men are all talk; what is needed is
action--action!" so spoke john brown of new york. during the sanguinary
struggle in kansas he hurried to the frontier, gun and dagger in hand,
to help drive slave owners from the free soil of the west. there he
committed deeds of such daring and cruelty that he was outlawed and a
price put upon his head. still he kept on the path of "action." aided by
funds from northern friends, he gathered a small band of his followers
around him, saying to them: "if god be for us, who can be against us?"
he went into virginia in the autumn of 1859, hoping, as he explained,
"to effect a mighty conquest even though it be like the last victory of
samson." he seized the government armory at harper's ferry, declared
free the slaves whom he found, and called upon them to take up arms in
defense of their liberty. his was a hope as forlorn as it was desperate.
armed forces came down upon him and, after a hard battle, captured him.
tried for treason, brown was condemned to death. the governor of
virginia turned a deaf ear to pleas for clemency based on the ground
that the prisoner was simply a lunatic. "this is a beautiful country,"
said the stern old brown glancing upward to the eternal hills on his way
to the gallows, as calmly as if he were returning home from a long
journey. "so perish all such enemies of virginia. all such enemies of
the union. all such foes of the human race," solemnly announced the
executioner as he fulfilled the judgment of the law.

the raid and its grim ending deeply moved the country. abolitionists
looked upon brown as a martyr and tolled funeral bells on the day of his
execution. longfellow wrote in his diary: "this will be a great day in
our history; the date of a new revolution as much needed as the old
one." jefferson davis saw in the affair "the invasion of a state by a
murderous gang of abolitionists bent on inciting slaves to murder
helpless women and children"--a crime for which the leader had met a
felon's death. lincoln spoke of the raid as absurd, the deed of an
enthusiast who had brooded over the oppression of a people until he
fancied himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them--an attempt
which ended in "little else than his own execution." to republican
leaders as a whole, the event was very embarrassing. they were taunted
by the democrats with responsibility for the deed. douglas declared his
"firm and deliberate conviction that the harper's ferry crime was the
natural, logical, inevitable result of the doctrines and teachings of
the republican party." so persistent were such attacks that the
republicans felt called upon in 1860 to denounce brown's raid "as among
the gravest of crimes."

=the democrats divided.=--when the democratic convention met at
charleston in the spring of 1860, a few months after brown's execution,
it soon became clear that there was danger ahead. between the extreme
slavery advocates of the far south and the so-called pro-slavery
democrats of the douglas type, there was a chasm which no appeals to
party loyalty could bridge. as the spokesman of the west, douglas knew
that, while the north was not abolitionist, it was passionately set
against an extension of slavery into the territories by act of congress;
that squatter sovereignty was the mildest kind of compromise acceptable
to the farmers whose votes would determine the fate of the election.
southern leaders would not accept his opinion. yancey, speaking for
alabama, refused to palter with any plan not built on the proposition
that slavery was in itself right. he taunted the northern democrats with
taking the view that slavery was wrong, but that they could not do
anything about it. that, he said, was the fatal error--the cause of all
discord, the source of "black republicanism," as well as squatter
sovereignty. the gauntlet was thus thrown down at the feet of the
northern delegates: "you must not apologize for slavery; you must
declare it right; you must advocate its extension." the challenge, so
bluntly put, was as bluntly answered. "gentlemen of the south,"
responded a delegate from ohio, "you mistake us. you mistake us. we will
not do it."

for ten days the charleston convention wrangled over the platform and
balloted for the nomination of a candidate. douglas, though in the lead,
could not get the two-thirds vote required for victory. for more than
fifty times the roll of the convention was called without a decision.
then in sheer desperation the convention adjourned to meet later at
baltimore. when the delegates again assembled, their passions ran as
high as ever. the division into two irreconcilable factions was
unchanged. uncompromising delegates from the south withdrew to richmond,
nominated john c. breckinridge of kentucky for president, and put forth
a platform asserting the rights of slave owners in the territories and
the duty of the federal government to protect them. the delegates who
remained at baltimore nominated douglas and endorsed his doctrine of
squatter sovereignty.

=the constitutional union party.=--while the democratic party was being
disrupted, a fragment of the former whig party, known as the
constitutional unionists, held a convention at baltimore and selected
national candidates: john bell from tennessee and edward everett from
massachusetts. a melancholy interest attached to this assembly. it was
mainly composed of old men whose political views were those of clay and
webster, cherished leaders now dead and gone. in their platform they
sought to exorcise the evil spirit of partisanship by inviting their
fellow citizens to "support the constitution of the country, the union
of the states, and the enforcement of the laws." the party that
campaigned on this grand sentiment only drew laughter from the democrats
and derision from the republicans and polled less than one-fourth the
votes.

=the republican convention.=--with the whigs definitely forced into a
separate group, the republican convention at chicago was fated to be
sectional in character, although five slave states did send delegates.
as the democrats were split, the party that had led a forlorn hope four
years before was on the high road to success at last. new and powerful
recruits were found. the advocates of a high protective tariff and the
friends of free homesteads for farmers and workingmen mingled with
enthusiastic foes of slavery. while still firm in their opposition to
slavery in the territories, the republicans went on record in favor of a
homestead law granting free lands to settlers and approved customs
duties designed "to encourage the development of the industrial
interests of the whole country." the platform was greeted with cheers
which, according to the stenographic report of the convention, became
loud and prolonged as the protective tariff and homestead planks were
read.

having skillfully drawn a platform to unite the north in opposition to
slavery and the planting system, the republicans were also adroit in
their selection of a candidate. the tariff plank might carry
pennsylvania, a democratic state; but ohio, indiana, and illinois were
equally essential to success at the polls. the southern counties of
these states were filled with settlers from virginia, north carolina,
and kentucky who, even if they had no love for slavery, were no friends
of abolition. moreover, remembering the old fight on the united states
bank in andrew jackson's day, they were suspicious of men from the east.
accordingly, they did not favor the candidacy of seward, the leading
republican statesman and "favorite son" of new york.

after much trading and discussing, the convention came to the conclusion
that abraham lincoln of illinois was the most "available" candidate. he
was of southern origin, born in kentucky in 1809, a fact that told
heavily in the campaign in the ohio valley. he was a man of the soil,
the son of poor frontier parents, a pioneer who in his youth had labored
in the fields and forests, celebrated far and wide as "honest abe, the
rail-splitter." it was well-known that he disliked slavery, but was no
abolitionist. he had come dangerously near to seward's radicalism in his
"house-divided-against-itself" speech but he had never committed himself
to the reckless doctrine that there was a "higher law" than the
constitution. slavery in the south he tolerated as a bitter fact;
slavery in the territories he opposed with all his strength. of his
sincerity there could be no doubt. he was a speaker and writer of
singular power, commanding, by the use of simple and homely language,
the hearts and minds of those who heard him speak or read his printed
words. he had gone far enough in his opposition to slavery; but not too
far. he was the man of the hour! amid lusty cheers from ten thousand
throats, lincoln was nominated for the presidency by the republicans. in
the ensuing election, he carried all the free states except new jersey.

chapter xv

the civil war and reconstruction


"the irrepressible conflict is about to be visited upon us through the
black republican nominee and his fanatical, diabolical republican
party," ran an appeal to the voters of south carolina during the
campaign of 1860. if that calamity comes to pass, responded the governor
of the state, the answer should be a declaration of independence. in a
few days the suspense was over. the news of lincoln's election came
speeding along the wires. prepared for the event, the editor of the
charleston _mercury_ unfurled the flag of his state amid wild cheers
from an excited throng in the streets. then he seized his pen and wrote:
"the tea has been thrown overboard; the revolution of 1860 has been
initiated." the issue was submitted to the voters in the choice of
delegates to a state convention called to cast off the yoke of the
constitution.


the southern confederacy

=secession.=--as arranged, the convention of south carolina assembled in
december and without a dissenting voice passed the ordinance of
secession withdrawing from the union. bells were rung exultantly, the
roar of cannon carried the news to outlying counties, fireworks lighted
up the heavens, and champagne flowed. the crisis so long expected had
come at last; even the conservatives who had prayed that they might
escape the dreadful crash greeted it with a sigh of relief.

[illustration: the united states in 1861

the border states (in purple) remained loyal.]

south carolina now sent forth an appeal to her sister states--states
that had in jackson's day repudiated nullification as leading to "the
dissolution of the union." the answer that came this time was in a
different vein. a month had hardly elapsed before five other
states--florida, georgia, alabama, mississippi, and louisiana--had
withdrawn from the union. in february, texas followed. virginia,
hesitating until the bombardment of fort sumter forced a conclusion,
seceded in april; but fifty-five of the one hundred and forty-three
delegates dissented, foreshadowing the creation of the new state of west
virginia which congress admitted to the union in 1863. in may, north
carolina, arkansas, and tennessee announced their independence.

=secession and the theories of the union.=--in severing their relations
with the union, the seceding states denied every point in the northern
theory of the constitution. that theory, as every one knows, was
carefully formulated by webster and elaborated by lincoln. according to
it, the union was older than the states; it was created before the
declaration of independence for the purpose of common defense. the
articles of confederation did but strengthen this national bond and the
constitution sealed it forever. the federal government was not a
creature of state governments. it was erected by the people and derived
its powers directly from them. "it is," said webster, "the people's
constitution, the people's government; made for the people; made by the
people; and answerable to the people. the people of the united states
have declared that this constitution shall be the supreme law." when a
state questions the lawfulness of any act of the federal government, it
cannot nullify that act or withdraw from the union; it must abide by the
decision of the supreme court of the united states. the union of these
states is perpetual, ran lincoln's simple argument in the first
inaugural; the federal constitution has no provision for its own
termination; it can be destroyed only by some action not provided for in
the instrument itself; even if it is a compact among all the states the
consent of all must be necessary to its dissolution; therefore no state
can lawfully get out of the union and acts of violence against the
united states are insurrectionary or revolutionary. this was the system
which he believed himself bound to defend by his oath of office
"registered in heaven."

all this reasoning southern statesmen utterly rejected. in their opinion
the thirteen original states won their independence as separate and
sovereign powers. the treaty of peace with great britain named them all
and acknowledged them "to be free, sovereign, and independent states."
the articles of confederation very explicitly declared that "each state
retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence." the constitution
was a "league of nations" formed by an alliance of thirteen separate
powers, each one of which ratified the instrument before it was put into
effect. they voluntarily entered the union under the constitution and
voluntarily they could leave it. such was the constitutional doctrine of
hayne, calhoun, and jefferson davis. in seceding, the southern states
had only to follow legal methods, and the transaction would be correct
in every particular. so conventions were summoned, elections were held,
and "sovereign assemblies of the people" set aside the constitution in
the same manner as it had been ratified nearly four score years before.
thus, said the southern people, the moral judgment was fulfilled and the
letter of the law carried into effect.

[illustration: jefferson davis]

=the formation of the confederacy.=--acting on the call of mississippi,
a congress of delegates from the seceded states met at montgomery,
alabama, and on february 8, 1861, adopted a temporary plan of union. it
selected, as provisional president, jefferson davis of mississippi, a
man well fitted by experience and moderation for leadership, a graduate
of west point, who had rendered distinguished service on the field of
battle in the mexican war, in public office, and as a member of
congress.

in march, a permanent constitution of the confederate states was
drafted. it was quickly ratified by the states; elections were held in
november; and the government under it went into effect the next year.
this new constitution, in form, was very much like the famous instrument
drafted at philadelphia in 1787. it provided for a president, a senate,
and a house of representatives along almost identical lines. in the
powers conferred upon them, however, there were striking differences.
the right to appropriate money for internal improvements was expressly
withheld; bounties were not to be granted from the treasury nor import
duties so laid as to promote or foster any branch of industry. the
dignity of the state, if any might be bold enough to question it, was
safeguarded in the opening line by the declaration that each acted "in
its sovereign and independent character" in forming the southern union.

=financing the confederacy.=--no government ever set out upon its career
with more perplexing tasks in front of it. the north had a monetary
system; the south had to create one. the north had a scheme of taxation
that produced large revenues from numerous sources; the south had to
formulate and carry out a financial plan. like the north, the
confederacy expected to secure a large revenue from customs duties,
easily collected and little felt among the masses. to this expectation
the blockade of southern ports inaugurated by lincoln in april, 1861,
soon put an end. following the precedent set by congress under the
articles of confederation, the southern congress resorted to a direct
property tax apportioned among the states, only to meet the failure that
might have been foretold.

the confederacy also sold bonds, the first issue bringing into the
treasury nearly all the specie available in the southern banks. this
specie by unhappy management was early sent abroad to pay for supplies,
sapping the foundations of a sound currency system. large amounts of
bonds were sold overseas, commanding at first better terms than those
of the north in the markets of london, paris, and amsterdam, many an
english lord and statesman buying with enthusiasm and confidence to
lament within a few years the proofs of his folly. the difficulties of
bringing through the blockade any supplies purchased by foreign bond
issues, however, nullified the effect of foreign credit and forced the
confederacy back upon the device of paper money. in all approximately
one billion dollars streamed from the printing presses, to fall in value
at an alarming rate, reaching in january, 1863, the astounding figure of
fifty dollars in paper money for one in gold. every known device was
used to prevent its depreciation, without result. to the issues of the
confederate congress were added untold millions poured out by the states
and by private banks.

=human and material resources.=--when we measure strength for strength
in those signs of power--men, money, and supplies--it is difficult to
see how the south was able to embark on secession and war with such
confidence in the outcome. in the confederacy at the final reckoning
there were eleven states in all, to be pitted against twenty-two; a
population of nine millions, nearly one-half servile, to be pitted
against twenty-two millions; a land without great industries to produce
war supplies and without vast capital to furnish war finances, joined in
battle with a nation already industrial and fortified by property worth
eleven billion dollars. even after the confederate congress authorized
conscription in 1862, southern man power, measured in numbers, was
wholly inadequate to uphold the independence which had been declared.
how, therefore, could the confederacy hope to sustain itself against

such a combination of men, money, and materials as the north could
marshal?

=southern expectations.=--the answer to this question is to be found in
the ideas that prevailed among southern leaders. first of all, they
hoped, in vain, to carry the confederacy up to the ohio river; and, with
the aid of missouri, to gain possession of the mississippi valley, the
granary of the nation. in the second place, they reckoned upon a large
and continuous trade with great britain--the exchange of cotton for war
materials. they likewise expected to receive recognition and open aid
from european powers that looked with satisfaction upon the breakup of
the great american republic. in the third place, they believed that
their control over several staples so essential to northern industry
would enable them to bring on an industrial crisis in the manufacturing
states. "i firmly believe," wrote senator hammond, of south carolina, in
1860, "that the slave-holding south is now the controlling power of the
world; that no other power would face us in hostility. cotton, rice,
tobacco, and naval stores command the world; and we have the sense to
know it and are sufficiently teutonic to carry it out successfully. the
north without us would be a motherless calf, bleating about, and die of
mange and starvation."

there were other grounds for confidence. having seized all of the
federal military and naval supplies in the south, and having left the
national government weak in armed power during their possession of the
presidency, southern leaders looked to a swift war, if it came at all,
to put the finishing stroke to independence. "the greasy mechanics of
the north," it was repeatedly said, "will not fight." as to disparity in
numbers they drew historic parallels. "our fathers, a mere handful,
overcame the enormous power of great britain," a saying of ex-president
tyler, ran current to reassure the doubtful. finally, and this point
cannot be too strongly emphasized, the south expected to see a weakened
and divided north. it knew that the abolitionists and the southern
sympathizers were ready to let the confederate states go in peace; that
lincoln represented only a little more than one-third the voters of the
country; and that the vote for douglas, bell, and breckinridge meant a
decided opposition to the republicans and their policies.

=efforts at compromise.=--republican leaders, on reviewing the same
facts, were themselves uncertain as to the outcome of a civil war and
made many efforts to avoid a crisis. thurlow weed, an albany journalist
and politician who had done much to carry new york for lincoln, proposed
a plan for extending the missouri compromise line to the pacific.
jefferson davis, warning his followers that a war if it came would be
terrible, was prepared to accept the offer; but lincoln, remembering his
campaign pledges, stood firm as a rock against it. his followers in
congress took the same position with regard to a similar settlement
suggested by senator crittenden of kentucky.

though unwilling to surrender his solemn promises respecting slavery in
the territories, lincoln was prepared to give to southern leaders a
strong guarantee that his administration would not interfere directly or
indirectly with slavery in the states. anxious to reassure the south on
this point, the republicans in congress proposed to write into the
constitution a declaration that no amendment should ever be made
authorizing the abolition of or interference with slavery in any state.
the resolution, duly passed, was sent forth on march 4, 1861, with the
approval of lincoln; it was actually ratified by three states before the
storm of war destroyed it. by the irony of fate the thirteenth amendment
was to abolish, not guarantee, slavery.


the war measures of the federal government

=raising the armies.=--the crisis at fort sumter, on april 12-14, 1861,
forced the president and congress to turn from negotiations to problems
of warfare. little did they realize the magnitude of the task before
them. lincoln's first call for volunteers, issued on april 15, 1861,
limited the number to 75,000, put their term of service at three months,
and prescribed their duty as the enforcement of the law against
combinations too powerful to be overcome by ordinary judicial process.
disillusionment swiftly followed. the terrible defeat of the federals at
bull run on july 21 revealed the serious character of the task before
them; and by a series of measures congress put the entire man power of
the country at the president's command. under these acts, he issued new
calls for volunteers. early in august, 1862, he ordered a draft of
militiamen numbering 300,000 for nine months' service. the results were
disappointing--ominous--for only about 87,000 soldiers were added to the
army. something more drastic was clearly necessary.

in march, 1863, lincoln signed the inevitable draft law; it enrolled in
the national forces liable to military duty all able-bodied male
citizens and persons of foreign birth who had declared their intention
to become citizens, between the ages of twenty and forty-five
years--with exemptions on grounds of physical weakness and dependency.
from the men enrolled were drawn by lot those destined to active
service. unhappily the measure struck a mortal blow at the principle of
universal liability by excusing any person who found a substitute for
himself or paid into the war office a sum, not exceeding three hundred
dollars, to be fixed by general order. this provision, so crass and so
obviously favoring the well-to-do, sowed seeds of bitterness which
sprang up a hundredfold in the north.

[illustration: the draft riots in new york city]

the beginning of the drawings under the draft act in new york city, on
monday, july 13, 1863, was the signal for four days of rioting. in the
course of this uprising, draft headquarters were destroyed; the office
of the _tribune_ was gutted; negroes were seized, hanged, and shot; the
homes of obnoxious unionists were burned down; the residence of the
mayor of the city was attacked; and regular battles were fought in the
streets between the rioters and the police. business stopped and a large
part of the city passed absolutely into the control of the mob. not
until late the following wednesday did enough troops arrive to restore
order and enable the residents of the city to resume their daily
activities. at least a thousand people had been killed or wounded and
more than a million dollars' worth of damage done to property. the draft
temporarily interrupted by this outbreak was then resumed and carried
out without further trouble.

the results of the draft were in the end distinctly disappointing to the
government. the exemptions were numerous and the number who preferred
and were able to pay $300 rather than serve exceeded all expectations.
volunteering, it is true, was stimulated, but even that resource could
hardly keep the thinning ranks of the army filled. with reluctance
congress struck out the $300 exemption clause, but still favored the
well-to-do by allowing them to hire substitutes if they could find them.
with all this power in its hands the administration was able by january,
1865, to construct a union army that outnumbered the confederates two to
one.

=war finance.=--in the financial sphere the north faced immense
difficulties. the surplus in the treasury had been dissipated by 1861
and the tariff of 1857 had failed to produce an income sufficient to
meet the ordinary expenses of the government. confronted by military and
naval expenditures of appalling magnitude, rising from $35,000,000 in
the first year of the war to $1,153,000,000 in the last year, the
administration had to tap every available source of income. the duties
on imports were increased, not once but many times, producing huge
revenues and also meeting the most extravagant demands of the
manufacturers for protection. direct taxes were imposed on the states
according to their respective populations, but the returns were
meager--all out of proportion to the irritation involved. stamp taxes
and taxes on luxuries, occupations, and the earnings of corporations
were laid with a weight that, in ordinary times, would have drawn forth
opposition of ominous strength. the whole gamut of taxation was run.
even a tax on incomes and gains by the year, the first in the history of
the federal government, was included in the long list.

revenues were supplemented by bond issues, mounting in size and interest
rate, until in october, at the end of the war, the debt stood at
$2,208,000,000. the total cost of the war was many times the money value
of all the slaves in the southern states. to the debt must be added
nearly half a billion dollars in "greenbacks"--paper money issued by
congress in desperation as bond sales and revenues from taxes failed to
meet the rising expenditures. this currency issued at par on
questionable warrant from the constitution, like all such paper, quickly
began to decline until in the worst fortunes of 1864 one dollar in gold
was worth nearly three in greenbacks.

=the blockade of southern ports.=--four days after his call for
volunteers, april 19, 1861, president lincoln issued a proclamation
blockading the ports of the southern confederacy. later the blockade was
extended to virginia and north carolina, as they withdrew from the
union. vessels attempting to enter or leave these ports, if they
disregarded the warnings of a blockading ship, were to be captured and
brought as prizes to the nearest convenient port. to make the order
effective, immediate steps were taken to increase the naval forces,
depleted by neglect, until the entire coast line was patrolled with such
a number of ships that it was a rare captain who ventured to run the
gantlet. the collision between the _merrimac_ and the _monitor_ in
march, 1862, sealed the fate of the confederacy. the exploits of the
union navy are recorded in the falling export of cotton: $202,000,000 in
1860; $42,000,000 in 1861; and $4,000,000 in 1862.

the deadly effect of this paralysis of trade upon southern war power may
be readily imagined. foreign loans, payable in cotton, could be
negotiated but not paid off. supplies could be purchased on credit but
not brought through the drag net. with extreme difficulty could the
confederate government secure even paper for the issue of money and
bonds. publishers, in despair at the loss of supplies, were finally
driven to the use of brown wrapping paper and wall paper. as the
railways and rolling stock wore out, it became impossible to renew them
from england or france. unable to export their cotton, planters on the
seaboard burned it in what were called "fires of patriotism." in their
lurid light the fatal weakness of southern economy stood revealed.

[illustration: a blockade runner]

=diplomacy.=--the war had not advanced far before the federal government
became involved in many perplexing problems of diplomacy in europe. the
confederacy early turned to england and france for financial aid and for
recognition as an independent power. davis believed that the industrial
crisis created by the cotton blockade would in time literally compel
europe to intervene in order to get this essential staple. the crisis
came as he expected but not the result. thousands of english textile
workers were thrown out of employment; and yet, while on the point of
starvation, they adopted resolutions favoring the north instead of
petitioning their government to aid the south by breaking the blockade.

with the ruling classes it was far otherwise. napoleon iii, the emperor
of the french, was eager to help in disrupting the american republic; if
he could have won england's support, he would have carried out his
designs. as it turned out he found plenty of sympathy across the channel
but not open and official cooperation. according to the eminent
historian, rhodes, "four-fifths of the british house of lords and most
members of the house of commons were favorable to the confederacy and
anxious for its triumph." late in 1862 the british ministers, thus
sustained, were on the point of recognizing the independence of the
confederacy. had it not been for their extreme caution, for the constant
and harassing criticism by english friends of the united states--like
john bright--and for the victories of vicksburg and gettysburg, both

england and france would have doubtless declared the confederacy to be
one of the independent powers of the earth.

[illustration: john bright]

while stopping short of recognizing its independence, england and france
took several steps that were in favor of the south. in proclaiming
neutrality, they early accepted the confederates as "belligerents" and
accorded them the rights of people at war--a measure which aroused anger
in the north at first but was later admitted to be sound. otherwise
confederates taken in battle would have been regarded as "rebels" or
"traitors" to be hanged or shot. napoleon iii proposed to russia in 1861
a coalition of powers against the north, only to meet a firm refusal.
the next year he suggested intervention to great britain, encountering
this time a conditional rejection of his plans. in 1863, not daunted by
rebuffs, he offered his services to lincoln as a mediator, receiving in
reply a polite letter declining his proposal and a sharp resolution from
congress suggesting that he attend to his own affairs.

in both england and france the governments pursued a policy of
friendliness to the confederate agents. the british ministry, with
indifference if not connivance, permitted rams and ships to be built in
british docks and allowed them to escape to play havoc under the
confederate flag with american commerce. one of them, the _alabama_,
built in liverpool by a british firm and paid for by bonds sold in
england, ran an extraordinary career and threatened to break the
blockade. the course followed by the british government, against the
protests of the american minister in london, was later regretted. by an
award of a tribunal of arbitration at geneva in 1872, great britain was
required to pay the huge sum of $15,500,000 to cover the damages wrought
by confederate cruisers fitted out in england.

[illustration: william h. seward]

in all fairness it should be said that the conduct of the north
contributed to the irritation between the two countries. seward, the
secretary of state, was vindictive in dealing with great britain; had it
not been for the moderation of lincoln, he would have pursued a course
verging in the direction of open war. the new york and boston papers
were severe in their attacks on england. words were, on one occasion at
least, accompanied by an act savoring of open hostility. in november,
1861, captain wilkes, commanding a union vessel, overhauled the british
steamer _trent_, and carried off by force two confederate agents, mason
and slidell, sent by president davis to represent the confederacy at
london and paris respectively. this was a clear violation of the right
of merchant vessels to be immune from search and impressment; and, in
answer to the demand of great britain for the release of the two men,
the united states conceded that it was in the wrong. it surrendered the
two confederate agents to a british vessel for safe conduct abroad, and
made appropriate apologies.

=emancipation.=--among the extreme war measures adopted by the northern
government must be counted the emancipation of the slaves in the states
in arms against the union. this step was early and repeatedly suggested
to lincoln by the abolitionists; but was steadily put aside. he knew
that the abolitionists were a mere handful, that emancipation might
drive the border states into secession, and that the northern soldiers
had enlisted to save the union. moreover, he had before him a solemn
resolution passed by congress on july 22, 1861, declaring the sole
purpose of the war to be the salvation of the union and disavowing any
intention of interfering with slavery.

the federal government, though pledged to the preservation of slavery,
soon found itself beaten back upon its course and out upon a new tack.
before a year had elapsed, namely on april 10, 1862, congress resolved
that financial aid should be given to any state that might adopt gradual
emancipation. six days later it abolished slavery in the district of
columbia. two short months elapsed. on june 19, 1862, it swept slavery
forever from the territories of the united states. chief justice taney
still lived, the dred scott decision stood as written in the book, but
the constitution had been re-read in the light of the civil war. the
drift of public sentiment in the north was being revealed.

while these measures were pending in congress, lincoln was slowly making
up his mind. by july of that year he had come to his great decision.
near the end of that month he read to his cabinet the draft of a
proclamation of emancipation; but he laid it aside until a military
achievement would make it something more than an idle gesture. in
september, the severe check administered to lee at antietam seemed to
offer the golden opportunity. on the 22d, the immortal document was
given to the world announcing that, unless the states in arms returned
to the union by january 1, 1863, the fatal blow at their "peculiar
institution" would be delivered. southern leaders treated it with slight
regard, and so on the date set the promise was fulfilled. the
proclamation was issued as a war measure, adopted by the president as
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, on grounds of military
necessity. it did not abolish slavery. it simply emancipated slaves in
places then in arms against federal authority. everywhere else slavery,
as far as the proclamation was concerned, remained lawful.

[illustration: abraham lincoln]

to seal forever the proclamation of emancipation, and to extend freedom
to the whole country, congress, in january, 1865, on the urgent
recommendation of lincoln, transmitted to the states the thirteenth
amendment, abolishing slavery throughout the united states. by the end
of 1865 the amendment was ratified. the house was not divided against
itself; it did not fall; it was all free.

=the restraint of civil liberty.=--as in all great wars, particularly
those in the nature of a civil strife, it was found necessary to use
strong measures to sustain opinion favorable to the administration's
military policies and to frustrate the designs of those who sought to
hamper its action. within two weeks of his first call for volunteers,
lincoln empowered general scott to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_
along the line of march between philadelphia and washington and thus to
arrest and hold without interference from civil courts any one whom he
deemed a menace to the union. at a later date the area thus ruled by
military officers was extended by executive proclamation. by an act of
march 3, 1863, congress, desiring to lay all doubts about the
president's power, authorized him to suspend the writ throughout the
united states or in any part thereof. it also freed military officers
from the necessity of surrendering to civil courts persons arrested
under their orders, or even making answers to writs issued from such
courts. in the autumn of that year the president, acting under the terms
of this law, declared this ancient and honorable instrument for the
protection of civil liberties, the _habeas corpus_, suspended throughout
the length and breadth of the land. the power of the government was also
strengthened by an act defining and punishing certain conspiracies,
passed on july 31, 1861--a measure which imposed heavy penalties on
those who by force, intimidation, or threat interfered with the
execution of the law.

thus doubly armed, the military authorities spared no one suspected of
active sympathy with the southern cause. editors were arrested and
imprisoned, their papers suspended, and their newsboys locked up. those
who organized "peace meetings" soon found themselves in the toils of the
law. members of the maryland legislature, the mayor of baltimore, and
local editors suspected of entertaining secessionist opinions, were
imprisoned on military orders although charged with no offense, and were
denied the privilege of examination before a civil magistrate. a vermont
farmer, too outspoken in his criticism of the government, found himself
behind the bars until the government, in its good pleasure, saw fit to
release him. these measures were not confined to the theater of war nor
to the border states where the spirit of secession was strong enough to
endanger the cause of union. they were applied all through the northern
states up to the very boundaries of canada. zeal for the national cause,
too often supplemented by a zeal for persecution, spread terror among
those who wavered in the singleness of their devotion to the union.

these drastic operations on the part of military authorities, so foreign
to the normal course of civilized life, naturally aroused intense and
bitter hostility. meetings of protest were held throughout the country.
thirty-six members of the house of representatives sought to put on
record their condemnation of the suspension of the _habeas corpus_ act,
only to meet a firm denial by the supporters of the act. chief justice
taney, before whom the case of a man arrested under the president's
military authority was brought, emphatically declared, in a long and
learned opinion bristling with historical examples, that the president
had no power to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_. in congress and
out, democrats, abolitionists, and champions of civil liberty denounced
lincoln and his cabinet in unsparing terms. vallandigham, a democratic
leader of ohio, afterward banished to the south for his opposition to
the war, constantly applied to lincoln the epithet of "caesar." wendell
phillips saw in him "a more unlimited despot than the world knows this
side of china."

sensitive to such stinging thrusts and no friend of wanton persecution,
lincoln attempted to mitigate the rigors of the law by paroling many
political prisoners. the general policy, however, he defended in homely
language, very different in tone and meaning from the involved reasoning
of the lawyers. "must i shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts,
while i must not touch a hair of the wily agitator who induces him to
desert?" he asked in a quiet way of some spokesmen for those who
protested against arresting people for "talking against the war." this
summed up his philosophy. he was engaged in a war to save the union, and
all measures necessary and proper to accomplish that purpose were
warranted by the constitution which he had sworn to uphold.

=military strategy--north and south.=--the broad outlines of military
strategy followed by the commanders of the opposing forces are clear
even to the layman who cannot be expected to master the details of a
campaign or, for that matter, the maneuvers of a single great battle.
the problem for the south was one of defense mainly, though even for
defense swift and paralyzing strokes at the north were later deemed
imperative measures. the problem of the north was, to put it baldly, one
of invasion and conquest. southern territory had to be invaded and
southern armies beaten on their own ground or worn down to exhaustion
there.

in the execution of this undertaking, geography, as usual, played a
significant part in the disposition of forces. the appalachian ranges,
stretching through the confederacy to northern alabama, divided the
campaigns into eastern and western enterprises. both were of signal
importance. victory in the east promised the capture of the confederate
capital of richmond, a stroke of moral worth, hardly to be
overestimated. victory in the west meant severing the confederacy and
opening the mississippi valley down to the gulf.

as it turned out, the western forces accomplished their task first,
vindicating the military powers of union soldiers and shaking the
confidence of opposing commanders. in february, 1862, grant captured
fort donelson on the tennessee river, rallied wavering unionists in
kentucky, forced the evacuation of nashville, and opened the way for two
hundred miles into the confederacy. at shiloh, murfreesboro, vicksburg,
chickamauga, chattanooga, desperate fighting followed and, in spite of
varying fortunes, it resulted in the discomfiture and retirement of
confederate forces to the southeast into georgia. by the middle of 1863,
the mississippi valley was open to the gulf, the initiative taken out of
the hands of southern commanders in the west, and the way prepared for
sherman's final stroke--the march from atlanta to the sea--a maneuver
executed with needless severity in the autumn of 1864.

for the almost unbroken succession of achievements in the west by
generals grant, sherman, thomas, and hooker against albert sidney
johnston, bragg, pemberton, and hood, the union forces in the east
offered at first an almost equally unbroken series of misfortunes and
disasters. far from capturing richmond, they had been thrown on the
defensive. general after general--mcclellan, pope, burnside, hooker, and
meade--was tried and found wanting. none of them could administer a
crushing defeat to the confederate troops and more than once the union
soldiers were beaten in a fair battle. they did succeed, however, in
delivering a severe check to advancing confederates under general robert
e. lee, first at antietam in september, 1862, and then at gettysburg in
july, 1863--checks reckoned as victories though in each instance the
confederates escaped without demoralization. not until the beginning of
the next year, when general grant, supplied with almost unlimited men
and munitions, began his irresistible hammering at lee's army, did the
final phase of the war commence. the pitiless drive told at last.
general lee, on april 9, 1865, seeing the futility of further conflict,
surrendered an army still capable of hard fighting, at appomattox, not
far from the capital of the confederacy.

=abraham lincoln.=--the services of lincoln to the cause of union defy
description. a judicial scrutiny of the war reveals his thought and
planning in every part of the varied activity that finally crowned
northern arms with victory. is it in the field of diplomacy? does
seward, the secretary of state, propose harsh and caustic measures
likely to draw england's sword into the scale? lincoln counsels
moderation. he takes the irritating message and with his own hand
strikes out, erases, tones down, and interlines, exchanging for words
that sting and burn the language of prudence and caution. is it a matter
of compromise with the south, so often proposed by men on both sides
sick of carnage? lincoln is always ready to listen and turns away only
when he is invited to surrender principles essential to the safety of
the union. is it high strategy of war, a question of the general best
fitted to win gettysburg--hooker, sedgwick, or meade? lincoln goes in
person to the war department in the dead of night to take counsel with
his secretary and to make the fateful choice.

is it a complaint from a citizen, deprived, as he believes, of his civil
liberties unjustly or in violation of the constitution? lincoln is ready
to hear it and anxious to afford relief, if warrant can be found for it.
is a mother begging for the life of a son sentenced to be shot as a
deserter? lincoln hears her petition, and grants it even against the
protests made by his generals in the name of military discipline. do
politicians sow dissensions in the army and among civilians? lincoln
grandly waves aside their petty personalities and invites them to think
of the greater cause. is it a question of securing votes to ratify the
thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery? lincoln thinks it not beneath
his dignity to traffic and huckster with politicians over the trifling
jobs asked in return by the members who hold out against him. does a new
york newspaper call him an ignorant western boor? lincoln's reply is a
letter to a mother who has given her all--her sons on the field of
battle--and an address at gettysburg, both of which will live as long as
the tongue in which they were written. these are tributes not only to
his mastery of the english language but also to his mastery of all those
sentiments of sweetness and strength which are the finest flowers of
culture.

throughout the entire span of service, however, lincoln was beset by
merciless critics. the fiery apostles of abolition accused him of
cowardice when he delayed the bold stroke at slavery. anti-war democrats
lashed out at every step he took. even in his own party he found no
peace. charles sumner complained: "our president is now dictator,
_imperator_--whichever you like; but how vain to have the power of a
god and not to use it godlike." leaders among the republicans sought to
put him aside in 1864 and place chase in his chair. "i hope we may never
have a worse man," was lincoln's quiet answer.

wide were the dissensions in the north during that year and the
republicans, while selecting lincoln as their candidate again, cast off
their old name and chose the simple title of the "union party."
moreover, they selected a southern man, andrew johnson, of tennessee, to
be associated with him as candidate for vice president. this combination
the northern democrats boldly confronted with a platform declaring that
"after four years of failure to restore the union by the experiment of
war, during which, under the pretence of military necessity or war power
higher than the constitution, the constitution itself has been
disregarded in every part and public liberty and private right alike
trodden down ... justice, humanity, liberty, and public welfare demand
that immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities, to the
end that peace may be restored on the basis of the federal union of the
states." it is true that the democratic candidate, general mcclellan,
sought to break the yoke imposed upon him by the platform, saying that
he could not look his old comrades in the face and pronounce their
efforts vain; but the party call to the nation to repudiate lincoln and
his works had gone forth. the response came, giving lincoln 2,200,000
votes against 1,800,000 for his opponent. the bitter things said about
him during the campaign, he forgot and forgave. when in april, 1865, he
was struck down by the assassin's hand, he above all others in
washington was planning measures of moderation and healing.


the results of the civil war

there is a strong and natural tendency on the part of writers to stress
the dramatic and heroic aspects of war; but the long judgment of history
requires us to include all other significant phases as well. like every
great armed conflict, the civil war outran the purposes of those who
took part in it. waged over the nature of the union, it made a
revolution in the union, changing public policies and constitutional
principles and giving a new direction to agriculture and industry.

=the supremacy of the union.=--first and foremost, the war settled for
all time the long dispute as to the nature of the federal system. the
doctrine of state sovereignty was laid to rest. men might still speak of
the rights of states and think of their commonwealths with affection,
but nullification and secession were destroyed. the nation was supreme.

=the destruction of the slave power.=--next to the vindication of
national supremacy was the destruction of the planting aristocracy of
the south--that great power which had furnished leadership of undoubted
ability and had so long contested with the industrial and commercial
interests of the north. the first paralyzing blow at the planters was
struck by the abolition of slavery. the second and third came with the
fourteenth (1868) and fifteenth (1870) amendments, giving the ballot to
freedmen and excluding from public office the confederate
leaders--driving from the work of reconstruction the finest talents of
the south. as if to add bitterness to gall and wormwood, the fourteenth
amendment forbade the united states or any state to pay any debts
incurred in aid of the confederacy or in the emancipation of the
slaves--plunging into utter bankruptcy the southern financiers who had
stripped their section of capital to support their cause. so the
southern planters found themselves excluded from public office and ruled
over by their former bondmen under the tutelage of republican leaders.
their labor system was wrecked and their money and bonds were as
worthless as waste paper. the south was subject to the north. that which
neither the federalists nor the whigs had been able to accomplish in the
realm of statecraft was accomplished on the field of battle.


=the triumph of industry.=--the wreck of the planting system was
accompanied by a mighty upswing of northern industry which made the old
whigs of massachusetts and pennsylvania stare in wonderment. the demands
of the federal government for manufactured goods at unrestricted prices
gave a stimulus to business which more than replaced the lost markets of
the south. between 1860 and 1870 the number of manufacturing
establishments increased 79.6 per cent as against 14.2 for the previous
decade; while the number of persons employed almost doubled. there was
no doubt about the future of american industry.

=the victory for the protective tariff.=--moreover, it was henceforth to
be well protected. for many years before the war the friends of
protection had been on the defensive. the tariff act of 1857 imposed
duties so low as to presage a tariff for revenue only. the war changed
all that. the extraordinary military expenditures, requiring heavy taxes
on all sources, justified tariffs so high that a follower of clay or
webster might well have gasped with astonishment. after the war was over
the debt remained and both interest and principal had to be paid.
protective arguments based on economic reasoning were supported by a
plain necessity for revenue which admitted no dispute.

=a liberal immigration policy.=--linked with industry was the labor
supply. the problem of manning industries became a pressing matter, and
republican leaders grappled with it. in the platform of the union party
adopted in 1864 it was declared "that foreign immigration, which in the
past has added so much to the wealth, the development of resources, and
the increase of power to this nation--the asylum of the oppressed of all
nations--should be fostered and encouraged by a liberal and just
policy." in that very year congress, recognizing the importance of the
problem, passed a measure of high significance, creating a bureau of
immigration, and authorizing a modified form of indentured labor, by
making it legal for immigrants to pledge their wages in advance to pay
their passage over. though the bill was soon repealed, the practice
authorized by it was long continued. the cheapness of the passage
shortened the term of service; but the principle was older than the
days of william penn.

=the homestead act of 1862.=--in the immigration measure guaranteeing a
continuous and adequate labor supply, the manufacturers saw an offset to
the homestead act of 1862 granting free lands to settlers. the homestead
law they had resisted in a long and bitter congressional battle.
naturally, they had not taken kindly to a scheme which lured men away
from the factories or enabled them to make unlimited demands for higher
wages as the price of remaining. southern planters likewise had feared
free homesteads for the very good reason that they only promised to add
to the overbalancing power of the north.

in spite of the opposition, supporters of a liberal land policy made
steady gains. free-soil democrats,--jacksonian farmers and
mechanics,--labor reformers, and political leaders, like stephen a.
douglas of illinois and andrew johnson of tennessee, kept up the
agitation in season and out. more than once were they able to force a
homestead bill through the house of representatives only to have it
blocked in the senate where southern interests were intrenched. then,
after the senate was won over, a democratic president, james buchanan,
vetoed the bill. still the issue lived. the republicans, strong among
the farmers of the northwest, favored it from the beginning and pressed
it upon the attention of the country. finally the manufacturers yielded;
they received their compensation in the contract labor law. in 1862
congress provided for the free distribution of land in 160-acre lots
among men and women of strong arms and willing hearts ready to build
their serried lines of homesteads to the rockies and beyond.

=internal improvements.=--if farmers and manufacturers were early
divided on the matter of free homesteads, the same could hardly be said
of internal improvements. the western tiller of the soil was as eager
for some easy way of sending his produce to market as the manufacturer
was for the same means to transport his goods to the consumer on the
farm. while the confederate leaders were writing into their
constitution a clause forbidding all appropriations for internal
improvements, the republican leaders at washington were planning such
expenditures from the treasury in the form of public land grants to
railways as would have dazed the authors of the national road bill half
a century earlier.

=sound finance--national banking.=--from hamilton's day to lincoln's,
business men in the east had contended for a sound system of national
currency. the experience of the states with paper money, painfully
impressive in the years before the framing of the constitution, had been
convincing to those who understood the economy of business. the
constitution, as we have seen, bore the signs of this experience. states
were forbidden to emit bills of credit: paper money, in short. this
provision stood clear in the document; but judicial ingenuity had
circumvented it in the age of jacksonian democracy. the states had
enacted and the supreme court, after the death of john marshall, had
sustained laws chartering banking companies and authorizing them to
issue paper money. so the country was beset by the old curse, the banks
of western and southern states issuing reams of paper notes to help
borrowers pay their debts.

in dealing with war finances, the republicans attacked this ancient
evil. by act of congress in 1864, they authorized a series of national
banks founded on the credit of government bonds and empowered to issue
notes. the next year they stopped all bank paper sent forth under the
authority of the states by means of a prohibitive tax. in this way, by
two measures congress restored federal control over the monetary system
although it did not reestablish the united states bank so hated by
jacksonian democracy.

=destruction of states' rights by fourteenth amendment.=--these acts and
others not cited here were measures of centralization and consolidation
at the expense of the powers and dignity of the states. they were all of
high import, but the crowning act of nationalism was the fourteenth
amendment which, among other things, forbade states to "deprive any
person of life, liberty or property without due process of law." the
immediate occasion, though not the actual cause of this provision, was
the need for protecting the rights of freedmen against hostile
legislatures in the south. the result of the amendment, as was
prophesied in protests loud and long from every quarter of the
democratic party, was the subjection of every act of state, municipal,
and county authorities to possible annulment by the supreme court at
washington. the expected happened.

few negroes ever brought cases under the fourteenth amendment to the
attention of the courts; but thousands of state laws, municipal
ordinances, and acts of local authorities were set aside as null and
void under it. laws of states regulating railway rates, fixing hours of
labor in bakeshops, and taxing corporations were in due time to be
annulled as conflicting with an amendment erroneously supposed to be
designed solely for the protection of negroes. as centralized power over
tariffs, railways, public lands, and other national concerns went to
congress, so centralized power over the acts of state and local
authorities involving an infringement of personal and property rights
was conferred on the federal judiciary, the apex of which was the
supreme court at washington. thus the old federation of "independent
states," all equal in rights and dignity, each wearing the "jewel of
sovereignty" so celebrated in southern oratory, had gone the way of all
flesh under the withering blasts of civil war.


reconstruction in the south

=theories about the position of the seceded states.=--on the morning of
april 9, 1865, when general lee surrendered his army to general grant,
eleven states stood in a peculiar relation to the union now declared
perpetual. lawyers and political philosophers were much perturbed and
had been for some time as to what should be done with the members of the
former confederacy. radical republicans held that they were "conquered
provinces" at the mercy of congress, to be governed under such laws as
it saw fit to enact and until in its wisdom it decided to readmit any or
all of them to the union. men of more conservative views held that, as
the war had been waged by the north on the theory that no state could
secede from the union, the confederate states had merely attempted to
withdraw and had failed. the corollary of this latter line of argument
was simple: "the southern states are still in the union and it is the
duty of the president, as commander-in-chief, to remove the federal
troops as soon as order is restored and the state governments ready to
function once more as usual."

=lincoln's proposal.=--some such simple and conservative form of
reconstruction had been suggested by lincoln in a proclamation of
december 8, 1863. he proposed pardon and a restoration of property,
except in slaves, to nearly all who had "directly or by implication
participated in the existing rebellion," on condition that they take an
oath of loyalty to the union. he then announced that when, in any of the
states named, a body of voters, qualified under the law as it stood
before secession and equal in number to one-tenth the votes cast in
1860, took the oath of allegiance, they should be permitted to
reestablish a state government. such a government, he added, should be
recognized as a lawful authority and entitled to protection under the
federal constitution. with reference to the status of the former slaves
lincoln made it clear that, while their freedom must be recognized, he
would not object to any legislation "which may yet be consistent as a
temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring,
landless, and homeless class."

=andrew johnson's plan--his impeachment.=--lincoln's successor, andrew
johnson, the vice president, soon after taking office, proposed to
pursue a somewhat similar course. in a number of states he appointed
military governors, instructing them at the earliest possible moment to
assemble conventions, chosen "by that portion of the people of the said
states who are loyal to the united states," and proceed to the
organization of regular civil government. johnson, a southern man and a
democrat, was immediately charged by the republicans with being too
ready to restore the southern states. as the months went by, the
opposition to his measures and policies in congress grew in size and
bitterness. the contest resulted in the impeachment of johnson by the
house of representatives in march, 1868, and his acquittal by the senate
merely because his opponents lacked one vote of the two-thirds required
for conviction.

=congress enacts "reconstruction laws."=--in fact, congress was in a
strategic position. it was the law-making body, and it could, moreover,
determine the conditions under which senators and representatives from
the south were to be readmitted. it therefore proceeded to pass a series
of reconstruction acts--carrying all of them over johnson's veto. these
measures, the first of which became a law on march 2, 1867, betrayed an
animus not found anywhere in lincoln's plans or johnson's proclamations.

they laid off the ten states--the whole confederacy with the exception
of tennessee--still outside the pale, into five military districts, each
commanded by a military officer appointed by the president. they ordered
the commanding general to prepare a register of voters for the election
of delegates to conventions chosen for the purpose of drafting new
constitutions. such voters, however, were not to be, as lincoln had
suggested, loyal persons duly qualified under the law existing before
secession but "the male citizens of said state, twenty-one years old and
upward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition, ... except such
as may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion or for felony
at common law." this was the death knell to the idea that the leaders of
the confederacy and their white supporters might be permitted to share
in the establishment of the new order. power was thus arbitrarily thrust
into the hands of the newly emancipated male negroes and the handful of
whites who could show a record of loyalty. that was not all. each state
was, under the reconstruction acts, compelled to ratify the fourteenth
amendment to the federal constitution as a price of restoration to the
union.

the composition of the conventions thus authorized may be imagined.
bondmen without the asking and without preparation found themselves the
governing power. an army of adventurers from the north, "carpet baggers"
as they were called, poured in upon the scene to aid in
"reconstruction." undoubtedly many men of honor and fine intentions gave
unstinted service, but the results of their deliberations only
aggravated the open wound left by the war. any number of political
doctors offered their prescriptions; but no effective remedy could be
found. under measures admittedly open to grave objections, the southern
states were one after another restored to the union by the grace of
congress, the last one in 1870. even this grudging concession of the
formalities of statehood did not mean a full restoration of honors and
privileges. the last soldier was not withdrawn from the last southern
capital until 1877, and federal control over elections long remained as
a sign of congressional supremacy.

=the status of the freedmen.=--even more intricate than the issues
involved in restoring the seceded states to the union was the question
of what to do with the newly emancipated slaves. that problem, often put
to abolitionists before the war, had become at last a real concern. the
thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery had not touched it at all. it
declared bondmen free, but did nothing to provide them with work or
homes and did not mention the subject of political rights. all these
matters were left to the states, and the legislatures of some of them,
by their famous "black codes," restored a form of servitude under the
guise of vagrancy and apprentice laws. such methods were in fact partly
responsible for the reaction that led congress to abandon lincoln's
policies and undertake its own program of reconstruction.

still no extensive effort was made to solve by law the economic problems
of the bondmen. radical abolitionists had advocated that the slaves when
emancipated should be given outright the fields of their former
masters; but congress steadily rejected the very idea of confiscation.
the necessity of immediate assistance it recognized by creating in 1865
the freedmen's bureau to take care of refugees. it authorized the issue
of food and clothing to the destitute and the renting of abandoned and
certain other lands under federal control to former slaves at reasonable
rates. but the larger problem of the relation of the freedmen to the
land, it left to the slow working of time.

against sharp protests from conservative men, particularly among the
democrats, congress did insist, however, on conferring upon the freedmen
certain rights by national law. these rights fell into broad divisions,
civil and political. by an act passed in 1866, congress gave to former
slaves the rights of white citizens in the matter of making contracts,
giving testimony in courts, and purchasing, selling, and leasing
property. as it was doubtful whether congress had the power to enact
this law, there was passed and submitted to the states the fourteenth
amendment which gave citizenship to the freedmen, assured them of the
privileges and immunities of citizens of the united states, and declared
that no state should deprive any person of his life, liberty, or
property without due process of law. not yet satisfied, congress
attempted to give social equality to negroes by the second civil rights
bill of 1875 which promised to them, among other things, the full and
equal enjoyment of inns, theaters, public conveyances, and places of
amusement--a law later declared unconstitutional by the supreme court.

the matter of political rights was even more hotly contested; but the
radical republicans, like charles sumner, asserted that civil rights
were not secure unless supported by the suffrage. in this same
fourteenth amendment they attempted to guarantee the ballot to all negro
men, leaving the women to take care of themselves. the amendment
declared in effect that when any state deprived adult male citizens of
the right to vote, its representation in congress should be reduced in
the proportion such persons bore to the voting population.

this provision having failed to accomplish its purpose, the fifteenth
amendment was passed and ratified, expressly declaring that no citizen
should be deprived of the right to vote "on account of race, color, or
previous condition of servitude." to make assurance doubly secure,
congress enacted in 1870, 1872, and 1873 three drastic laws, sometimes
known as "force bills," providing for the use of federal authorities,
civil and military, in supervising elections in all parts of the union.
so the federal government, having destroyed chattel slavery, sought by
legal decree to sweep away all its signs and badges, civil, social, and
political. never, save perhaps in some of the civil conflicts of greece
or rome, had there occurred in the affairs of a nation a social
revolution so complete, so drastic, and far-reaching in its results.


summary of the sectional conflict

just as the united states, under the impetus of western enterprise,
rounded out the continental domain, its very existence as a nation was
challenged by a fratricidal conflict between two sections. this storm
had been long gathering upon the horizon. from the very beginning in
colonial times there had been a marked difference between the south and
the north. the former by climate and soil was dedicated to a planting
system--the cultivation of tobacco, rice, cotton, and sugar cane--and in
the course of time slave labor became the foundation of the system. the
north, on the other hand, supplemented agriculture by commerce, trade,
and manufacturing. slavery, though lawful, did not flourish there. an
abundant supply of free labor kept the northern wheels turning.

this difference between the two sections, early noted by close
observers, was increased with the advent of the steam engine and the
factory system. between 1815 and 1860 an industrial revolution took
place in the north. its signs were gigantic factories, huge aggregations
of industrial workers, immense cities, a flourishing commerce, and
prosperous banks. finding an unfavorable reception in the south, the new
industrial system was confined mainly to the north. by canals and
railways new york, boston, and philadelphia were linked with the
wheatfields of ohio, indiana, and illinois. a steel net wove north and
northwest together. a commercial net supplemented it. western trade was
diverted from new orleans to the east and eastern credit sustained
western enterprise.

in time, the industrial north and the planting south evolved different
ideas of political policy. the former looked with favor on protective
tariffs, ship subsidies, a sound national banking system, and internal
improvements. the farmers of the west demanded that the public domain be
divided up into free homesteads for farmers. the south steadily swung
around to the opposite view. its spokesmen came to regard most of these
policies as injurious to the planting interests.

the economic questions were all involved in a moral issue. the northern
states, in which slavery was of slight consequence, had early abolished
the institution. in the course of a few years there appeared
uncompromising advocates of universal emancipation. far and wide the
agitation spread. the south was thoroughly frightened. it demanded
protection against the agitators, the enforcement of its rights in the
case of runaway slaves, and equal privileges for slavery in the new
territories.

with the passing years the conflict between the two sections increased
in bitterness. it flamed up in 1820 and was allayed by the missouri
compromise. it took on the form of a tariff controversy and
nullification in 1832. it appeared again after the mexican war when the
question of slavery in the new territories was raised. again
compromise--the great settlement of 1850--seemed to restore peace, only
to prove an illusion. a series of startling events swept the country
into war: the repeal of the missouri compromise in 1854, the rise of the
republican party pledged to the prohibition of slavery in the
territories, the dred scott decision of 1857, the lincoln-douglas
debates, john brown's raid, the election of lincoln, and secession.

the civil war, lasting for four years, tested the strength of both north
and south, in leadership, in finance, in diplomatic skill, in material
resources, in industry, and in armed forces. by the blockade of southern
ports, by an overwhelming weight of men and materials, and by relentless
hammering on the field of battle, the north was victorious.

the results of the war were revolutionary in character. slavery was
abolished and the freedmen given the ballot. the southern planters who
had been the leaders of their section were ruined financially and almost
to a man excluded from taking part in political affairs. the union was
declared to be perpetual and the right of a state to secede settled by
the judgment of battle. federal control over the affairs of states,
counties, and cities was established by the fourteenth amendment. the
power and prestige of the federal government were enhanced beyond
imagination. the north was now free to pursue its economic policies: a
protective tariff, a national banking system, land grants for railways,
free lands for farmers. planting had dominated the country for nearly a
generation. business enterprise was to take its place.

part vi. national growth and world politics




chapter xvi

the political and economic evolution of the south


the outcome of the civil war in the south was nothing short of a
revolution. the ruling class, the law, and the government of the old
order had been subverted. to political chaos was added the havoc wrought
in agriculture, business, and transportation by military operations. and
as if to fill the cup to the brim, the task of reconstruction was
committed to political leaders from another section of the country,
strangers to the life and traditions of the south.


the south at the close of the war

=a ruling class disfranchised.=--as the sovereignty of the planters had
been the striking feature of the old regime, so their ruin was the
outstanding fact of the new. the situation was extraordinary. the
american revolution was carried out by people experienced in the arts of
self-government, and at its close they were free to follow the general
course to which they had long been accustomed. the french revolution
witnessed the overthrow of the clergy and the nobility; but middle
classes who took their places had been steadily rising in intelligence
and wealth.

the southern revolution was unlike either of these cataclysms. it was
not brought about by a social upheaval, but by an external crisis. it
did not enfranchise a class that sought and understood power, but
bondmen who had played no part in the struggle. moreover it struck down
a class equipped to rule. the leading planters were almost to a man
excluded from state and federal offices, and the fourteenth amendment
was a bar to their return. all civil and military places under the
authority of the united states and of the states were closed to every
man who had taken an oath to support the constitution as a member of
congress, as a state legislator, or as a state or federal officer, and
afterward engaged in "insurrection or rebellion," or "given aid and
comfort to the enemies" of the united states. this sweeping provision,
supplemented by the reconstruction acts, laid under the ban most of the
talent, energy, and spirit of the south.

=the condition of the state governments.=--the legislative, executive,
and judicial branches of the state governments thus passed into the
control of former slaves, led principally by northern adventurers or
southern novices, known as "scalawags." the result was a carnival of
waste, folly, and corruption. the "reconstruction" assembly of south
carolina bought clocks at $480 apiece and chandeliers at $650. to
purchase land for former bondmen the sum of $800,000 was appropriated;
and swamps bought at seventy-five cents an acre were sold to the state
at five times the cost. in the years between 1868 and 1873, the debt of
the state rose from about $5,800,000 to $24,000,000, and millions of the
increase could not be accounted for by the authorities responsible for
it.

=economic ruin--urban and rural.=--no matter where southern men turned
in 1865 they found devastation--in the towns, in the country, and along
the highways. atlanta, the city to which sherman applied the torch, lay
in ashes; nashville and chattanooga had been partially wrecked; richmond
and augusta had suffered severely from fires. charleston was described
by a visitor as "a city of ruins, of desolation, of vacant houses, of
rotten wharves, of deserted warehouses, of weed gardens, of miles of
grass-grown streets.... how few young men there are, how generally the
young women are dressed in black! the flower of their proud aristocracy
is buried on scores of battle fields."

those who journeyed through the country about the same time reported
desolation equally widespread and equally pathetic. an english traveler
who made his way along the course of the tennessee river in 1870 wrote:
"the trail of war is visible throughout the valley in burnt-up gin
houses, ruined bridges, mills, and factories ... and large tracts of
once cultivated land are stripped of every vestige of fencing. the
roads, long neglected, are in disorder and, having in many places become
impassable, new tracks have been made through the woods and fields
without much respect to boundaries." many a great plantation had been
confiscated by the federal authorities while the owner was in
confederate service. many more lay in waste. in the wake of the armies
the homes of rich and poor alike, if spared the torch, had been
despoiled of the stock and seeds necessary to renew agriculture.

=railways dilapidated.=--transportation was still more demoralized. this
is revealed in the pages of congressional reports based upon first-hand
investigations. one eloquent passage illustrates all the rest. from
pocahontas to decatur, alabama, a distance of 114 miles, we are told,
the railroad was "almost entirely destroyed, except the road bed and
iron rails, and they were in a very bad condition--every bridge and
trestle destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water tanks
gone, tracks grown up in weeds and bushes, not a saw mill near the line
and the labor system of the country gone. about forty miles of the track
were burned, the cross-ties entirely destroyed, and the rails bent and
twisted in such a manner as to require great labor to straighten and a
large portion of them requiring renewal."

=capital and credit destroyed.=--the fluid capital of the south, money
and credit, was in the same prostrate condition as the material capital.
the confederate currency, inflated to the bursting point, had utterly
collapsed and was as worthless as waste paper. the bonds of the
confederate government were equally valueless. specie had nearly
disappeared from circulation. the fourteenth amendment to the federal
constitution had made all "debts, obligations, and claims" incurred in
aid of the confederate cause "illegal and void." millions of dollars
owed to northern creditors before the war were overdue and payment was
pressed upon the debtors. where such debts were secured by mortgages on
land, executions against the property could be obtained in federal
courts.


the restoration of white supremacy

=intimidation.=--in both politics and economics, the process of
reconstruction in the south was slow and arduous. the first battle in
the political contest for white supremacy was won outside the halls of
legislatures and the courts of law. it was waged, in the main, by secret
organizations, among which the ku klux klan and the white camelia were
the most prominent. the first of these societies appeared in tennessee
in 1866 and held its first national convention the following year. it
was in origin a social club. according to its announcement, its objects
were "to protect the weak, the innocent, and the defenceless from the
indignities, wrongs, and outrages of the lawless, the violent, and the
brutal; and to succor the suffering, especially the widows and orphans
of the confederate soldiers." the whole south was called "the empire"
and was ruled by a "grand wizard." each state was a realm and each
county a province. in the secret orders there were enrolled over half a
million men.

the methods of the ku klux and the white camelia were similar. solemn
parades of masked men on horses decked in long robes were held,
sometimes in the daytime and sometimes at the dead of night. notices
were sent to obnoxious persons warning them to stop certain practices.
if warning failed, something more convincing was tried. fright was the
emotion most commonly stirred. a horseman, at the witching hour of
midnight, would ride up to the house of some offender, lift his head
gear, take off a skull, and hand it to the trembling victim with the
request that he hold it for a few minutes. frequently violence was
employed either officially or unofficially by members of the klan. tar
and feathers were freely applied; the whip was sometimes laid on
unmercifully, and occasionally a brutal murder was committed. often the
members were fired upon from bushes or behind trees, and swift
retaliation followed. so alarming did the clashes become that in 1870
congress forbade interference with electors or going in disguise for the
purpose of obstructing the exercise of the rights enjoyed under federal
law.

in anticipation of such a step on the part of the federal government,
the ku klux was officially dissolved by the "grand wizard" in 1869.
nevertheless, the local societies continued their organization and
methods. the spirit survived the national association. "on the whole,"
says a southern writer, "it is not easy to see what other course was
open to the south.... armed resistance was out of the question. and yet
there must be some control had of the situation.... if force was denied,
craft was inevitable."

=the struggle for the ballot box.=--the effects of intimidation were
soon seen at elections. the freedman, into whose inexperienced hand the
ballot had been thrust, was ordinarily loath to risk his head by the
exercise of his new rights. he had not attained them by a long and
laborious contest of his own and he saw no urgent reason why he should
battle for the privilege of using them. the mere show of force, the mere
existence of a threat, deterred thousands of ex-slaves from appearing at
the polls. thus the whites steadily recovered their dominance. nothing
could prevent it. congress enacted force bills establishing federal
supervision of elections and the northern politicians protested against
the return of former confederates to practical, if not official, power;
but all such opposition was like resistance to the course of nature.

=amnesty for southerners.=--the recovery of white supremacy in this way
was quickly felt in national councils. the democratic party in the north
welcomed it as a sign of its return to power. the more moderate
republicans, anxious to heal the breach in american unity, sought to
encourage rather than to repress it. so it came about that amnesty for
confederates was widely advocated. yet it must be said that the struggle
for the removal of disabilities was stubborn and bitter. lincoln, with
characteristic generosity, in the midst of the war had issued a general
proclamation of amnesty to nearly all who had been in arms against the
union, on condition that they take an oath of loyalty; but johnson,
vindictive toward southern leaders and determined to make "treason
infamous," had extended the list of exceptions. congress, even more
relentless in its pursuit of confederates, pushed through the fourteenth
amendment which worked the sweeping disabilities we have just described.

to appeals for comprehensive clemency, congress was at first adamant. in
vain did men like carl schurz exhort their colleagues to crown their
victory in battle with a noble act of universal pardon and oblivion.
congress would not yield. it would grant amnesty in individual cases;
for the principle of proscription it stood fast. when finally in 1872,
seven years after the surrender at appomattox, it did pass the general
amnesty bill, it insisted on certain exceptions. confederates who had
been members of congress just before the war, or had served in other
high posts, civil or military, under the federal government, were still
excluded from important offices. not until the summer of 1898, when the
war with spain produced once more a union of hearts, did congress relent
and abolish the last of the disabilities imposed on the confederates.

=the force bills attacked and nullified.=--the granting of amnesty
encouraged the democrats to redouble their efforts all along the line.
in 1874 they captured the house of representatives and declared war on
the "force bills." as a republican senate blocked immediate repeal, they
resorted to an ingenious parliamentary trick. to the appropriation bill
for the support of the army they attached a "rider," or condition, to
the effect that no troops should be used to sustain the republican
government in louisiana. the senate rejected the proposal. a deadlock
ensued and congress adjourned without making provision for the army.
satisfied with the technical victory, the democrats let the army bill
pass the next session, but kept up their fight on the force laws until
they wrung from president hayes a measure forbidding the use of united
states troops in supervising elections. the following year they again
had recourse to a rider on the army bill and carried it through, putting
an end to the use of money for military control of elections. the
reconstruction program was clearly going to pieces, and the supreme
court helped along the process of dissolution by declaring parts of the
laws invalid. in 1878 the democrats even won a majority in the senate
and returned to power a large number of men once prominent in the
confederate cause.

the passions of the war by this time were evidently cooling. a new
generation of men was coming on the scene. the supremacy of the whites
in the south, if not yet complete, was at least assured. federal
marshals, their deputies, and supervisors of elections still possessed
authority over the polls, but their strength had been shorn by the
withdrawal of united states troops. the war on the remaining remnants of
the "force bills" lapsed into desultory skirmishing. when in 1894 the
last fragment was swept away, the country took little note of the fact.
the only task that lay before the southern leaders was to write in the
constitutions of their respective states the provisions of law which
would clinch the gains so far secured and establish white supremacy
beyond the reach of outside intervention.

=white supremacy sealed by new state constitutions.=--the impetus to
this final step was given by the rise of the populist movement in the
south, which sharply divided the whites and in many communities threw
the balance of power into the hands of the few colored voters who
survived the process of intimidation. southern leaders now devised new
constitutions so constructed as to deprive negroes of the ballot by law.
mississippi took the lead in 1890; south carolina followed five years
later; louisiana, in 1898; north carolina, in 1900; alabama and
maryland, in 1901; and virginia, in 1902.

the authors of these measures made no attempt to conceal their purposes.
"the intelligent white men of the south," said governor tillman, "intend
to govern here." the fifteenth amendment to the federal constitution,
however, forbade them to deprive any citizen of the right to vote on
account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. this made
necessary the devices of indirection. they were few, simple, and
effective. the first and most easily administered was the ingenious
provision requiring each prospective voter to read a section of the
state constitution or "understand and explain it" when read to him by
the election officers. as an alternative, the payment of taxes or the
ownership of a small amount of property was accepted as a qualification
for voting. southern leaders, unwilling to disfranchise any of the poor
white men who had stood side by side with them "in the dark days of
reconstruction," also resorted to a famous provision known as "the
grandfather clause." this plan admitted to the suffrage any man who did
not have either property or educational qualifications, provided he had
voted on or before 1867 or was the son or grandson of any such person.

the devices worked effectively. of the 147,000 negroes in mississippi
above the age of twenty-one, only about 8600 registered under the
constitution of 1890. louisiana had 127,000 colored voters enrolled in
1896; under the constitution drafted two years later the registration
fell to 5300. an analysis of the figures for south carolina in 1900
indicates that only about one negro out of every hundred adult males of
that race took part in elections. thus was closed this chapter of
reconstruction.

=the supreme court refuses to intervene.=--numerous efforts were made to
prevail upon the supreme court of the united states to declare such laws
unconstitutional; but the court, usually on technical grounds, avoided
coming to a direct decision on the merits of the matter. in one case
the court remarked that it could not take charge of and operate the
election machinery of alabama; it concluded that "relief from a great
political wrong, if done as alleged, by the people of a state and by the
state itself, must be given by them, or by the legislative and executive
departments of the government of the united states." only one of the
several schemes employed, namely, the "grandfather clause," was held to
be a violation of the federal constitution. this blow, effected in 1915
by the decision in the oklahoma and maryland cases, left, however, the
main structure of disfranchisement unimpaired.

=proposals to reduce southern representation in congress.=--these
provisions excluding thousands of male citizens from the ballot did not,
in express terms, deprive any one of the vote on account of race or
color. they did not, therefore, run counter to the letter of the
fifteenth amendment; but they did unquestionably make the states which
adopted them liable to the operations of the fourteenth amendment. the
latter very explicitly provides that whenever any state deprives adult
male citizens of the right to vote (except in certain minor cases) the
representation of the state in congress shall be reduced in the
proportion which such number of disfranchised citizens bears to the
whole number of male citizens over twenty-one years of age.

mindful of this provision, those who protested against disfranchisement
in the south turned to the republican party for relief, asking for
action by the political branches of the federal government as the
supreme court had suggested. the republicans responded in their platform
of 1908 by condemning all devices designed to deprive any one of the
ballot for reasons of color alone; they demanded the enforcement in
letter and spirit of the fourteenth as well as all other amendments.
though victorious in the election, the republicans refrained from
reopening the ancient contest; they made no attempt to reduce southern
representation in the house. southern leaders, while protesting against
the declarations of their opponents, were able to view them as idle
threats in no way endangering the security of the measures by which
political reconstruction had been undone.

=the solid south.=--out of the thirty-year conflict against "carpet-bag
rule" there emerged what was long known as the "solid south"--a south
that, except occasionally in the border states, never gave an electoral
vote to a republican candidate for president. before the civil war, the
southern people had been divided on political questions. take, for
example, the election of 1860. in all the fifteen slave states the
variety of opinion was marked. in nine of them--delaware, virginia,
tennessee, missouri, maryland, louisiana, kentucky, georgia, and
arkansas--the combined vote against the representative of the extreme
southern point of view, breckinridge, constituted a safe majority. in
each of the six states which were carried by breckinridge, there was a
large and powerful minority. in north carolina breckinridge's majority
over bell and douglas was only 849 votes. equally astounding to those
who imagine the south united in defense of extreme views in 1860 was the
vote for bell, the unionist candidate, who stood firmly for the
constitution and silence on slavery. in every southern state bell's vote
was large. in virginia, kentucky, missouri, and tennessee it was greater
than that received by breckinridge; in georgia, it was 42,000 against
51,000; in louisiana, 20,000 against 22,000; in mississippi, 25,000
against 40,000.

the effect of the civil war upon these divisions was immediate and
decisive, save in the border states where thousands of men continued to
adhere to the cause of union. in the confederacy itself nearly all
dissent was silenced by war. men who had been bitter opponents joined
hands in defense of their homes; when the armed conflict was over they
remained side by side working against "republican misrule and negro
domination." by 1890, after northern supremacy was definitely broken,
they boasted that there were at least twelve southern states in which no
republican candidate for president could win a single electoral vote.

=dissent in the solid south.=--though every one grew accustomed to speak
of the south as "solid," it did not escape close observers that in a
number of southern states there appeared from time to time a fairly
large body of dissenters. in 1892 the populists made heavy inroads upon
the democratic ranks. on other occasions, the contests between factions
within the democratic party over the nomination of candidates revealed
sharp differences of opinion. in some places, moreover, there grew up a
republican minority of respectable size. for example, in georgia, mr.
taft in 1908 polled 41,000 votes against 72,000 for mr. bryan; in north
carolina, 114,000 against 136,000; in tennessee, 118,000 against
135,000; in kentucky, 235,000 against 244,000. in 1920, senator harding,
the republican candidate, broke the record by carrying tennessee as well
as kentucky, oklahoma, and maryland.


the economic advance of the south

=the break-up of the great estates.=--in the dissolution of chattel
slavery it was inevitable that the great estate should give way before
the small farm. the plantation was in fact founded on slavery. it was
continued and expanded by slavery. before the war the prosperous
planter, either by inclination or necessity, invested his surplus in
more land to add to his original domain. as his slaves increased in
number, he was forced to increase his acreage or sell them, and he
usually preferred the former, especially in the far south. still another
element favored the large estate. slave labor quickly exhausted the soil
and of its own force compelled the cutting of the forests and the
extension of the area under cultivation. finally, the planter took a
natural pride in his great estate; it was a sign of his prowess and his
social prestige.

in 1865 the foundations of the planting system were gone. it was
difficult to get efficient labor to till the vast plantations. the
planters themselves were burdened with debts and handicapped by lack of
capital. negroes commonly preferred tilling plots of their own, rented
or bought under mortgage, to the more irksome wage labor under white
supervision. the land hunger of the white farmer, once checked by the
planting system, reasserted itself. before these forces the plantation
broke up. the small farm became the unit of cultivation in the south as
in the north. between 1870 and 1900 the number of farms doubled in every
state south of the line of the potomac and ohio rivers, except in
arkansas and louisiana. from year to year the process of breaking up
continued, with all that it implied in the creation of land-owning
farmers.

=the diversification of crops.=--no less significant was the concurrent
diversification of crops. under slavery, tobacco, rice, and sugar were
staples and "cotton was king." these were standard crops. the methods of
cultivation were simple and easily learned. they tested neither the
skill nor the ingenuity of the slaves. as the returns were quick, they
did not call for long-time investments of capital. after slavery was
abolished, they still remained the staples, but far-sighted
agriculturists saw the dangers of depending upon a few crops. the mild
climate all the way around the coast from virginia to texas and the
character of the alluvial soil invited the exercise of more imagination.
peaches, oranges, peanuts, and other fruits and vegetables were found to
grow luxuriantly. refrigeration for steamships and freight cars put the
markets of great cities at the doors of southern fruit and vegetable
gardeners. the south, which in planting days had relied so heavily upon
the northwest for its foodstuffs, began to battle for independence.
between 1880 and the close of the century the value of its farm crops
increased from $660,000,000 to $1,270,000,000.

=the industrial and commercial revolution.=--on top of the radical
changes in agriculture came an industrial and commercial revolution. the
south had long been rich in natural resources, but the slave system had
been unfavorable to their development. rivers that would have turned
millions of spindles tumbled unheeded to the seas. coal and iron beds
lay unopened. timber was largely sacrificed in clearing lands for
planting, or fell to earth in decay. southern enterprise was consumed in
planting. slavery kept out the white immigrants who might have supplied
the skilled labor for industry.

after 1865, achievement and fortune no longer lay on the land alone. as
soon as the paralysis of the war was over, the south caught the
industrial spirit that had conquered feudal europe and the agricultural
north. in the development of mineral wealth, enormous strides were
taken. iron ore of every quality was found, the chief beds being in
virginia, west virginia, tennessee, kentucky, north carolina, georgia,
alabama, arkansas, and texas. five important coal basins were uncovered:
in virginia, north carolina, the appalachian chain from maryland to
northern alabama, kentucky, arkansas, and texas. oil pools were found
in kentucky, tennessee, and texas. within two decades, 1880 to 1900, the
output of mineral wealth multiplied tenfold: from ten millions a year to
one hundred millions. the iron industries of west virginia and alabama
began to rival those of pennsylvania. birmingham became the pittsburgh
and atlanta the chicago of the south.

a southern cotton mill in a cotton field]

in other lines of industry, lumbering and cotton manufacturing took a
high rank. the development of southern timber resources was in every
respect remarkable, particularly in louisiana, arkansas, and
mississippi. at the end of the first decade of the twentieth century,
primacy in lumber had passed from the great lakes region to the south.
in 1913 eight southern states produced nearly four times as much lumber
as the lake states and twice as much as the vast forests of washington
and oregon.

the development of the cotton industry, in the meantime, was similarly
astounding. in 1865 cotton spinning was a negligible matter in the
southern states. in 1880 they had one-fourth of the mills of the
country. at the end of the century they had one-half the mills, the two
carolinas taking the lead by consuming more than one-third of their
entire cotton crop. having both the raw materials and the power at hand,
they enjoyed many advantages over the new england rivals, and at the
opening of the new century were outstripping the latter in the
proportion of spindles annually put into operation. moreover, the cotton
planters, finding a market at the neighboring mills, began to look
forward to a day when they would be somewhat emancipated from absolute
dependence upon the cotton exchanges of new york, new orleans, and
liverpool.

transportation kept pace with industry. in 1860, the south had about ten
thousand miles of railway. by 1880 the figure had doubled. during the
next twenty years over thirty thousand miles were added, most of the
increase being in texas. about 1898 there opened a period of
consolidation in which scores of short lines were united, mainly under
the leadership of northern capitalists, and new through service opened
to the north and west. thus southern industries were given easy outlets
to the markets of the nation and brought within the main currents of
national business enterprise.

=the social effects of the economic changes.=--as long as the slave
system lasted and planting was the major interest, the south was bound
to be sectional in character. with slavery gone, crops diversified,
natural resources developed, and industries promoted, the social order
of the ante-bellum days inevitably dissolved; the south became more and
more assimilated to the system of the north. in this process several
lines of development are evident.

in the first place we see the steady rise of the small farmer. even in
the old days there had been a large class of white yeomen who owned no
slaves and tilled the soil with their own hands, but they labored under
severe handicaps. they found the fertile lands of the coast and river
valleys nearly all monopolized by planters, and they were by the force
of circumstances driven into the uplands where the soil was thin and the
crops were light. still they increased in numbers and zealously worked
their freeholds.

the war proved to be their opportunity. with the break-up of the
plantations, they managed to buy land more worthy of their plows. by
intelligent labor and intensive cultivation they were able to restore
much of the worn-out soil to its original fertility. in the meantime
they rose with their prosperity in the social and political scale. it
became common for the sons of white farmers to enter the professions,
while their daughters went away to college and prepared for teaching.
thus a more democratic tone was given to the white society of the south.
moreover the migration to the north and west, which had formerly carried
thousands of energetic sons and daughters to search for new homesteads,
was materially reduced. the energy of the agricultural population went
into rehabilitation.

the increase in the number of independent farmers was accompanied by the
rise of small towns and villages which gave diversity to the life of the
south. before 1860 it was possible to travel through endless stretches
of cotton and tobacco. the social affairs of the planter's family
centered in the homestead even if they were occasionally interrupted by
trips to distant cities or abroad. carpentry, bricklaying, and
blacksmithing were usually done by slaves skilled in simple handicrafts.
supplies were bought wholesale. in this way there was little place in
plantation economy for villages and towns with their stores and
mechanics.

the abolition of slavery altered this. small farms spread out where
plantations had once stood. the skilled freedmen turned to agriculture
rather than to handicrafts; white men of a business or mechanical bent
found an opportunity to serve the needs of their communities. so local
merchants and mechanics became an important element in the social
system. in the county seats, once dominated by the planters, business
and professional men assumed the leadership.

another vital outcome of this revolution was the transference of a large
part of planting enterprise to business. mr. bruce, a southern historian
of fine scholarship, has summed up this process in a single telling
paragraph: "the higher planting class that under the old system gave so
much distinction to rural life has, so far as it has survived at all,
been concentrated in the cities. the families that in the time of
slavery would have been found only in the country are now found, with a
few exceptions, in the towns. the transplantation has been practically
universal. the talent, the energy, the ambition that formerly sought
expression in the management of great estates and the control of hosts
of slaves, now seek a field of action in trade, in manufacturing
enterprises, or in the general enterprises of development. this was for
the ruling class of the south the natural outcome of the great economic
revolution that followed the war."

as in all other parts of the world, the mechanical revolution was
attended by the growth of a population of industrial workers dependent
not upon the soil but upon wages for their livelihood. when jefferson
davis was inaugurated president of the southern confederacy, there were
approximately only one hundred thousand persons employed in southern
manufactures as against more than a million in northern mills. fifty
years later, georgia and alabama alone had more than one hundred and
fifty thousand wage-earners. necessarily this meant also a material
increase in urban population, although the wide dispersion of cotton
spinning among small centers prevented the congestion that had
accompanied the rise of the textile industry in new england. in 1910,
new orleans, atlanta, memphis, nashville, and houston stood in the same
relation to the new south that cincinnati, chicago, cleveland, and
detroit had stood to the new west fifty years before. the problems of
labor and capital and municipal administration, which the earlier
writers boasted would never perplex the planting south, had come in full
force.

=the revolution in the status of the slaves.=--no part of southern
society was so profoundly affected by the civil war and economic
reconstruction as the former slaves. on the day of emancipation, they
stood free, but empty-handed, the owners of no tools or property, the
masters of no trade and wholly inexperienced in the arts of self-help
that characterized the whites in general. they had never been accustomed
to looking out for themselves. the plantation bell had called them to
labor and released them. doles of food and clothing had been regularly
made in given quantities. they did not understand wages, ownership,
renting, contracts, mortgages, leases, bills, or accounts.

when they were emancipated, four courses were open to them. they could
flee from the plantation to the nearest town or city, or to the distant
north, to seek a livelihood. thousands of them chose this way,
overcrowding cities where disease mowed them down. they could remain
where they, were in their cabins and work for daily wages instead of
food, clothing, and shelter. this second course the major portion of
them chose; but, as few masters had cash to dispense, the new relation
was much like the old, in fact. it was still one of barter. the planter
offered food, clothing, and shelter; the former slaves gave their labor
in return. that was the best that many of them could do.

a third course open to freedmen was that of renting from the former
master, paying him usually with a share of the produce of the land. this
way a large number of them chose. it offered them a chance to become
land owners in time and it afforded an easier life, the renter being, to
a certain extent at least, master of his own hours of labor. the final
and most difficult path was that to ownership of land. many a master
helped his former slaves to acquire small holdings by offering easy
terms. the more enterprising and the more fortunate who started life as
renters or wage-earners made their way upward to ownership in so many
cases that by the end of the century, one-fourth of the colored laborers
on the land owned the soil they tilled.

in the meantime, the south, though relatively poor, made relatively
large expenditures for the education of the colored population. by the
opening of the twentieth century, facilities were provided for more than
one-half of the colored children of school age. while in many respects
this progress was disappointing, its significance, to be appreciated,
must be derived from a comparison with the total illiteracy which
prevailed under slavery.

in spite of all that happened, however, the status of the negroes in the
south continued to give a peculiar character to that section of the
country. they were almost entirely excluded from the exercise of the
suffrage, especially in the far south. special rooms were set aside for
them at the railway stations and special cars on the railway lines. in
the field of industry calling for technical skill, it appears, from the
census figures, that they lost ground between 1890 and 1900--a condition
which their friends ascribed to discriminations against them in law and
in labor organizations and their critics ascribed to their lack of
aptitude. whatever may be the truth, the fact remained that at the
opening of the twentieth century neither the hopes of the emancipators
nor the fears of their opponents were realized. the marks of the
"peculiar institution" were still largely impressed upon southern
society.

the situation, however, was by no means unchanging. on the contrary
there was a decided drift in affairs. for one thing, the proportion of
negroes in the south had slowly declined. by 1900 they were in a
majority in only two states, south carolina and mississippi. in
arkansas, virginia, west virginia, and north carolina the proportion of
the white population was steadily growing. the colored migration
northward increased while the westward movement of white farmers which
characterized pioneer days declined. at the same time a part of the
foreign immigration into the united states was diverted southward. as
the years passed these tendencies gained momentum. the already huge
colored quarters in some northern cities were widely expanded, as whole
counties in the south were stripped of their colored laborers. the race
question, in its political and economic aspects, became less and less
sectional, more and more national. the south was drawn into the main
stream of national life. the separatist forces which produced the
cataclysm of 1861 sank irresistibly into the background.

chapter xvii

business enterprise and the republican party


if a single phrase be chosen to characterize american life during the
generation that followed the age of douglas and lincoln, it must be
"business enterprise"--the tremendous, irresistible energy of a virile
people, mounting in numbers toward a hundred million and applied without
let or hindrance to the developing of natural resources of unparalleled
richness. the chief goal of this effort was high profits for the
captains of industry, on the one hand; and high wages for the workers,
on the other. its signs, to use the language of a republican orator in
1876, were golden harvest fields, whirling spindles, turning wheels,
open furnace doors, flaming forges, and chimneys filled with eager fire.
the device blazoned on its shield and written over its factory doors was
"prosperity." a republican president was its "advance agent." released
from the hampering interference of the southern planters and the
confusing issues of the slavery controversy, business enterprise sprang
forward to the task of winning the entire country. then it flung its
outposts to the uttermost parts of the earth--europe, africa, and the
orient--where were to be found markets for american goods and natural
resources for american capital to develop.


railways and industry

=the outward signs of enterprise.=--it is difficult to comprehend all
the multitudinous activities of american business energy or to appraise
its effects upon the life and destiny of the american people; for beyond
the horizon of the twentieth century lie consequences as yet undreamed
of in our poor philosophy. statisticians attempt to record its
achievements in terms of miles of railways built, factories opened, men
and women employed, fortunes made, wages paid, cities founded, rivers
spanned, boxes, bales, and tons produced. historians apply standards of
comparison with the past. against the slow and leisurely stagecoach,
they set the swift express, rushing from new york to san francisco in
less time than washington consumed in his triumphal tour from mt. vernon
to new york for his first inaugural. against the lazy sailing vessel
drifting before a genial breeze, they place the turbine steamer crossing
the atlantic in five days or the still swifter airplane, in fifteen
hours. for the old workshop where a master and a dozen workmen and
apprentices wrought by hand, they offer the giant factory where ten
thousand persons attend the whirling wheels driven by steam. they write
of the "romance of invention" and the "captains of industry."

=the service of the railway.=--all this is fitting in its way. figures
and contrasts cannot, however, tell the whole story. take, for example,
the extension of railways. it is easy to relate that there were 30,000
miles in 1860; 166,000 in 1890; and 242,000 in 1910. it is easy to show
upon the map how a few straggling lines became a perfect mesh of closely
knitted railways; or how, like the tentacles of a great monster, the few
roads ending in the mississippi valley in 1860 were extended and
multiplied until they tapped every wheat field, mine, and forest beyond
the valley. all this, eloquent of enterprise as it truly is, does not
reveal the significance of railways for american life. it does not
indicate how railways made a continental market for american goods; nor
how they standardized the whole country, giving to cities on the
advancing frontier the leading features of cities in the old east; nor
how they carried to the pioneer the comforts of civilization; nor yet
how in the west they were the forerunners of civilization, the makers of
homesteads, the builders of states.

=government aid for railways.=--still the story is not ended. the
significant relation between railways and politics must not be
overlooked. the bounty of a lavish government, for example, made
possible the work of railway promoters. by the year 1872 the federal
government had granted in aid of railways 155,000,000 acres of land--an
area estimated as almost equal to pennsylvania, new york, connecticut,
rhode island, massachusetts, maine, new hampshire, and vermont. the
union pacific company alone secured from the federal government a free
right of way through the public domain, twenty sections of land with
each mile of railway, and a loan up to fifty millions of dollars secured
by a second mortgage on the company's property. more than half of the
northern tier of states lying against canada from lake michigan to the
pacific was granted to private companies in aid of railways and wagon
roads. about half of new mexico, arizona, and california was also given
outright to railway companies. these vast grants from the federal
government were supplemented by gifts from the states in land and by
subscriptions amounting to more than two hundred million dollars. the
history of these gifts and their relation to the political leaders that
engineered them would alone fill a large and interesting volume.

=railway fortunes and capital.=--out of this gigantic railway promotion,
the first really immense american fortunes were made. henry adams, the
grandson of john quincy adams, related that his grandfather on his
mother's side, peter brooks, on his death in 1849, left a fortune of two
million dollars, "supposed to be the largest estate in boston," then one
of the few centers of great riches. compared with the opulence that
sprang out of the union pacific, the northern pacific, the southern
pacific, with their subsidiary and component lines, the estate of peter
brooks was a poor man's heritage.

the capital invested in these railways was enormous beyond the
imagination of the men of the stagecoach generation. the total debt of
the united states incurred in the revolutionary war--a debt which those
of little faith thought the country could never pay--was reckoned at a
figure well under $75,000,000. when the union pacific railroad was
completed, there were outstanding against it $27,000,000 in first
mortgage bonds, $27,000,000 in second mortgage bonds held by the
government, $10,000,000 in income bonds, $10,000,000 in land grant
bonds, and, on top of that huge bonded indebtedness, $36,000,000 in
stock--making $110,000,000 in all. if the amount due the united states
government be subtracted, still there remained, in private hands, stocks
and bonds exceeding in value the whole national debt of hamilton's
day--a debt that strained all the resources of the federal government in
1790. such was the financial significance of the railways.

[illustration: railroads of the united states in 1918]

=growth and extension of industry.=--in the field of manufacturing,
mining, and metal working, the results of business enterprise far
outstripped, if measured in mere dollars, the results of railway
construction. by the end of the century there were about ten billion
dollars invested in factories alone and five million wage-earners
employed in them; while the total value of the output, fourteen billion
dollars, was fifteen times the figure for 1860. in the eastern states
industries multiplied. in the northwest territory, the old home of
jacksonian democracy, they overtopped agriculture. by the end of the
century, ohio had almost reached and illinois had surpassed
massachusetts in the annual value of manufacturing output.

that was not all. untold wealth in the form of natural resources was
discovered in the south and west. coal deposits were found in the
appalachians stretching from pennsylvania down to alabama, in michigan,
in the mississippi valley, and in the western mountains from north
dakota to new mexico. in nearly every coal-bearing region, iron was also
discovered and the great fields of michigan, wisconsin, and minnesota
soon rivaled those of the appalachian area. copper, lead, gold, and
silver in fabulous quantities were unearthed by the restless prospectors
who left no plain or mountain fastness unexplored. petroleum, first
pumped from the wells of pennsylvania in the summer of 1859, made new
fortunes equaling those of trade, railways, and land speculation. it
scattered its riches with an especially lavish hand through oklahoma,
texas, and california.

=the trust--an instrument of industrial progress.=--business enterprise,
under the direction of powerful men working single-handed, or of small
groups of men pooling their capital for one or more undertakings, had
not advanced far before there appeared upon the scene still mightier
leaders of even greater imagination. new constructive genius now brought
together and combined under one management hundreds of concerns or
thousands of miles of railways, revealing the magic strength of
cooperation on a national scale. price-cutting in oil, threatening ruin
to those engaged in the industry, as early as 1879, led a number of
companies in cleveland, pittsburgh, and philadelphia to unite in
price-fixing. three years later a group of oil interests formed a close
organization, placing all their stocks in the hands of trustees, among
whom was john d. rockefeller. the trustees, in turn, issued
certificates representing the share to which each participant was
entitled; and took over the management of the entire business. such was
the nature of the "trust," which was to play such an unique role in the
progress of america.

the idea of combination was applied in time to iron and steel, copper,
lead, sugar, cordage, coal, and other commodities, until in each field
there loomed a giant trust or corporation, controlling, if not most of
the output, at least enough to determine in a large measure the prices
charged to consumers. with the passing years, the railways, mills,
mines, and other business concerns were transferred from individual
owners to corporations. at the end of the nineteenth century, the whole
face of american business was changed. three-fourths of the output from
industries came from factories under corporate management and only
one-fourth from individual and partnership undertakings.

[illustration: john d. rockefeller]

=the banking corporation.=--very closely related to the growth of
business enterprise on a large scale was the system of banking. in the
old days before banks, a person with savings either employed them in his
own undertakings, lent them to a neighbor, or hid them away where they
set no industry in motion. even in the early stages of modern business,
it was common for a manufacturer to rise from small beginnings by
financing extensions out of his own earnings and profits. this state of
affairs was profoundly altered by the growth of the huge corporations
requiring millions and even billions of capital. the banks, once an
adjunct to business, became the leaders in business.

[illustration: _copyright by underwood and underwood, n.y._

wall street, new york city]

it was the banks that undertook to sell the stocks and bonds issued by
new corporations and trusts and to supply them with credit to carry on
their operations. indeed, many of the great mergers or combinations in
business were initiated by magnates in the banking world with millions
and billions under their control. through their connections with one
another, the banks formed a perfect network of agencies gathering up the
pennies and dollars of the masses as well as the thousands of the rich
and pouring them all into the channels of business and manufacturing.
in this growth of banking on a national scale, it was inevitable that a
few great centers, like wall street in new york or state street in
boston, should rise to a position of dominance both in concentrating the
savings and profits of the nation and in financing new as well as old
corporations.

=the significance of the corporation.=--the corporation, in fact, became
the striking feature of american business life, one of the most
marvelous institutions of all time, comparable in wealth and power and
the number of its servants with kingdoms and states of old. the effect
of its rise and growth cannot be summarily estimated; but some special
facts are obvious. it made possible gigantic enterprises once entirely
beyond the reach of any individual, no matter how rich. it eliminated
many of the futile and costly wastes of competition in connection with
manufacture, advertising, and selling. it studied the cheapest methods
of production and shut down mills that were poorly equipped or
disadvantageously located. it established laboratories for research in
industry, chemistry, and mechanical inventions. through the sale of
stocks and bonds, it enabled tens of thousands of people to become
capitalists, if only in a small way. the corporation made it possible
for one person to own, for instance, a $50 share in a million dollar
business concern--a thing entirely impossible under a regime of
individual owners and partnerships.

there was, of course, another side to the picture. many of the
corporations sought to become monopolies and to make profits, not by
economies and good management, but by extortion from purchasers.
sometimes they mercilessly crushed small business men, their
competitors, bribed members of legislatures to secure favorable laws,
and contributed to the campaign funds of both leading parties. wherever
a trust approached the position of a monopoly, it acquired a dominion
over the labor market which enabled it to break even the strongest trade
unions. in short, the power of the trust in finance, in manufacturing,
in politics, and in the field of labor control can hardly be measured.

=the corporation and labor.=--in the development of the corporation
there was to be observed a distinct severing of the old ties between
master and workmen, which existed in the days of small industries. for
the personal bond between the owner and the employees was substituted a
new relation. "in most parts of our country," as president wilson once
said, "men work, not for themselves, not as partners in the old way in
which they used to work, but generally as employees--in a higher or
lower grade--of great corporations." the owner disappeared from the
factory and in his place came the manager, representing the usually
invisible stockholders and dependent for his success upon his ability to
make profits for the owners. hence the term "soulless corporation,"
which was to exert such a deep influence on american thinking about
industrial relations.

=cities and immigration.=--expressed in terms of human life, this era of
unprecedented enterprise meant huge industrial cities and an immense
labor supply, derived mainly from european immigration. here, too,
figures tell only a part of the story. in washington's day nine-tenths
of the american people were engaged in agriculture and lived in the
country; in 1890 more than one-third of the population dwelt in towns of
2500 and over; in 1920 more than half of the population lived in towns
of over 2500. in forty years, between 1860 and 1900, greater new york
had grown from 1,174,000 to 3,437,000; san francisco from 56,000 to
342,000; chicago from 109,000 to 1,698,000. the miles of city tenements
began to rival, in the number of their residents, the farm homesteads of
the west. the time so dreaded by jefferson had arrived. people were
"piled upon one another in great cities" and the republic of small
farmers had passed away.

to these industrial centers flowed annually an ever-increasing tide of
immigration, reaching the half million point in 1880; rising to
three-quarters of a million three years later; and passing the million
mark in a single year at the opening of the new century. immigration was
as old as america but new elements now entered the situation. in the
first place, there were radical changes in the nationality of the
newcomers. the migration from northern europe--england, ireland,
germany, and scandinavia--diminished; that from italy, russia, and
austria-hungary increased, more than three-fourths of the entire number
coming from these three lands between the years 1900 and 1910. these
later immigrants were italians, poles, magyars, czechs, slovaks,
russians, and jews, who came from countries far removed from the
language and the traditions of england whence came the founders of
america.

in the second place, the reception accorded the newcomers differed from
that given to the immigrants in the early days. by 1890 all the free
land was gone. they could not, therefore, be dispersed widely among the
native americans to assimilate quickly and unconsciously the habits and
ideas of american life. on the contrary, they were diverted mainly to
the industrial centers. there they crowded--nay, overcrowded--into
colonies of their own where they preserved their languages, their
newspapers, and their old-world customs and views.

so eager were american business men to get an enormous labor supply that
they asked few questions about the effect of this "alien invasion" upon
the old america inherited from the fathers. they even stimulated the
invasion artificially by importing huge armies of foreigners under
contract to work in specified mines and mills. there seemed to be no
limit to the factories, forges, refineries, and railways that could be
built, to the multitudes that could be employed in conquering a
continent. as for the future, that was in the hands of providence!

=business theories of politics.=--as the statesmen of hamilton's school
and the planters of calhoun's had their theories of government and
politics, so the leaders in business enterprise had theirs. it was
simple and easily stated. "it is the duty of the government," they
urged, "to protect american industry against foreign competition by
means of high tariffs on imported goods, to aid railways by generous
grants of land, to sell mineral and timber lands at low prices to
energetic men ready to develop them, and then to leave the rest to the
initiative and drive of individuals and companies." all government
interference with the management, prices, rates, charges, and conduct of
private business they held to be either wholly pernicious or intolerably
impertinent. judging from their speeches and writings, they conceived
the nation as a great collection of individuals, companies, and labor
unions all struggling for profits or high wages and held together by a
government whose principal duty was to keep the peace among them and
protect industry against the foreign manufacturer. such was the
political theory of business during the generation that followed the
civil war.


the supremacy of the republican party (1861-85)

=business men and republican policies.=--most of the leaders in industry
gravitated to the republican ranks. they worked in the north and the
republican party was essentially northern. it was moreover--at least so
far as the majority of its members were concerned--committed to
protective tariffs, a sound monetary and banking system, the promotion
of railways and industry by land grants, and the development of internal
improvements. it was furthermore generous in its immigration policy. it
proclaimed america to be an asylum for the oppressed of all countries
and flung wide the doors for immigrants eager to fill the factories, man
the mines, and settle upon western lands. in a word the republicans
stood for all those specific measures which favored the enlargement and
prosperity of business. at the same time they resisted government
interference with private enterprise. they did not regulate railway
rates, prosecute trusts for forming combinations, or prevent railway
companies from giving lower rates to some shippers than to others. to
sum it up, the political theories of the republican party for three
decades after the civil war were the theories of american
business--prosperous and profitable industries for the owners and "the
full dinner pail" for the workmen. naturally a large portion of those
who flourished under its policies gave their support to it, voted for
its candidates, and subscribed to its campaign funds.

=sources of republican strength in the north.=--the republican party was
in fact a political organization of singular power. it originated in a
wave of moral enthusiasm, having attracted to itself, if not the
abolitionists, certainly all those idealists, like james russell lowell
and george william curtis, who had opposed slavery when opposition was
neither safe nor popular. to moral principles it added practical
considerations. business men had confidence in it. workingmen, who
longed for the independence of the farmer, owed to its indulgent land
policy the opportunity of securing free homesteads in the west. the
immigrant, landing penniless on these shores, as a result of the same
beneficent system, often found himself in a little while with an estate
as large as many a baronial domain in the old world. under a republican
administration, the union had been saved. to it the veterans of the war
could turn with confidence for those rewards of service which the
government could bestow: pensions surpassing in liberality anything that
the world had ever seen. under a republican administration also the
great debt had been created in the defense of the union, and to the
republican party every investor in government bonds could look for the
full and honorable discharge of the interest and principal. the spoils
system, inaugurated by jacksonian democracy, in turn placed all the
federal offices in republican hands, furnishing an army of party workers
to be counted on for loyal service in every campaign.

of all these things republican leaders made full and vigorous use,
sometimes ascribing to the party, in accordance with ancient political
usage, merits and achievements not wholly its own. particularly was this
true in the case of saving the union. "when in the economy of
providence, this land was to be purged of human slavery ... the
republican party came into power," ran a declaration in one platform.
"the republican party suppressed a gigantic rebellion, emancipated four
million slaves, decreed the equal citizenship of all, and established
universal suffrage," ran another. as for the aid rendered by the
millions of northern democrats who stood by the union and the tens of
thousands of them who actually fought in the union army, the republicans
in their zeal were inclined to be oblivious. they repeatedly charged the
democratic party "with being the same in character and spirit as when it
sympathized with treason."

=republican control of the south.=--to the strength enjoyed in the
north, the republicans for a long time added the advantages that came
from control over the former confederate states where the newly
enfranchised negroes, under white leadership, gave a grateful support to
the party responsible for their freedom. in this branch of politics,
motives were so mixed that no historian can hope to appraise them all at
their proper values. on the one side of the ledger must be set the
vigorous efforts of the honest and sincere friends of the freedmen to
win for them complete civil and political equality, wiping out not only
slavery but all its badges of misery and servitude. on the same side
must be placed the labor of those who had valiantly fought in forum and
field to save the union and who regarded continued republican supremacy
after the war as absolutely necessary to prevent the former leaders in
secession from coming back to power. at the same time there were
undoubtedly some men of the baser sort who looked on politics as a game
and who made use of "carpet-bagging" in the south to win the spoils that
might result from it. at all events, both by laws and presidential acts,
the republicans for many years kept a keen eye upon the maintenance of
their dominion in the south. their declaration that neither the law nor
its administration should admit any discrimination in respect of
citizens by reason of race, color, or previous condition of servitude
appealed to idealists and brought results in elections. even south
carolina, where reposed the ashes of john c. calhoun, went republican in
1872 by a vote of three to one!

republican control was made easy by the force bills described in a
previous chapter--measures which vested the supervision of elections in
federal officers appointed by republican presidents. these drastic
measures, departing from american tradition, the republican authors
urged, were necessary to safeguard the purity of the ballot, not merely
in the south where the timid freedman might readily be frightened from
using it; but also in the north, particularly in new york city, where it
was claimed that fraud was regularly practiced by democratic leaders.

the democrats, on their side, indignantly denied the charges, replying
that the force bills were nothing but devices created by the republicans
for the purpose of securing their continued rule through systematic
interference with elections. even the measures of reconstruction were
deemed by democratic leaders as thinly veiled schemes to establish
republican power throughout the country. "nor is there the slightest
doubt," exclaimed samuel j. tilden, spokesman of the democrats in new
york and candidate for president in 1876, "that the paramount object and
motive of the republican party is by these means to secure itself
against a reaction of opinion adverse to it in our great populous
northern commonwealths.... when the republican party resolved to
establish negro supremacy in the ten states in order to gain to itself
the representation of those states in congress, it had to begin by
governing the people of those states by the sword.... the next was the
creation of new electoral bodies for those ten states, in which, by
exclusions, by disfranchisements and proscriptions, by control over
registration, by applying test oaths ... by intimidation and by every
form of influence, three million negroes are made to predominate over
four and a half million whites."

=the war as a campaign issue.=--even the repeal of force bills could not
allay the sectional feelings engendered by the war. the republicans
could not forgive the men who had so recently been in arms against the
union and insisted on calling them "traitors" and "rebels." the
southerners, smarting under the reconstruction acts, could regard the
republicans only as political oppressors. the passions of the war had
been too strong; the distress too deep to be soon forgotten. the
generation that went through it all remembered it all. for twenty
years, the republicans, in their speeches and platforms, made "a
straight appeal to the patriotism of the northern voters." they
maintained that their party, which had saved the union and emancipated
the slaves, was alone worthy of protecting the union and uplifting the
freedmen.

though the democrats, especially in the north, resented this policy and
dubbed it with the expressive but inelegant phrase, "waving the bloody
shirt," the republicans refused to surrender a slogan which made such a
ready popular appeal. as late as 1884, a leader expressed the hope that
they might "wring one more president from the bloody shirt." they
refused to let the country forget that the democratic candidate, grover
cleveland, had escaped military service by hiring a substitute; and they
made political capital out of the fact that he had "insulted the
veterans of the grand army of the republic" by going fishing on
decoration day.

=three republican presidents.=--fortified by all these elements of
strength, the republicans held the presidency from 1869 to 1885. the
three presidents elected in this period, grant, hayes, and garfield, had
certain striking characteristics in common. they were all of origin
humble enough to please the most exacting jacksonian democrat. they had
been generals in the union army. grant, next to lincoln, was regarded as
the savior of the constitution. hayes and garfield, though lesser lights
in the military firmament, had honorable records duly appreciated by
veterans of the war, now thoroughly organized into the grand army of the
republic. it is true that grant was not a politician and had never voted
the republican ticket; but this was readily overlooked. hayes and
garfield on the other hand were loyal party men. the former had served
in congress and for three terms as governor of his state. the latter had
long been a member of the house of representatives and was senator-elect
when he received the nomination for president.

all of them possessed, moreover, another important asset, which was not
forgotten by the astute managers who led in selecting candidates. all
of them were from ohio--though grant had been in illinois when the
summons to military duties came--and ohio was a strategic state. it lay
between the manufacturing east and the agrarian country to the west.
having growing industries and wool to sell it benefited from the
protective tariff. yet being mainly agricultural still, it was not

without sympathy for the farmers who showed low tariff or free trade
tendencies. whatever share the east had in shaping laws and framing
policies, it was clear that the west was to have the candidates. this
division in privileges--not uncommon in political management--was always
accompanied by a judicious selection of the candidate for vice
president. with garfield, for example, was associated a prominent new
york politician, chester a. arthur, who, as fate decreed, was destined
to more than three years' service as chief magistrate, on the
assassination of his superior in office.

=the disputed election of 1876.=--while taking note of the long years of
republican supremacy, it must be recorded that grave doubts exist in the
minds of many historians as to whether one of the three presidents,
hayes, was actually the victor in 1876 or not. his democratic opponent,
samuel j. tilden, received a popular plurality of a quarter of a million
and had a plausible claim to a majority of the electoral vote. at all
events, four states sent in double returns, one set for tilden and
another for hayes; and a deadlock ensued. both parties vehemently
claimed the election and the passions ran so high that sober men did not
shrink from speaking of civil war again. fortunately, in the end, the
counsels of peace prevailed. congress provided for an electoral
commission of fifteen men to review the contested returns. the
democrats, inspired by tilden's moderation, accepted the judgment in
favor of hayes even though they were not convinced that he was really
entitled to the office.


the growth of opposition to republican rule

=abuses in american political life.=--during their long tenure of
office, the republicans could not escape the inevitable consequences of
power; that is, evil practices and corrupt conduct on the part of some
who found shelter within the party. for that matter neither did the
democrats manage to avoid such difficulties in those states and cities
where they had the majority. in new york city, for instance, the local
democratic organization, known as tammany hall, passed under the sway of
a group of politicians headed by "boss" tweed. he plundered the city
treasury until public-spirited citizens, supported by samuel j. tilden,
the democratic leader of the state, rose in revolt, drove the ringleader
from power, and sent him to jail. in philadelphia, the local republican
bosses were guilty of offenses as odious as those committed by new york
politicians. indeed, the decade that followed the civil war was marred
by so many scandals in public life that one acute editor was moved to
inquire: "are not all the great communities of the western world growing
more corrupt as they grow in wealth?"

in the sphere of national politics, where the opportunities were
greater, betrayals of public trust were even more flagrant. one
revelation after another showed officers, high and low, possessed with
the spirit of peculation. members of congress, it was found, accepted
railway stock in exchange for votes in favor of land grants and other
concessions to the companies. in the administration as well as the
legislature the disease was rife. revenue officers permitted whisky
distillers to evade their taxes and received heavy bribes in return. a
probe into the post-office department revealed the malodorous "star
route frauds"--the deliberate overpayment of certain mail carriers whose
lines were indicated in the official record by asterisks or stars. even
cabinet officers did not escape suspicion, for the trail of the serpent
led straight to the door of one of them.

in the lower ranges of official life, the spoils system became more
virulent as the number of federal employees increased. the holders of
offices and the seekers after them constituted a veritable political
army. they crowded into republican councils, for the republicans, being
in power, could alone dispense federal favors. they filled positions in
the party ranging from the lowest township committee to the national
convention. they helped to nominate candidates and draft platforms and
elbowed to one side the busy citizen, not conversant with party
intrigues, who could only give an occasional day to political matters.
even the civil service act of 1883, wrung from a reluctant congress two
years after the assassination of garfield, made little change for a long
time. it took away from the spoilsmen a few thousand government
positions, but it formed no check on the practice of rewarding party
workers from the public treasury.

on viewing this state of affairs, many a distinguished citizen became
profoundly discouraged. james russell lowell, for example, thought he
saw a steady decline in public morals. in 1865, hearing of lee's
surrender, he had exclaimed: "there is something magnificent in having a
country to love!" ten years later, when asked to write an ode for the
centennial at philadelphia in 1876, he could think only of a biting
satire on the nation:

    "show your state legislatures; show your rings;
     and challenge europe to produce such things
     as high officials sitting half in sight
     to share the plunder and fix things right.
     if that don't fetch her, why, you need only
     to show your latest style in martyrs,--tweed:
     she'll find it hard to hide her spiteful tears
     at such advance in one poor hundred years."

when his critics condemned him for this "attack upon his native land,"
lowell replied in sadness: "these fellows have no notion of what love of
country means. it was in my very blood and bones. if i am not an
american who ever was?... what fills me with doubt and dismay is the
degradation of the moral tone. is it or is it not a result of democracy?
is ours a 'government of the people, by the people, for the people,' or
a kakistocracy [a government of the worst], rather for the benefit of
knaves at the cost of fools?"

=the reform movement in republican ranks.=--the sentiments expressed by
lowell, himself a republican and for a time american ambassador to
england, were shared by many men in his party. very soon after the close
of the civil war some of them began to protest vigorously against the
policies and conduct of their leaders. in 1872, the dissenters, calling
themselves liberal republicans, broke away altogether, nominated a
candidate of their own, horace greeley, and put forward a platform
indicting the republican president fiercely enough to please the most
uncompromising democrat. they accused grant of using "the powers and
opportunities of his high office for the promotion of personal ends."
they charged him with retaining "notoriously corrupt and unworthy men in
places of power and responsibility." they alleged that the republican
party kept "alive the passions and resentments of the late civil war to
use them for their own advantages," and employed the "public service of
the government as a machinery of corruption and personal influence."

it was not apparent, however, from the ensuing election that any
considerable number of republicans accepted the views of the liberals.
greeley, though indorsed by the democrats, was utterly routed and died
of a broken heart. the lesson of his discomfiture seemed to be that
independent action was futile. so, at least, it was regarded by most men
of the rising generation like henry cabot lodge, of massachusetts, and
theodore roosevelt, of new york. profiting by the experience of greeley
they insisted in season and out that reformers who desired to rid the
party of abuses should remain loyal to it and do their work "on the
inside."

=the mugwumps and cleveland democracy in 1884.=--though aided by
republican dissensions, the democrats were slow in making headway
against the political current. they were deprived of the energetic and
capable leadership once afforded by the planters, like calhoun, davis,
and toombs; they were saddled by their opponents with responsibility for
secession; and they were stripped of the support of the prostrate
south. not until the last southern state was restored to the union, not
until a general amnesty was wrung from congress, not until white
supremacy was established at the polls, and the last federal soldier
withdrawn from southern capitals did they succeed in capturing the
presidency.

the opportune moment for them came in 1884 when a number of
circumstances favored their aspirations. the republicans, leaving the
ohio valley in their search for a candidate, nominated james g. blaine
of maine, a vigorous and popular leader but a man under fire from the
reformers in his own party. the democrats on their side were able to
find at this juncture an able candidate who had no political enemies in
the sphere of national politics, grover cleveland, then governor of new
york and widely celebrated as a man of "sterling honesty." at the same
time a number of dissatisfied republicans openly espoused the democratic
cause,--among them carl schurz, george william curtis, henry ward
beecher, and william everett, men of fine ideals and undoubted
integrity. though the "regular" republicans called them "mugwumps" and
laughed at them as the "men milliners, the dilettanti, and carpet
knights of politics," they had a following that was not to be despised.

the campaign which took place that year was one of the most savage in
american history. issues were thrust into the background. the tariff,
though mentioned, was not taken seriously. abuse of the opposition was
the favorite resource of party orators. the democrats insisted that "the
republican party so far as principle is concerned is a reminiscence. in
practice it is an organization for enriching those who control its
machinery." for the republican candidate, blaine, they could hardly find
words to express their contempt. the republicans retaliated in kind.
they praised their own good works, as of old, in saving the union, and
denounced the "fraud and violence practiced by the democracy in the
southern states." seeing little objectionable in the public record of
cleveland as mayor of buffalo and governor of new york, they attacked
his personal character. perhaps never in the history of political
campaigns did the discussions on the platform and in the press sink to
so low a level. decent people were sickened. even hot partisans shrank
from their own words when, after the election, they had time to reflect
on their heedless passions. moreover, nothing was decided by the
balloting. cleveland was elected, but his victory was a narrow one. a
change of a few hundred votes in new york would have sent his opponent
to the white house instead.

=changing political fortunes (1888-96).=--after the democrats had
settled down to the enjoyment of their hard-earned victory, president
cleveland in his message of 1887 attacked the tariff as "vicious,
inequitable, and illogical"; as a system of taxation that laid a burden
upon "every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturers."
business enterprise was thoroughly alarmed. the republicans
characterized the tariff message as a free-trade assault upon the
industries of the country. mainly on that issue they elected in 1888
benjamin harrison of indiana, a shrewd lawyer, a reticent politician, a
descendant of the hero of tippecanoe, and a son of the old northwest.
accepting the outcome of the election as a vindication of their
principles, the republicans, under the leadership of william mckinley in
the house of representatives, enacted in 1890 a tariff law imposing the
highest duties yet laid in our history. to their utter surprise,
however, they were instantly informed by the country that their program
was not approved. that very autumn they lost in the congressional
elections, and two years later they were decisively beaten in the
presidential campaign, cleveland once more leading his party to victory.

chapter xviii

the development of the great west


at the close of the civil war, kansas and texas were sentinel states on
the middle border. beyond the rockies, california, oregon, and nevada
stood guard, the last of them having been just admitted to furnish
another vote for the fifteenth amendment abolishing slavery. between the
near and far frontiers lay a vast reach of plain, desert, plateau, and
mountain, almost wholly undeveloped. a broad domain, extending from
canada to mexico, and embracing the regions now included in washington,
idaho, wyoming, montana, utah, arizona, new mexico, the dakotas, and
oklahoma, had fewer than half a million inhabitants. it was laid out
into territories, each administered under a governor appointed by the
president and senate and, as soon as there was the requisite number of
inhabitants, a legislature elected by the voters. no railway line
stretched across the desert. st. joseph on the missouri was the terminus
of the eastern lines. it required twenty-five days for a passenger to
make the overland journey to california by the stagecoach system,
established in 1858, and more than ten days for the swift pony express,
organized in 1860, to carry a letter to san francisco. indians still
roamed the plain and desert and more than one powerful tribe disputed
the white man's title to the soil.


the railways as trail blazers

=opening railways to the pacific.=--a decade before the civil war the
importance of rail connection between the east and the pacific coast had
been recognized. pressure had already been brought to bear on congress
to authorize the construction of a line and to grant land and money in
its aid. both the democrats and republicans approved the idea, but it
was involved in the slavery controversy. indeed it was submerged in it.
southern statesmen wanted connections between the gulf and the pacific
through texas, while northerners stood out for a central route.

the north had its way during the war. congress, by legislation initiated
in 1862, provided for the immediate organization of companies to build a
line from the missouri river to california and made grants of land and
loans of money to aid in the enterprise. the western end, the central
pacific, was laid out under the supervision of leland stanford. it was
heavily financed by the mormons of utah and also by the state
government, the ranchmen, miners, and business men of california; and it
was built principally by chinese labor. the eastern end, the union
pacific, starting at omaha, was constructed mainly by veterans of the
civil war and immigrants from ireland and germany. in 1869 the two
companies met near ogden in utah and the driving of the last spike,
uniting the atlantic and the pacific, was the occasion of a great
demonstration.

other lines to the pacific were projected at the same time; but the
panic of 1873 checked railway enterprise for a while. with the revival
of prosperity at the end of that decade, construction was renewed with
vigor and the year 1883 marked a series of railway triumphs. in february
trains were running from new orleans through houston, san antonio, and
yuma to san francisco, as a result of a union of the texas pacific with
the southern pacific and its subsidiary corporations. in september the
last spike was driven in the northern pacific at helena, montana. lake
superior was connected with puget sound. the waters explored by joliet
and marquette were joined to the waters plowed by sir francis drake
while he was searching for a route around the world. that same year also
a third line was opened to the pacific by way of the atchison, topeka
and santa fe, making connections through albuquerque and needles with
san francisco. the fondest hopes of railway promoters seemed to be
realized.

[illustration: united states in 1870]

=western railways precede settlement.=--in the old world and on our
atlantic seaboard, railways followed population and markets. in the far
west, railways usually preceded the people. railway builders planned
cities on paper before they laid tracks connecting them. they sent
missionaries to spread the gospel of "western opportunity" to people in
the middle west, in the eastern cities, and in southern states. then
they carried their enthusiastic converts bag and baggage in long trains
to the distant dakotas and still farther afield. so the development of
the far west was not left to the tedious processes of time. it was
pushed by men of imagination--adventurers who made a romance of
money-making and who had dreams of empire unequaled by many kings of the
past.

these empire builders bought railway lands in huge tracts; they got more
from the government; they overcame every obstacle of canon, mountain,
and stream with the aid of science; they built cities according to the
plans made by the engineers. having the towns ready and railway and
steamboat connections formed with the rest of the world, they carried
out the people to use the railways, the steamships, the houses, and the
land. it was in this way that "the frontier speculator paved the way for
the frontier agriculturalist who had to be near a market before he could
farm." the spirit of this imaginative enterprise, which laid out
railways and towns in advance of the people, is seen in an advertisement
of that day: "this extension will run 42 miles from york, northeast
through the island lake country, and will have five good north dakota
towns. the stations on the line will be well equipped with elevators and
will be constructed and ready for operation at the commencement of the
grain season. prospective merchants have been active in securing
desirable locations at the different towns on the line. there are still
opportunities for hotels, general merchandise, hardware, furniture, and
drug stores, etc."

[illustration: _copyright by underwood and underwood, n.y._

a town on the prairie]

among the railway promoters and builders in the west, james j. hill,
of the great northern and allied lines, was one of the most forceful
figures. he knew that tracks and trains were useless without passengers
and freight; without a population of farmers and town dwellers. he
therefore organized publicity in the virginias, iowa, ohio, indiana,
illinois, wisconsin, and nebraska especially. he sent out agents to tell
the story of western opportunity in this vein: "you see your children
come out of school with no chance to get farms of their own because the
cost of land in your older part of the country is so high that you can't
afford to buy land to start your sons out in life around you. they have
to go to the cities to make a living or become laborers in the mills or
hire out as farm hands. there is no future for them there. if you are
doing well where you are and can safeguard the future of your children
and see them prosper around you, don't leave here. but if you want
independence, if you are renting your land, if the money-lender is
carrying you along and you are running behind year after year, you can
do no worse by moving.... you farmers talk of free trade and protection
and what this or that political party will do for you. why don't you
vote a homestead for yourself? that is the only thing uncle sam will
ever give you. jim hill hasn't an acre of land to sell you. we are not
in the real estate business. we don't want you to go out west and make a
failure of it because the rates at which we haul you and your goods make
the first transaction a loss.... we must have landless men for a manless
land."

unlike steamship companies stimulating immigration to get the fares,
hill was seeking permanent settlers who would produce, manufacture, and
use the railways as the means of exchange. consequently he fixed low
rates and let his passengers take a good deal of live stock and
household furniture free. by doing this he made an appeal that was
answered by eager families. in 1894 the vanguard of home seekers left
indiana in fourteen passenger coaches, filled with men, women, and
children, and forty-eight freight cars carrying their household goods
and live stock. in the ten years that followed, 100,000 people from the
middle west and the south, responding to his call, went to the western
country where they brought eight million acres of prairie land under
cultivation.

when hill got his people on the land, he took an interest in everything
that increased the productivity of their labor. was the output of food
for his freight cars limited by bad drainage on the farms? hill then
interested himself in practical ways of ditching and tiling. were
farmers hampered in hauling their goods to his trains by bad roads? in
that case, he urged upon the states the improvement of highways. did the
traffic slacken because the food shipped was not of the best quality?
then live stock must be improved and scientific farming promoted. did
the farmers need credit? banks must be established close at hand to
advance it. in all conferences on scientific farm management,
conservation of natural resources, banking and credit in relation to
agriculture and industry, hill was an active participant. his was the
long vision, seeing in conservation and permanent improvements the
foundation of prosperity for the railways and the people.

indeed, he neglected no opportunity to increase the traffic on the
lines. he wanted no empty cars running in either direction and no wheat
stored in warehouses for the lack of markets. so he looked to the orient
as well as to europe as an outlet for the surplus of the farms. he sent
agents to china and japan to discover what american goods and produce
those countries would consume and what manufactures they had to offer to
americans in exchange. to open the pacific trade he bought two ocean
monsters, the _minnesota_ and the _dakota_, thus preparing for
emergencies west as well as east. when some japanese came to the united
states on their way to europe to buy steel rails, hill showed them how
easy it was for them to make their purchase in this country and ship by
way of american railways and american vessels. so the railway builder
and promoter, who helped to break the virgin soil of the prairies, lived
through the pioneer epoch and into the age of great finance. before he
died he saw the wheat fields of north dakota linked with the spinning
jennies of manchester and the docks of yokohama.


the evolution of grazing and agriculture

=the removal of the indians.=--unlike the frontier of new england in
colonial days or that of kentucky later, the advancing lines of home
builders in the far west had little difficulty with warlike natives.
indian attacks were made on the railway construction gangs; general
custer had his fatal battle with the sioux in 1876 and there were minor
brushes; but they were all of relatively slight consequence. the former
practice of treating with the indians as independent nations was
abandoned in 1871 and most of them were concentrated in reservations
where they were mainly supported by the government. the supervision of
their affairs was vested in a board of commissioners created in 1869 and
instructed to treat them as wards of the nation--a trust which
unfortunately was often betrayed. a further step in indian policy was
taken in 1887 when provision was made for issuing lands to individual
indians, thus permitting them to become citizens and settle down among
their white neighbors as farmers or cattle raisers. the disappearance of
the buffalo, the main food supply of the wild indians, had made them
more tractable and more willing to surrender the freedom of the hunter
for the routine of the reservation, ranch, or wheat field.

=the cowboy and cattle ranger.=--between the frontier of farms and the
mountains were plains and semi-arid regions in vast reaches suitable for
grazing. as soon as the railways were open into the missouri valley,
affording an outlet for stock, there sprang up to the westward cattle
and sheep raising on an immense scale. the far-famed american cowboy was
the hero in this scene. great herds of cattle were bred in texas; with
the advancing spring and summer seasons, they were driven northward
across the plains and over the buffalo trails. in a single year, 1884,
it is estimated that nearly one million head of cattle were moved out of
texas to the north by four thousand cowboys, supplied with 30,000
horses and ponies.

during the two decades from 1870 to 1890 both the cattle men and the
sheep raisers had an almost free run of the plains, using public lands
without paying for the privilege and waging war on one another over the
possession of ranges. at length, however, both had to go, as the
homesteaders and land companies came and fenced in the plain and desert
with endless lines of barbed wire. already in 1893 a writer familiar
with the frontier lamented the passing of the picturesque days: "the
unique position of the cowboys among the americans is jeopardized in a
thousand ways. towns are growing up on their pasture lands; irrigation
schemes of a dozen sorts threaten to turn bunch-grass scenery into
farm-land views; farmers are pre-empting valleys and the sides of
waterways; and the day is not far distant when stock-raising must be
done mainly in small herds, with winter corrals, and then the cowboy's
days will end. even now his condition disappoints those who knew him
only half a dozen years ago. his breed seems to have deteriorated and
his ranks are filling with men who work for wages rather than for the
love of the free life and bold companionship that once tempted men into
that calling. splendid cheyenne saddles are less and less numerous in
the outfits; the distinctive hat that made its way up from mexico may or
may not be worn; all the civil authorities in nearly all towns in the
grazing country forbid the wearing of side arms; nobody shoots up these
towns any more. the fact is the old simon-pure cowboy days are gone
already."

=settlement under the homestead act of 1862.=--two factors gave a
special stimulus to the rapid settlement of western lands which swept
away the indians and the cattle rangers. the first was the policy of the
railway companies in selling large blocks of land received from the
government at low prices to induce immigration. the second was the
operation of the homestead law passed in 1862. this measure practically
closed the long controversy over the disposition of the public domain
that was suitable for agriculture. it provided for granting, without any
cost save a small registration fee, public lands in lots of 160 acres
each to citizens and aliens who declared their intention of becoming
citizens. the one important condition attached was that the settler
should occupy the farm for five years before his title was finally
confirmed. even this stipulation was waived in the case of the civil war
veterans who were allowed to count their term of military service as a
part of the five years' occupancy required. as the soldiers of the
revolutionary and mexican wars had advanced in great numbers to the
frontier in earlier days, so now veterans led in the settlement of the
middle border. along with them went thousands of german, irish, and
scandinavian immigrants, fresh from the old world. between 1867 and
1874, 27,000,000 acres were staked out in quarter-section farms. in
twenty years (1860-80), the population of nebraska leaped from 28,000 to
almost half a million; kansas from 100,000 to a million; iowa from
600,000 to 1,600,000; and the dakotas from 5000 to 140,000.

=the diversity of western agriculture.=--in soil, produce, and
management, western agriculture presented many contrasts to that of the
east and south. in the region of arable and watered lands the typical
american unit--the small farm tilled by the owner--appeared as usual;
but by the side of it many a huge domain owned by foreign or eastern
companies and tilled by hired labor. sometimes the great estate took the
shape of the "bonanza farm" devoted mainly to wheat and corn and
cultivated on a large scale by machinery. again it assumed the form of
the cattle ranch embracing tens of thousands of acres. again it was a
vast holding of diversified interest, such as the santa anita ranch near
los angeles, a domain of 60,000 acres "cultivated in a glorious sweep of
vineyards and orange and olive orchards, rich sheep and cattle pastures
and horse ranches, their life and customs handed down from the spanish
owners of the various ranches which were swept into one estate."

=irrigation.=--in one respect agriculture in the far west was unique. in
a large area spreading through eight states, montana, idaho, wyoming,
utah, colorado, nevada, arizona, new mexico, and parts of adjoining
states, the rainfall was so slight that the ordinary crops to which the
american farmer was accustomed could not be grown at all. the mormons
were the first anglo-saxons to encounter aridity, and they were baffled
at first; but they studied it and mastered it by magnificent irrigation
systems. as other settlers poured into the west the problem of the
desert was attacked with a will, some of them replying to the
commiseration of eastern farmers by saying that it was easier to scoop
out an irrigation ditch than to cut forests and wrestle with stumps and
stones. private companies bought immense areas at low prices, built
irrigation works, and disposed of their lands in small plots. some
ranchers with an instinct for water, like that of the miner for metal,
sank wells into the dry sand and were rewarded with gushers that "soused
the thirsty desert and turned its good-for-nothing sand into
good-for-anything loam." the federal government came to the aid of the
arid regions in 1894 by granting lands to the states to be used for
irrigation purposes. in this work wyoming took the lead with a law which
induced capitalists to invest in irrigation and at the same time
provided for the sale of the redeemed lands to actual settlers. finally
in 1902 the federal government by its liberal reclamation act added its
strength to that of individuals, companies, and states in conquering
"arid america."

"nowhere," writes powell, a historian of the west, in his picturesque
_end of the trail_, "has the white man fought a more courageous fight or
won a more brilliant victory than in arizona. his weapons have been the
transit and the level, the drill and the dredge, the pick and the spade;
and the enemy which he has conquered has been the most stubborn of all
foes--the hostile forces of nature.... the story of how the white man
within the space of less than thirty years penetrated, explored, and
mapped this almost unknown region; of how he carried law, order, and
justice into a section which had never had so much as a speaking
acquaintance with any one of the three before; of how, realizing the
necessity for means of communication, he built highways of steel across
this territory from east to west and from north to south; of how,
undismayed by the savageness of the countenance which the desert turned
upon him, he laughed and rolled up his sleeves, and spat upon his hands,
and slashed the face of the desert with canals and irrigating ditches,
and filled those ditches with water brought from deep in the earth or
high in the mountains; and of how, in the conquered and submissive soil,
he replaced the aloe with alfalfa, the mesquite with maize, the cactus
with cotton, forms one of the most inspiring chapters in our history. it
is one of the epics of civilization, this reclamation of the southwest,
and its heroes, thank god, are americans.

"other desert regions have been redeemed by irrigation--egypt, for
example, and mesopotamia and parts of the sudan--but the people of all
those regions lay stretched out in the shade of a convenient palm,
metaphorically speaking, and waited for some one with more energy than
themselves to come along and do the work. but the arizonians, mindful of
the fact that god, the government, and carnegie help those who help
themselves, spent their days wielding the pick and shovel, and their
evenings in writing letters to washington with toil-hardened hands.
after a time the government was prodded into action and the great dams
at laguna and roosevelt are the result. then the people, organizing
themselves into cooperative leagues and water-users' associations, took
up the work of reclamation where the government left off; it is to these
energetic, persevering men who have drilled wells, plowed fields, and
dug ditches through the length and breadth of that great region which
stretches from yuma to tucson, that the metamorphosis of arizona is
due."

the effect of irrigation wherever introduced was amazing. stretches of
sand and sagebrush gave way to fertile fields bearing crops of wheat,
corn, fruits, vegetables, and grass. huge ranches grazed by browsing
sheep were broken up into small plots. the cowboy and ranchman vanished.
in their place rose the prosperous community--a community unlike the
township of iowa or the industrial center of the east. its intensive
tillage left little room for hired labor. its small holdings drew
families together in village life rather than dispersing them on the
lonely plain. often the development of water power in connection with
irrigation afforded electricity for labor-saving devices and lifted many
a burden that in other days fell heavily upon the shoulders of the
farmer and his family.


mining and manufacturing in the west

=mineral resources.=--in another important particular the far west
differed from the mississippi valley states. that was in the
predominance of mining over agriculture throughout a vast section.
indeed it was the minerals rather than the land that attracted the
pioneers who first opened the country. the discovery of gold in
california in 1848 was the signal for the great rush of prospectors,
miners, and promoters who explored the valleys, climbed the hills,
washed the sands, and dug up the soil in their feverish search for gold,
silver, copper, coal, and other minerals. in nevada and montana the
development of mineral resources went on all during the civil war. alder
gulch became virginia city in 1863; last chance gulch was named helena
in 1864; and confederate gulch was christened diamond city in 1865. at
butte the miners began operations in 1864 and within five years had
washed out eight million dollars' worth of gold. under the gold they
found silver; under silver they found copper.

even at the end of the nineteenth century, after agriculture was well
advanced and stock and sheep raising introduced on a large scale,
minerals continued to be the chief source of wealth in a number of
states. this was revealed by the figures for 1910. the gold, silver,
iron, and copper of colorado were worth more than the wheat, corn, and
oats combined; the copper of montana sold for more than all the cereals
and four times the price of the wheat. the interest of nevada was also
mainly mining, the receipts from the mineral output being $43,000,000 or
more than one-half the national debt of hamilton's day. the yield of the
mines of utah was worth four or five times the wheat crop; the coal of
wyoming brought twice as much as the great wool clip; the minerals of
arizona were totaled at $43,000,000 as against a wool clip reckoned at
$1,200,000; while in idaho alone of this group of states did the wheat
crop exceed in value the output of the mines.

logging]

=timber resources.=--the forests of the great west, unlike those of the
ohio valley, proved a boon to the pioneers rather than a foe to be
attacked. in ohio and indiana, for example, the frontier line of
homemakers had to cut, roll, and burn thousands of trees before they
could put out a crop of any size. beyond the mississippi, however,
there were all ready for the breaking plow great reaches of almost
treeless prairie, where every stick of timber was precious. in the other
parts, often rough and mountainous, where stood primeval forests of the
finest woods, the railroads made good use of the timber. they consumed
acres of forests themselves in making ties, bridge timbers, and
telegraph poles, and they laid a heavy tribute upon the forests for
their annual upkeep. the surplus trees, such as had burdened the
pioneers of the northwest territory a hundred years before, they carried
off to markets on the east and west coasts.

=western industries.=--the peculiar conditions of the far west
stimulated a rise of industries more rapid than is usual in new country.
the mining activities which in many sections preceded agriculture called
for sawmills to furnish timber for the mines and smelters to reduce and
refine ores. the ranches supplied sheep and cattle for the packing
houses of kansas city as well as chicago. the waters of the northwest
afforded salmon for 4000 cases in 1866 and for 1,400,000 cases in 1916.
the fruits and vegetables of california brought into existence
innumerable canneries. the lumber industry, starting with crude sawmills
to furnish rough timbers for railways and mines, ended in specialized
factories for paper, boxes, and furniture. as the railways preceded
settlement and furnished a ready outlet for local manufactures, so they
encouraged the early establishment of varied industries, thus creating a
state of affairs quite unlike that which obtained in the ohio valley in
the early days before the opening of the erie canal.

=social effects of economic activities.=--in many respects the social
life of the far west also differed from that of the ohio valley. the
treeless prairies, though open to homesteads, favored the great estate
tilled in part by tenant labor and in part by migratory seasonal labor,
summoned from all sections of the country for the harvests. the mineral
resources created hundreds of huge fortunes which made the accumulations
of eastern mercantile families look trivial by comparison. other
millionaires won their fortunes in the railway business and still more
from the cattle and sheep ranges. in many sections the "cattle king," as
he was called, was as dominant as the planter had been in the old south.
everywhere in the grazing country he was a conspicuous and important
person. he "sometimes invested money in banks, in railroad stocks, or in
city property.... he had his rating in the commercial reviews and could
hobnob with bankers, railroad presidents, and metropolitan merchants....
he attended party caucuses and conventions, ran for the state
legislature, and sometimes defeated a lawyer or metropolitan 'business
man' in the race for a seat in congress. in proportion to their numbers,
the ranchers ... have constituted a highly impressive class."

although many of the early capitalists of the great west, especially
from nevada, spent their money principally in the east, others took
leadership in promoting the sections in which they had made their
fortunes. a railroad pioneer, general palmer, built his home at colorado
springs, founded the town, and encouraged local improvements. denver
owed its first impressive buildings to the civic patriotism of horace
tabor, a wealthy mine owner. leland stanford paid his tribute to
california in the endowment of a large university. colonel w.f. cody,
better known as "buffalo bill," started his career by building a "boom
town" which collapsed, and made a large sum of money supplying buffalo
meat to construction hands (hence his popular name). by his famous wild
west show, he increased it to a fortune which he devoted mainly to the
promotion of a western reclamation scheme.

while the far west was developing this vigorous, aggressive leadership
in business, a considerable industrial population was springing up. even
the cattle ranges and hundreds of farms were conducted like factories in
that they were managed through overseers who hired plowmen, harvesters,
and cattlemen at regular wages. at the same time there appeared other
peculiar features which made a lasting impression on western economic
life. mining, lumbering, and fruit growing, for instance, employed
thousands of workers during the rush months and turned them out at other
times. the inevitable result was an army of migratory laborers wandering
from camp to camp, from town to town, and from ranch to ranch, without
fixed homes or established habits of life. from this extraordinary
condition there issued many a long and lawless conflict between capital
and labor, giving a distinct color to the labor movement in whole
sections of the mountain and coast states.


the admission of new states

=the spirit of self-government.=--the instinct of self-government was
strong in the western communities. in the very beginning, it led to the
organization of volunteer committees, known as "vigilantes," to suppress
crime and punish criminals. as soon as enough people were settled
permanently in a region, they took care to form a more stable kind of
government. an illustration of this process is found in the oregon
compact made by the pioneers in 1843, the spirit of which is reflected
in an editorial in an old copy of the _rocky mountain news_: "we claim
that any body or community of american citizens which from any cause or
under any circumstances is cut off from or from isolation is so situated
as not to be under any active and protecting branch of the central
government, have a right, if on american soil, to frame a government and
enact such laws and regulations as may be necessary for their own
safety, protection, and happiness, always with the condition precedent,
that they shall, at the earliest moment when the central government
shall extend an effective organization and laws over them, give it their
unqualified support and obedience."

people who turned so naturally to the organization of local
administration were equally eager for admission to the union as soon as
any shadow of a claim to statehood could be advanced. as long as a
region was merely one of the territories of the united states, the
appointment of the governor and other officers was controlled by
politics at washington. moreover the disposition of land, mineral
rights, forests, and water power was also in the hands of national
leaders. thus practical considerations were united with the spirit of
independence in the quest for local autonomy.

=nebraska and colorado.=--two states, nebraska and colorado, had little
difficulty in securing admission to the union. the first, nebraska, had
been organized as a territory by the famous kansas-nebraska bill which
did so much to precipitate the civil war. lying to the north of kansas,
which had been admitted in 1861, it escaped the invasion of slave owners
from missouri and was settled mainly by farmers from the north. though
it claimed a population of only 67,000, it was regarded with kindly
interest by the republican congress at washington and, reduced to its
present boundaries, it received the coveted statehood in 1867.

this was hardly accomplished before the people of colorado to the
southwest began to make known their demands. they had been organized
under territorial government in 1861 when they numbered only a handful;
but within ten years the aspect of their affairs had completely changed.
the silver and gold deposits of the leadville and cripple creek regions
had attracted an army of miners and prospectors. the city of denver,
founded in 1858 and named after the governor of kansas whence came many
of the early settlers, had grown from a straggling camp of log huts into
a prosperous center of trade. by 1875 it was reckoned that the
population of the territory was not less than one hundred thousand; the
following year congress, yielding to the popular appeal, made colorado a
member of the american union.

=six new states (1889-1890).=--for many years there was a deadlock in
congress over the admission of new states. the spell was broken in 1889
under the leadership of the dakotas. for a long time the dakota
territory, organized in 1861, had been looked upon as the home of the
powerful sioux indians whose enormous reservation blocked the advance of
the frontier. the discovery of gold in the black hills, however, marked
their doom. even before congress could open their lands to prospectors,
pioneers were swarming over the country. farmers from the adjoining
minnesota and the eastern states, scandinavians, germans, and canadians,
came in swelling waves to occupy the fertile dakota lands, now famous
even as far away as the fjords of norway. seldom had the plow of man cut
through richer soil than was found in the bottoms of the red river
valley, and it became all the more precious when the opening of the
northern pacific in 1883 afforded a means of transportation east and
west. the population, which had numbered 135,000 in 1880, passed the
half million mark before ten years had elapsed.

remembering that nebraska had been admitted with only 67,000
inhabitants, the dakotans could not see why they should be kept under
federal tutelage. at the same time washington, far away on the pacific
coast, montana, idaho, and wyoming, boasting of their populations and
their riches, put in their own eloquent pleas. but the members of
congress were busy with politics. the democrats saw no good reason for
admitting new republican states until after their defeat in 1888. near
the end of their term the next year they opened the door for north and
south dakota, washington, and montana. in 1890, a republican congress
brought idaho and wyoming into the union, the latter with woman
suffrage, which had been granted twenty-one years before.

=utah.=--although utah had long presented all the elements of a
well-settled and industrious community, its admission to the union was
delayed on account of popular hostility to the practice of polygamy. the
custom, it is true, had been prohibited by act of congress in 1862; but
the law had been systematically evaded. in 1882 congress made another
and more effective effort to stamp out polygamy. five years later it
even went so far as to authorize the confiscation of the property of the
mormon church in case the practice of plural marriages was not stopped.
meanwhile the gentile or non-mormon population was steadily increasing
and the leaders in the church became convinced that the battle
against the sentiment of the country was futile. at last in 1896 utah
was admitted as a state under a constitution which forbade plural
marriages absolutely and forever. horace greeley, who visited utah in
1859, had prophesied that the pacific railroad would work a revolution
in the land of brigham young. his prophecy had come true.

[illustration: the united states in 1912]

=rounding out the continent.=--three more territories now remained out
of the union. oklahoma, long an indian reservation, had been opened for
settlement to white men in 1889. the rush upon the fertile lands of this
region, the last in the history of america, was marked by all the frenzy
of the final, desperate chance. at a signal from a bugle an army of men
with families in wagons, men and women on horseback and on foot, burst
into the territory. during the first night a city of tents was raised at
guthrie and oklahoma city. in ten days wooden houses rose on the plains.
in a single year there were schools, churches, business blocks, and
newspapers. within fifteen years there was a population of more than
half a million. to the west, arizona with a population of about 125,000
and new mexico with 200,000 inhabitants joined oklahoma in asking for
statehood. congress, then republican, looked with reluctance upon the
addition of more democratic states; but in 1907 it was literally
compelled by public sentiment and a sense of justice to admit oklahoma.
in 1910 the house of representatives went to the democrats and within
two years arizona and new mexico were "under the roof." so the
continental domain was rounded out.


the influence of the far west on national life

=the last of the frontier.=--when horace greeley made his trip west in
1859 he thus recorded the progress of civilization in his journal:

     "may 12th, chicago.--chocolate and morning journals last
     seen on the hotel breakfast table.

     23rd, leavenworth (kansas).--room bells and bath tubs make
     their final appearance.

     26th, manhattan.--potatoes and eggs last recognized among
     the blessings that 'brighten as they take their flight.'

     27th, junction city.--last visitation of a boot-black, with
     dissolving views of a board bedroom. beds bid us good-by."

[illustration: _copyright by panama-california exposition_

exposition, san diego, 1915]

within thirty years travelers were riding across that country in pullman
cars and enjoying at the hotels all the comforts of a standardized
civilization. the "wild west" was gone, and with it that frontier of
pioneers and settlers who had long given such a bent and tone to
american life and had "poured in upon the floor of congress" such a long
line of "backwoods politicians," as they were scornfully styled.

=free land and eastern labor.=--it was not only the picturesque features
of the frontier that were gone. of far more consequence was the
disappearance of free lands with all that meant for american labor. for
more than a hundred years, any man of even moderate means had been able
to secure a homestead of his own and an independent livelihood. for a
hundred years america had been able to supply farms to as many
immigrants as cared to till the soil. every new pair of strong arms
meant more farms and more wealth. workmen in eastern factories, mines,
or mills who did not like their hours, wages, or conditions of labor,
could readily find an outlet to the land. now all that was over. by
about 1890 most of the desirable land available under the homestead act
had disappeared. american industrial workers confronted a new situation.

=grain supplants king cotton.=--in the meantime a revolution was taking
place in agriculture. until 1860 the chief staples sold by america were
cotton and tobacco. with the advance of the frontier, corn and wheat
supplanted them both in agrarian economy. the west became the granary of
the east and of western europe. the scoop shovel once used to handle
grain was superseded by the towering elevator, loading and unloading
thousands of bushels every hour. the refrigerator car and ship made the
packing industry as stable as the production of cotton or corn, and gave
an immense impetus to cattle raising and sheep farming. so the meat of
the west took its place on the english dinner table by the side of bread
baked from dakotan wheat.

=aid in american economic independence.=--the effects of this economic
movement were manifold and striking. billions of dollars' worth of
american grain, dairy produce, and meat were poured into european
markets where they paid off debts due money lenders and acquired
capital to develop american resources. thus they accelerated the
progress of american financiers toward national independence. the
country, which had timidly turned to the old world for capital in
hamilton's day and had borrowed at high rates of interest in london in
lincoln's day, moved swiftly toward the time when it would be among the
world's first bankers and money lenders itself. every grain of wheat and
corn pulled the balance down on the american side of the scale.

=eastern agriculture affected.=--in the east as well as abroad the
opening of the western granary produced momentous results. the
agricultural economy of that part of the country was changed in many
respects. whole sections of the poorest land went almost out of
cultivation, the abandoned farms of the new england hills bearing solemn
witness to the competing power of western wheat fields. sheep and cattle
raising, as well as wheat and corn production, suffered at least a
relative decline. thousands of farmers cultivating land of the lower
grade were forced to go west or were driven to the margin of
subsistence. even the herds that supplied eastern cities with milk were
fed upon grain brought halfway across the continent.

=the expansion of the american market.=--upon industry as well as
agriculture, the opening of vast food-producing regions told in a
thousand ways. the demand for farm machinery, clothing, boots, shoes,
and other manufactures gave to american industries such a market as even
hamilton had never foreseen. moreover it helped to expand far into the
mississippi valley the industrial area once confined to the northern
seaboard states and to transform the region of the great lakes into an
industrial empire. herein lies the explanation of the growth of
mid-western cities after 1865. chicago, with its thirty-five railways,
tapped every locality of the west and south. to the railways were added
the water routes of the lakes, thus creating a strategic center for
industries. long foresight carried the mccormick reaper works to
chicago before 1860. from troy, new york, went a large stove plant. that
was followed by a shoe factory from massachusetts. the packing industry
rose as a matter of course at a point so advantageous for cattle raisers
and shippers and so well connected with eastern markets.

to the opening of the far west also the lake region was indebted for a
large part of that water-borne traffic which made it "the mediterranean
basin of north america." the produce of the west and the manufactures of
the east poured through it in an endless stream. the swift growth of
shipbuilding on the great lakes helped to compensate for the decline of
the american marine on the high seas. in response to this stimulus
detroit could boast that her shipwrights were able to turn out a ten
thousand ton leviathan for ore or grain about "as quickly as carpenters
could put up an eight-room house." thus in relation to the far west the
old northwest territory--the wilderness of jefferson's time--had taken
the position formerly occupied by new england alone. it was supplying
capital and manufactures for a vast agricultural empire west and south.

=america on the pacific.=--it has been said that the mediterranean sea
was the center of ancient civilization; that modern civilization has
developed on the shores of the atlantic; and that the future belongs to
the pacific. at any rate, the sweep of the united states to the shores
of the pacific quickly exercised a powerful influence on world affairs
and it undoubtedly has a still greater significance for the future.

very early regular traffic sprang up between the pacific ports and the
hawaiian islands, china, and japan. two years before the adjustment of
the oregon controversy with england, namely in 1844, the united states
had established official and trading relations with china. ten years
later, four years after the admission of california to the union, the
barred door of japan was forced open by commodore perry. the commerce
which had long before developed between the pacific ports and hawaii,
china, and japan now flourished under official care. in 1865 a ship
from honolulu carried sugar, molasses, and fruits from hawaii to the
oregon port of astoria. the next year a vessel from hongkong brought
rice, mats, and tea from china. an era of lucrative trade was opened.
the annexation of hawaii in 1898, the addition of the philippines at the
same time, and the participation of american troops in the suppression
of the boxer rebellion in peking in 1900, were but signs and symbols of
american power on the pacific.

=conservation and the land problem.=--the disappearance of the frontier
also brought new and serious problems to the governments of the states
and the nation. the people of the whole united states suddenly were
forced to realize that there was a limit to the rich, new land to
exploit and to the forests and minerals awaiting the ax and the pick.
then arose in america the questions which had long perplexed the
countries of the old world--the scientific use of the soils and
conservation of natural resources. hitherto the government had followed
the easy path of giving away arable land and selling forest and mineral
lands at low prices. now it had to face far more difficult and complex
problems. it also had to consider questions of land tenure again,
especially if the ideal of a nation of home-owning farmers was to be
maintained. while there was plenty of land for every man or woman who
wanted a home on the soil, it made little difference if single landlords
or companies got possession of millions of acres, if a hundred men in
one western river valley owned 17,000,000 acres; but when the good land
for small homesteads was all gone, then was raised the real issue. at
the opening of the twentieth century the nation, which a hundred years
before had land and natural resources apparently without limit, was
compelled to enact law after law conserving its forests and minerals.
then it was that the great state of california, on the very border of
the continent, felt constrained to enact a land settlement measure
providing government assistance in an effort to break up large holdings
into small lots and to make it easy for actual settlers to acquire small
farms. america was passing into a new epoch.

chapter xix

domestic issues before the country (1865-1897)


for thirty years after the civil war the leading political parties,
although they engaged in heated presidential campaigns, were not sharply
and clearly opposed on many matters of vital significance. during none
of that time was there a clash of opinion over specific issues such as
rent the country in 1800 when jefferson rode a popular wave to victory,
or again in 1828 when jackson's western hordes came sweeping into power.
the democrats, who before 1860 definitely opposed protective tariffs,
federal banking, internal improvements, and heavy taxes, now spoke
cautiously on all these points. the republicans, conscious of the fact
that they had been a minority of the voters in 1860 and warned by the
early loss of the house of representatives in 1874, also moved with
considerable prudence among the perplexing problems of the day. again
and again the votes in congress showed that no clear line separated all
the democrats from all the republicans. there were republicans who
favored tariff reductions and "cheap money." there were democrats who
looked with partiality upon high protection or with indulgence upon the
contraction of the currency. only on matters relating to the coercion of
the south was the division between the parties fairly definite; this
could be readily accounted for on practical as well as sentimental
grounds.

after all, the vague criticisms and proposals that found their way into
the political platforms did but reflect the confusion of mind prevailing
in the country. the fact that, out of the eighteen years between 1875
and 1893, the democrats held the house of representatives for fourteen
years while the republicans had every president but one showed that the
voters, like the politicians, were in a state of indecision. hayes had a
democratic house during his entire term and a democratic senate for two
years of the four. cleveland was confronted by a belligerent republican
majority in the senate during his first administration; and at the same
time was supported by a democratic majority in the house. harrison was
sustained by continuous republican successes in senatorial elections;
but in the house he had the barest majority from 1889 to 1891 and lost
that altogether at the election held in the middle of his term. the
opinion of the country was evidently unsettled and fluctuating. it was
still distracted by memories of the dead past and uncertain as to the
trend of the future.


the currency question

nevertheless these years of muddled politics and nebulous issues proved
to be a period in which social forces were gathering for the great
campaign of 1896. except for three new features--the railways, the
trusts, and the trade unions--the subjects of debate among the people
were the same as those that had engaged their attention since the
foundation of the republic: the currency, the national debt, banking,
the tariff, and taxation.

=debtors and the fall in prices.=--for many reasons the currency
question occupied the center of interest. as of old, the farmers and
planters of the west and south were heavily in debt to the east for
borrowed money secured by farm mortgages; and they counted upon the sale
of cotton, corn, wheat, and hogs to meet interest and principal when
due. during the war, the western farmers had been able to dispose of
their produce at high prices and thus discharge their debts with
comparative ease; but after the war prices declined. wheat that sold at
two dollars a bushel in 1865 brought sixty-four cents twenty years
later. the meaning of this for the farmers in debt--and nearly
three-fourths of them were in that class--can be shown by a single
illustration. a thousand-dollar mortgage on a western farm could be paid
off by five hundred bushels of wheat when prices were high; whereas it
took about fifteen hundred bushels to pay the same debt when wheat was
at the bottom of the scale. for the farmer, it must be remembered, wheat
was the measure of his labor, the product of his toil under the summer
sun; and in its price he found the test of his prosperity.

=creditors and falling prices.=--to the bondholders or creditors, on the
other hand, falling prices were clear gain. if a fifty-dollar coupon on
a bond bought seventy or eighty bushels of wheat instead of twenty or
thirty, the advantage to the owner of the coupon was obvious. moreover
the advantage seemed to him entirely just. creditors had suffered heavy
losses when the civil war carried prices skyward while the interest
rates on their old bonds remained stationary. for example, if a man had
a $1000 bond issued before 1860 and paying interest at five per cent, he
received fifty dollars a year from it. before the war each dollar would
buy a bushel of wheat; in 1865 it would only buy half a bushel. when
prices--that is, the cost of living--began to go down, creditors
therefore generally regarded the change with satisfaction as a return to
normal conditions.

=the cause of falling prices.=--the fall in prices was due, no doubt, to
many factors. among them must be reckoned the discontinuance of
government buying for war purposes, labor-saving farm machinery,
immigration, and the opening of new wheat-growing regions. the currency,
too, was an element in the situation. whatever the cause, the
discontented farmers believed that the way to raise prices was to issue
more money. they viewed it as a case of supply and demand. if there was
a small volume of currency in circulation, prices would be low; if there
was a large volume, prices would be high. hence they looked with favor
upon all plans to increase the amount of money in circulation. first
they advocated more paper notes--greenbacks--and then they turned to
silver as the remedy. the creditors, on the other hand, naturally
approved the reduction of the volume of currency. they wished to see the
greenbacks withdrawn from circulation and gold--a metal more limited in
volume than silver--made the sole basis of the national monetary system.

=the battle over the greenbacks.=--the contest between these factions
began as early as 1866. in that year, congress enacted a law authorizing
the treasury to withdraw the greenbacks from circulation. the paper
money party set up a shrill cry of protest, and kept up the fight until,
in 1878, it forced congress to provide for the continuous re-issue of
the legal tender notes as they came into the treasury in payment of
taxes and other dues. then could the friends of easy money rejoice:

    "thou, greenback, 'tis of thee
     fair money of the free,
      of thee we sing."

=resumption of specie payment.=--there was, however, another side to
this victory. the opponents of the greenbacks, unable to stop the
circulation of paper, induced congress to pass a law in 1875 providing
that on and after january 1, 1879, "the secretary of the treasury shall
redeem in coin the united states legal tender notes then outstanding on
their presentation at the office of the assistant treasurer of the
united states in the city of new york in sums of not less than fifty
dollars." "the way to resume," john sherman had said, "is to resume."
when the hour for redemption arrived, the treasury was prepared with a
large hoard of gold. "on the appointed day," wrote the assistant
secretary, "anxiety reigned in the office of the treasury. hour after
hour passed; no news from new york. inquiry by wire showed that all was
quiet. at the close of the day this message came: '$135,000 of notes
presented for coin--$400,000 of gold for notes.' that was all.
resumption was accomplished with no disturbance. by five o'clock the
news was all over the land, and the new york bankers were sipping their
tea in absolute safety."

=the specie problem--the parity of gold and silver.=--defeated in their
efforts to stop "the present suicidal and destructive policy of
contraction," the advocates of an abundant currency demanded an increase
in the volume of silver in circulation. this precipitated one of the
sharpest political battles in american history. the issue turned on
legal as well as economic points. the constitution gave congress the
power to coin money and it forbade the states to make anything but gold
and silver legal tender in the payment of debts. it evidently
contemplated the use of both metals in the currency system. such, at
least, was the view of many eminent statesmen, including no less a
personage than james g. blaine. the difficulty, however, lay in
maintaining gold and silver coins on a level which would permit them to
circulate with equal facility. obviously, if the gold in a gold dollar
exceeds the value of the silver in a silver dollar on the open market,
men will hoard gold money and leave silver money in circulation. when,
for example, congress in 1792 fixed the ratio of the two metals at one
to fifteen--one ounce of gold declared worth fifteen of silver--it was
soon found that gold had been undervalued. when again in 1834 the ratio
was put at one to sixteen, it was found that silver was undervalued.
consequently the latter metal was not brought in for coinage and silver
almost dropped out of circulation. many a silver dollar was melted down
by silverware factories.

=silver demonetized in 1873.=--so things stood in 1873. at that time,
congress, in enacting a mintage law, discontinued the coinage of the
standard silver dollar, then practically out of circulation. this act
was denounced later by the friends of silver as "the crime of '73," a
conspiracy devised by the money power and secretly carried out. this
contention the debates in congress do not seem to sustain. in the course
of the argument on the mint law it was distinctly said by one speaker at
least: "this bill provides for the making of changes in the legal tender
coin of the country and for substituting as legal tender, coin of only
one metal instead of two as heretofore."

=the decline in the value of silver.=--absorbed in the greenback
controversy, the people apparently did not appreciate, at the time, the
significance of the "demonetization" of silver; but within a few years
several events united in making it the center of a political storm.
germany, having abandoned silver in 1871, steadily increased her demand
for gold. three years later, the countries of the latin union followed
this example, thus helping to enhance the price of the yellow metal. all
the while, new silver lodes, discovered in the far west, were pouring
into the market great streams of the white metal, bearing down the
price. then came the resumption of specie payment, which, in effect,
placed the paper money on a gold basis. within twenty years silver was
worth in gold only about half the price of 1870.

that there had been a real decline in silver was denied by the friends
of that metal. they alleged that gold had gone up because it had been
given a monopoly in the coinage markets of civilized governments. this
monopoly, they continued, was the fruit of a conspiracy against the
people conceived by the bankers of the world. moreover, they went on,
the placing of the greenbacks on a gold basis had itself worked a
contraction of the currency; it lowered the prices of labor and produce
to the advantage of the holders of long-term investments bearing a fixed
rate of interest. when wheat sold at sixty-four cents a bushel, their
search for relief became desperate, and they at last concentrated their
efforts on opening the mints of the government for the free coinage of
silver at the ratio of sixteen to one.

=republicans and democrats divided.=--on this question both republicans
and democrats were divided, the line being drawn between the east on the
one hand and the south and west on the other, rather than between the
two leading parties. so trusted a leader as james g. blaine avowed, in a
speech delivered in the senate in 1878, that, as the constitution
required congress to make both gold and silver the money of the land,
the only question left was that of fixing the ratio between them. he
affirmed, moreover, the main contention of the silver faction that a
reopening of the government mints of the world to silver would bring it
up to its old relation with gold. he admitted also that their most
ominous warnings were well founded, saying: "i believe the struggle now
going on in this country and in other countries for a single gold
standard would, if successful, produce widespread disaster throughout
the commercial world. the destruction of silver as money and the
establishment of gold as the sole unit of value must have a ruinous
effect on all forms of property, except those investments which yield a
fixed return."

this was exactly the concession that the silver party wanted.
"three-fourths of the business enterprises of this country are conducted
on borrowed capital," said senator jones, of nevada. "three-fourths of
the homes and farms that stand in the names of the actual occupants have
been bought on time and a very large proportion of them are mortgaged
for the payment of some part of the purchase money. under the operation
of a shrinkage in the volume of money, this enormous mass of borrowers,
at the maturity of their respective debts, though nominally paying no
more than the amount borrowed, with interest, are in reality, in the
amount of the principal alone, returning a percentage of value greater
than they received--more in equity than they contracted to pay.... in
all discussions of the subject the creditors attempt to brush aside the
equities involved by sneering at the debtors."

=the silver purchase act (1878).=--even before the actual resumption of
specie payment, the advocates of free silver were a power to be reckoned
with, particularly in the democratic party. they had a majority in the
house of representatives in 1878 and they carried a silver bill through
that chamber. blocked by the republican senate they accepted a
compromise in the bland-allison bill, which provided for huge monthly
purchases of silver by the government for coinage into dollars. so
strong was the sentiment that a two-thirds majority was mustered after
president hayes vetoed the measure.

the effect of this act, as some had anticipated, was disappointing. it
did not stay silver on its downward course. thereupon the silver faction
pressed through congress in 1886 a bill providing for the issue of paper
certificates based on the silver accumulated in the treasury. still
silver continued to fall. then the advocates of inflation declared that
they would be content with nothing short of free coinage at the ratio of
sixteen to one. if the issue had been squarely presented in 1890, there
is good reason for believing that free silver would have received a
majority in both houses of congress; but it was not presented.

=the sherman silver purchase act and the bond sales.=--republican
leaders, particularly from the east, stemmed the silver tide by a
diversion of forces. they passed the sherman act of 1890 providing for
large monthly purchases of silver and for the issue of notes redeemable
in gold or silver at the discretion of the secretary of the treasury. in
a clause of superb ambiguity they announced that it was "the established
policy of the united states to maintain the two metals on a parity with
each other upon the present legal ratio or such other ratio as may be
provided by law." for a while silver was buoyed up. then it turned once
more on its downward course. in the meantime the treasury was in a sad
plight. to maintain the gold reserve, president cleveland felt compelled
to sell government bonds; and to his dismay he found that as soon as the
gold was brought in at the front door of the treasury, notes were
presented for redemption and the gold was quickly carried out at the
back door. alarmed at the vicious circle thus created, he urged upon
congress the repeal of the sherman silver purchase act. for this he was
roundly condemned by many of his own followers who branded his conduct
as "treason to the party"; but the republicans, especially from the
east, came to his rescue and in 1893 swept the troublesome sections of
the law from the statute book. the anger of the silver faction knew no
bounds, and the leaders made ready for the approaching presidential
campaign.


the protective tariff and taxation

=fluctuation in tariff policy.=--as each of the old parties was divided
on the currency question, it is not surprising that there was some
confusion in their ranks over the tariff. like the silver issue, the
tariff tended to align the manufacturing east against the agricultural
west and south rather than to cut directly between the two parties.
still the republicans on the whole stood firmly by the rates imposed
during the civil war. if we except the reductions of 1872 which were
soon offset by increases, we may say that those rates were substantially
unchanged for nearly twenty years. when a revision was brought about,
however, it was initiated by republican leaders. seeing a huge surplus
of revenue in the treasury in 1883, they anticipated popular clamor by
revising the tariff on the theory that it ought to be reformed by its
friends rather than by its enemies. on the other hand, it was the
republicans also who enacted the mckinley tariff bill of 1890, which
carried protection to its highest point up to that time.

the democrats on their part were not all confirmed free traders or even
advocates of tariff for revenue only. in cleveland's first
administration they did attack the protective system in the house, where
they had a majority, and in this they were vigorously supported by the
president. the assault, however, proved to be a futile gesture for it
was blocked by the republicans in the senate. when, after the sweeping
victory of 1892, the democrats in the house again attempted to bring
down the tariff by the wilson bill of 1894, they were checkmated by
their own party colleagues in the upper chamber. in the end they were
driven into a compromise that looked more like a mckinley than a calhoun
tariff. the republicans taunted them with being "babes in the woods."
president cleveland was so dissatisfied with the bill that he refused to
sign it, allowing it to become a law, on the lapse of ten days, without
his approval.

=the income tax of 1894.=--the advocates of tariff reduction usually
associated with their proposal a tax on incomes. the argument which
they advanced in support of their program was simple. most of the
industries, they said, are in the east and the protective tariff which
taxes consumers for the benefit of manufacturers is, in effect, a
tribute laid upon the rest of the country. as an offset they offered a
tax on large incomes; this owing to the heavy concentration of rich
people in the east, would fall mainly upon the beneficiaries of
protection. "we propose," said one of them, "to place a part of the
burden upon the accumulated wealth of the country instead of placing it
all upon the consumption of the people." in this spirit the sponsors of
the wilson tariff bill laid a tax upon all incomes of $4000 a year or
more.

in taking this step, the democrats encountered opposition in their own
party. senator hill, of new york, turned fiercely upon them, exclaiming:
"the professors with their books, the socialists with their schemes, the
anarchists with their bombs are all instructing the people in the ...
principles of taxation." even the eastern republicans were hardly as
savage in their denunciation of the tax. but all this labor was wasted.
the next year the supreme court of the united states declared the income
tax to be a direct tax, and therefore null and void because it was laid
on incomes wherever found and not apportioned among the states according
to population. the fact that four of the nine judges dissented from this
decision was also an index to the diversity of opinion that divided both
parties.


the railways and trusts

=the grangers and state regulation.=--the same uncertainty about the
railways and trusts pervaded the ranks of the republicans and democrats.
as to the railways, the first firm and consistent demand for their
regulation came from the west. there the farmers, in the early
seventies, having got control in state legislatures, particularly in
iowa, wisconsin, and illinois, enacted drastic laws prescribing the
maximum charges which companies could make for carrying freight and
passengers. the application of these measures, however, was limited
because the state could not fix the rates for transporting goods and
passengers beyond its own borders. the power of regulating interstate
commerce, under the constitution, belonged to congress.

=the interstate commerce act of 1887.=--within a few years, the movement
which had been so effective in western legislatures appeared at
washington in the form of demands for the federal regulation of
interstate rates. in 1887, the pressure became so strong that congress
created the interstate commerce commission and forbade many abuses on
the part of railways; such as discriminating in charges between one
shipper and another and granting secret rebates to favored persons. this
law was a significant beginning; but it left the main question of
rate-fixing untouched, much to the discontent of farmers and shippers.

=the sherman anti-trust law of 1890.=--as in the case of the railways,
attacks upon the trusts were first made in state legislatures, where it
became the fashion to provide severe penalties for those who formed
monopolies and "conspired to enhance prices." republicans and democrats
united in the promotion of measures of this kind. as in the case of the
railways also, the movement to curb the trusts soon had spokesmen at
washington. though blaine had declared that "trusts were largely a
private affair with which neither the president nor any private citizen
had any particular right to interfere," it was a republican congress
that enacted in 1890 the first measure--the sherman anti-trust
law--directed against great combinations in business. this act declared
illegal "every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise,
or conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce among the several
states or with foreign nations."

=the futility of the anti-trust law.=--whether the sherman law was
directed against all combinations or merely those which placed an
"unreasonable restraint" on trade and competition was not apparent.
senator platt of connecticut, a careful statesman of the old school,
averred: "the questions of whether the bill would be operative, of how
it would operate, or whether it was within the power of congress to
enact it, have been whistled down the wind in this senate as idle talk
and the whole effort has been to get some bill headed: 'a bill to punish
trusts,' with which to go to the country." whatever its purpose, its
effect upon existing trusts and upon the formation of new combinations
was negligible. it was practically unenforced by president harrison and
president cleveland, in spite of the constant demand for harsh action
against "monopolies." it was patent that neither the republicans nor the
democrats were prepared for a war on the trusts to the bitter end.


the minor parties and unrest

=the demands of dissenting parties.=--from the election of 1872, when
horace greeley made his ill-fated excursion into politics, onward, there
appeared in each presidential campaign one, and sometimes two or more
parties, stressing issues that appealed mainly to wage-earners and
farmers. whether they chose to call themselves labor reformers,
greenbackers, or anti-monopolists, their slogans and their platforms all
pointed in one direction. even the prohibitionists, who in 1872 started
on their career with a single issue, the abolition of the liquor
traffic, found themselves making declarations of faith on other matters
and hopelessly split over the money question in 1896.

a composite view of the platforms put forth by the dissenting parties
from the administration of grant to the close of cleveland's second term
reveals certain notions common to them all. these included among many
others: the earliest possible payment of the national debt; regulation
of the rates of railways and telegraph companies; repeal of the specie
resumption act of 1875; the issue of legal tender notes by the
government convertible into interest-bearing obligations on demand;
unlimited coinage of silver as well as gold; a graduated inheritance
tax; legislation to take from "land, railroad, money, and other gigantic
corporate monopolies ... the powers they have so corruptly and unjustly
usurped"; popular or direct election of united states senators; woman
suffrage; and a graduated income tax, "placing the burden of government
on those who can best afford to pay instead of laying it on the farmers
and producers."

=criticism of the old parties.=--to this long program of measures the
reformers added harsh and acrid criticism of the old parties and
sometimes, it must be said, of established institutions of government.
"we denounce," exclaimed the labor party in 1888, "the democratic and
republican parties as hopelessly and shamelessly corrupt and by reason
of their affiliation with monopolies equally unworthy of the suffrages
of those who do not live upon public plunder." "the united states
senate," insisted the greenbackers, "is a body composed largely of
aristocratic millionaires who according to their own party papers
generally purchased their elections in order to protect the great
monopolies which they represent." indeed, if their platforms are to be
accepted at face value, the greenbackers believed that the entire
government had passed out of the hands of the people.

=the grangers.=--this unsparing, not to say revolutionary, criticism of
american political life, appealed, it seems, mainly to farmers in the
middle west. always active in politics, they had, before the civil war,
cast their lot as a rule with one or the other of the leading parties.
in 1867, however, there grew up among them an association known as the
"patrons of husbandry," which was destined to play a large role in the
partisan contests of the succeeding decades. this society, which
organized local lodges or "granges" on principles of secrecy and
fraternity, was originally designed to promote in a general way the
interests of the farmers. its political bearings were apparently not
grasped at first by its promoters. yet, appealing as it did to the most
active and independent spirits among the farmers and gathering to itself
the strength that always comes from organization, it soon found itself
in the hands of leaders more or less involved in politics. where a few
votes are marshaled together in a democracy, there is power.

=the greenback party.=--the first extensive activity of the grangers was
connected with the attack on the railways in the middle west which
forced several state legislatures to reduce freight and passenger rates
by law. at the same time, some leaders in the movement, no doubt
emboldened by this success, launched in 1876 a new political party,
popularly known as the greenbackers, favoring a continued re-issue of
the legal tenders. the beginnings were disappointing; but two years
later, in the congressional elections, the greenbackers swept whole
sections of the country. their candidates polled more than a million
votes and fourteen of them were returned to the house of
representatives. to all outward signs a new and formidable party had
entered the lists.

the sanguine hopes of the leaders proved to be illusory. the quiet
operations of the resumption act the following year, a revival of
industry from a severe panic which had set in during 1873, the silver
purchase act, and the re-issue of greenbacks cut away some of the
grounds of agitation. there was also a diversion of forces to the silver
faction which had a substantial support in the silver mine owners of the
west. at all events the greenback vote fell to about 300,000 in the
election of 1880. a still greater drop came four years later and the
party gave up the ghost, its sponsors returning to their former
allegiance or sulking in their tents.

=the rise of the populist party.=--those leaders of the old parties who
now looked for a happy future unvexed by new factions were doomed to
disappointment. the funeral of the greenback party was hardly over
before there arose two other political specters in the agrarian
sections: the national farmers' alliance and industrial union,
particularly strong in the south and west; and the farmers' alliance,
operating in the north. by 1890 the two orders claimed over three
million members. as in the case of the grangers many years before, the
leaders among them found an easy way into politics. in 1892 they held a
convention, nominated a candidate for president, and adopted the name of
"people's party," from which they were known as populists. their
platform, in every line, breathed a spirit of radicalism. they declared
that "the newspapers are largely subsidized or muzzled; public opinion
silenced; business prostrate; our homes covered with mortgages; and the
land concentrating in the hands of capitalists.... the fruits of the
toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a
few." having delivered this sweeping indictment, the populists put
forward their remedies: the free coinage of silver, a graduated income
tax, postal savings banks, and government ownership of railways and
telegraphs. at the same time they approved the initiative, referendum,
and popular election of senators, and condemned the use of federal
troops in labor disputes. on this platform, the populists polled over a
million votes, captured twenty-two presidential electors, and sent a
powerful delegation to congress.

=industrial distress augments unrest.=--the four years intervening
between the campaign of 1892 and the next presidential election brought
forth many events which aggravated the ill-feeling expressed in the
portentous platform of populism. cleveland, a consistent enemy of free
silver, gave his powerful support to the gold standard and insisted on
the repeal of the silver purchase act, thus alienating an increasing
number of his own party. in 1893 a grave industrial crisis fell upon the
land: banks and business houses went into bankruptcy with startling
rapidity; factories were closed; idle men thronged the streets hunting
for work; and the prices of wheat and corn dropped to a ruinous level.
labor disputes also filled the crowded record. a strike at the pullman
car works in chicago spread to the railways. disorders ensued. president
cleveland, against the protests of the governor of illinois, john p.
altgeld, dispatched troops to the scene of action. the united states
district court at chicago issued an injunction forbidding the president
of the railway union, eugene v. debs, or his assistants to interfere
with the transmission of the mails or interstate commerce in any form.
for refusing to obey the order, debs was arrested and imprisoned. with
federal troops in possession of the field, with their leader in jail,
the strikers gave up the battle, defeated but not subdued. to cap the
climax the supreme court of the united states, the following year (1895)
declared null and void the income tax law just enacted by congress, thus
fanning the flames of populist discontent all over the west and south.


the sound money battle of 1896

=conservative men alarmed.=--men of conservative thought and leaning in
both parties were by this time thoroughly disturbed. they looked upon
the rise of populism and the growth of labor disputes as the signs of a
revolutionary spirit, indeed nothing short of a menace to american
institutions and ideals. the income tax law of 1894, exclaimed the
distinguished new york advocate, joseph h. choate, in an impassioned
speech before the supreme court, "is communistic in its purposes and
tendencies and is defended here upon principles as communistic,
socialistic--what shall i call them--populistic as ever have been
addressed to any political assembly in the world." mr. justice field in
the name of the court replied: "the present assault upon capital is but
the beginning. it will be but the stepping stone to others larger and
more sweeping till our political conditions will become a war of the
poor against the rich." in declaring the income tax unconstitutional, he
believed that he was but averting greater evils lurking under its guise.
as for free silver, nearly all conservative men were united in calling
it a measure of confiscation and repudiation; an effort of the debtors
to pay their obligations with money worth fifty cents on the dollar; the
climax of villainies openly defended; a challenge to law, order, and
honor.

=the republicans come out for the gold standard.=--it was among the
republicans that this opinion was most widely shared and firmly held. it
was they who picked up the gauge thrown down by the populists, though a
host of democrats, like cleveland and hill of new york, also battled
against the growing populist defection in democratic ranks. when the
republican national convention assembled in 1896, the die was soon
cast; a declaration of opposition to free silver save by international
agreement was carried by a vote of eight to one. the republican party,
to use the vigorous language of mr. lodge, arrayed itself against "not
only that organized failure, the democratic party, but all the wandering
forces of political chaos and social disorder ... in these bitter times
when the forces of disorder are loose and the wreckers with their false
lights gather at the shore to lure the ship of state upon the rocks."
yet it is due to historic truth to state that mckinley, whom the
republicans nominated, had voted in congress for the free coinage of
silver, was widely known as a bimetallist, and was only with difficulty
persuaded to accept the unequivocal indorsement of the gold standard
which was pressed upon him by his counselors. having accepted it,
however, he proved to be a valiant champion, though his major interest
was undoubtedly in the protective tariff. to him nothing was more
reprehensible than attempts "to array class against class, 'the classes
against the masses,' section against section, labor against capital,
'the poor against the rich,' or interest against interest." such was the
language of his acceptance speech. the whole program of populism he now
viewed as a "sudden, dangerous, and revolutionary assault upon law and
order."

=the democratic convention at chicago.=--never, save at the great
disruption on the eve of the civil war, did a democratic national
convention display more feeling than at chicago in 1896. from the
opening prayer to the last motion before the house, every act, every
speech, every scene, every resolution evoked passions and sowed
dissensions. departing from long party custom, it voted down in anger a
proposal to praise the administration of the democratic president,
cleveland. when the platform with its radical planks, including free
silver, was reported, a veritable storm broke. senator hill, trembling
with emotion, protested against the departure from old tests of
democratic allegiance; against principles that must drive out of the
party men who had grown gray in its service; against revolutionary,
unwise, and unprecedented steps in the history of the party. senator
vilas of wisconsin, in great fervor, avowed that there was no difference
in principle between the free coinage of silver--"the confiscation of
one-half of the credits of the nation for the benefit of debtors"--and
communism itself--"a universal distribution of property." in the triumph
of that cause he saw the beginning of "the overthrow of all law, all
justice, all security and repose in the social order."

william j. bryan in 1898]

=the crown of thorns speech.=--the champions of free silver replied in
strident tones. they accused the gold advocates of being the aggressors
who had assailed the labor and the homes of the people. william jennings
bryan, of nebraska, voiced their sentiments in a memorable oration. he
declared that their cause "was as holy as the cause of liberty--the
cause of humanity." he exclaimed that the contest was between the idle
holders of idle capital and the toiling millions. then he named those
for whom he spoke--the wage-earner, the country lawyer, the small
merchant, the farmer, and the miner. "the man who is employed for wages
is as much a business man as his employer. the attorney in a country
town is as much a business man as the corporation counsel in a great
metropolis. the merchant at the cross roads store is as much a business
man as the merchant of new york. the farmer ... is as much a business
man as the man who goes upon the board of trade and bets upon the price
of grain. the miners who go a thousand feet into the earth or climb two
thousand feet upon the cliffs ... are as much business men as the few
financial magnates who in a back room corner the money of the world....
it is for these that we speak. we do not come as aggressors. ours is not
a war of conquest. we are fighting in defense of our homes, our
families, and our posterity. we have petitioned and our petitions have
been scorned. we have entreated and our entreaties have been
disregarded. we have begged and they have mocked when our calamity came.
we beg no longer; we entreat no more; we petition no more. we defy
them.... we shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to
them, 'you shall not press upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns.
you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.'"

=bryan nominated.=--in all the history of national conventions never had
an orator so completely swayed a multitude; not even yancey in his
memorable plea in the charleston convention of 1860 when, with grave and
moving eloquence, he espoused the southern cause against the impending
fates. the delegates, after cheering mr. bryan until they could cheer no
more, tore the standards from the floor and gathered around the nebraska
delegation to renew the deafening applause. the platform as reported was
carried by a vote of two to one and the young orator from the west,
hailed as america's tiberius gracchus, was nominated as the democratic
candidate for president. the south and west had triumphed over the east.
the division was sectional, admittedly sectional--the old combination of
power which calhoun had so anxiously labored to build up a century
earlier. the gold democrats were repudiated in terms which were clear to
all. a few, unable to endure the thought of voting the republican
ticket, held a convention at indianapolis where, with the sanction of
cleveland, they nominated candidates of their own and endorsed the gold
standard in a forlorn hope.

=the democratic platform.=--it was to the call from chicago that the
democrats gave heed and the republicans made answer. the platform on
which mr. bryan stood, unlike most party manifestoes, was explicit in
its language and its appeal. it denounced the practice of allowing
national banks to issue notes intended to circulate as money on the
ground that it was "in derogation of the constitution," recalling
jackson's famous attack on the bank in 1832. it declared that tariff
duties should be laid "for the purpose of revenue"--calhoun's doctrine.
in demanding the free coinage of silver, it recurred to the practice
abandoned in 1873. the income tax came next on the program. the platform
alleged that the law of 1894, passed by a democratic congress, was "in
strict pursuance of the uniform decisions of the supreme court for
nearly a hundred years," and then hinted that the decision annulling the
law might be reversed by the same body "as it may hereafter be
constituted."

the appeal to labor voiced by mr. bryan in his "crown of thorns" speech
was reinforced in the platform. "as labor creates the wealth of the
country," ran one plank, "we demand the passage of such laws as may be
necessary to protect it in all its rights." referring to the recent
pullman strike, the passions of which had not yet died away, the
platform denounced "arbitrary interference by federal authorities in
local affairs as a violation of the constitution of the united states
and a crime against free institutions." a special objection was lodged
against "government by injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of
oppression by which federal judges, in contempt of the laws of states
and rights of citizens, become at once legislators, judges, and
executioners." the remedy advanced was a federal law assuring trial by
jury in all cases of contempt in labor disputes. having made this
declaration of faith, the democrats, with mr. bryan at the head, raised
their standard of battle.

=the heated campaign.=--the campaign which ensued outrivaled in the
range of its educational activities and the bitterness of its tone all
other political conflicts in american history, not excepting the fateful
struggle of 1860. immense sums of money were contributed to the funds of
both parties. railway, banking, and other corporations gave generously
to the republicans; the silver miners, less lavishly but with the same
anxiety, supported the democrats. the country was flooded with
pamphlets, posters, and handbills. every public forum, from the great
auditoriums of the cities to the "red schoolhouses" on the countryside,
was occupied by the opposing forces.

mr. bryan took the stump himself, visiting all parts of the country in
special trains and addressing literally millions of people in the open
air. mr. mckinley chose the older and more formal plan. he received
delegations at his home in canton and discussed the issues of the
campaign from his front porch, leaving to an army of well-organized
orators the task of reaching the people in their home towns. parades,
processions, and monster demonstrations filled the land with politics.
whole states were polled in advance by the republicans and the doubtful
voters personally visited by men equipped with arguments and literature.
manufacturers, frightened at the possibility of disordered public
credit, announced that they would close their doors if the democrats won
the election. men were dismissed from public and private places on
account of their political views, one eminent college president being
forced out for advocating free silver. the language employed by
impassioned and embittered speakers on both sides roused the public to a
state of frenzy, once more showing the lengths to which men could go in
personal and political abuse.

=the republican victory.=--the verdict of the nation was decisive.
mckinley received 271 of the 447 electoral votes, and 7,111,000 popular
votes as against bryan's 6,509,000. the congressional elections were
equally positive although, on account of the composition of the senate,
the "hold-over" democrats and populists still enjoyed a power out of
proportion to their strength as measured at the polls. even as it was,
the republicans got full control of both houses--a dominion of the
entire government which they were to hold for fourteen years--until the
second half of mr. taft's administration, when they lost possession of
the house of representatives. the yoke of indecision was broken. the
party of sound finance and protective tariffs set out upon its lease of
power with untroubled assurance.


republican measures and results

=the gold standard and the tariff.=--yet strange as it may seem, the
republicans did not at once enact legislation making the gold dollar the
standard for the national currency. not until 1900 did they take that
positive step. in his first inaugural president mckinley, as if still
uncertain in his own mind or fearing a revival of the contest just
closed, placed the tariff, not the money question, in the forefront.
"the people have decided," he said, "that such legislation should be had
as will give ample protection and encouragement to the industries and
development of our country." protection for american industries,
therefore, he urged, is the task before congress. "with adequate revenue
secured, but not until then, we can enter upon changes in our fiscal
laws." as the republicans had only forty-six of the ninety senators, and
at least four of them were known advocates of free silver, the
discretion exercised by the president in selecting the tariff for
congressional debate was the better part of valor.

congress gave heed to the warning. under the direction of nelson p.
dingley, whose name was given to the bill, a tariff measure levying the
highest rates yet laid in the history of american imposts was prepared
and driven through the house of representatives. the opposition
encountered in the senate, especially from the west, was overcome by
concessions in favor of that section; but the duties on sugar, tin,
steel, lumber, hemp, and in fact all of the essential commodities
handled by combinations and trusts, were materially raised.

[illustration: _copyright by underwood and underwood, n.y._

president mckinley and his cabinet]

=growth of combinations.=--the years that followed the enactment of the
dingley law were, whatever the cause, the most prosperous the country
had witnessed for many a decade. industries of every kind were soon
running full blast; labor was employed; commerce spread more swiftly
than ever to the markets of the world. coincident with this progress was
the organization of the greatest combinations and trusts the world had
yet seen. in 1899 the smelters formed a trust with a capital of
$65,000,000; in the same year the standard oil company with a capital of
over one hundred millions took the place of the old trust; and the
copper trust was incorporated under the laws of new jersey, its par
value capital being fixed shortly afterward at $175,000,000. a year
later the national sugar refining company, of new jersey, started with a
capital of $90,000,000, adopting the policy of issuing to the
stockholders no public statement of its earnings or financial condition.
before another twelvemonth had elapsed all previous corporate financing
was reduced to small proportions by the flotation of the united states
steel corporation with a capital of more than a billion dollars, an
enterprise set in motion by the famous morgan banking house of new york.

in nearly all these gigantic undertakings, the same great leaders in
finance were more or less intimately associated. to use the language of
an eminent authority: "they are all allied and intertwined by their
various mutual interests. for instance, the pennsylvania railroad
interests are on the one hand allied with the vanderbilts and on the
other with the rockefellers. the vanderbilts are closely allied with the
morgan group.... viewed as a whole we find the dominating influences in
the trusts to be made up of a network of large and small capitalists,
many allied to one another by ties of more or less importance, but all
being appendages to or parts of the greater groups which are themselves
dependent on and allied with the two mammoth or rockefeller and morgan
groups. these two mammoth groups jointly ... constitute the heart of the
business and commercial life of the nation." such was the picture of
triumphant business enterprise drawn by a financier within a few years
after the memorable campaign of 1896.

america had become one of the first workshops of the world. it was, by
virtue of the closely knit organization of its business and finance, one
of the most powerful and energetic leaders in the struggle of the giants
for the business of the earth. the capital of the steel corporation
alone was more than ten times the total national debt which the apostles
of calamity in the days of washington and hamilton declared the nation
could never pay. american industry, filling domestic markets to
overflowing, was ready for new worlds to conquer.

chapter xx

america a world power (1865-1900)


it has now become a fashion, sanctioned by wide usage and by eminent
historians, to speak of america, triumphant over spain and possessed of
new colonies, as entering the twentieth century in the role of "a world
power," for the first time. perhaps at this late day, it is useless to
protest against the currency of the idea. nevertheless, the truth is
that from the fateful moment in march, 1775, when edmund burke unfolded
to his colleagues in the british parliament the resources of an
invincible america, down to the settlement at versailles in 1919 closing
the drama of the world war, this nation has been a world power,
influencing by its example, by its institutions, by its wealth, trade,
and arms the course of international affairs. and it should be said also
that neither in the field of commercial enterprise nor in that of
diplomacy has it been wanting in spirit or ingenuity.

when john hay, secretary of state, heard that an american citizen,
perdicaris, had been seized by raisuli, a moroccan bandit, in 1904, he
wired his brusque message: "we want perdicaris alive or raisuli dead."
this was but an echo of commodore decatur's equally characteristic
answer, "not a minute," given nearly a hundred years before to the
pirates of algiers begging for time to consider whether they would cease
preying upon american merchantmen. was it not as early as 1844 that the
american commissioner, caleb cushing, taking advantage of the british
opium war on china, negotiated with the celestial empire a successful
commercial treaty? did he not then exultantly exclaim: "the laws of the
union follow its citizens and its banner protects them even within the
domain of the chinese empire"? was it not almost half a century before
the battle of manila bay in 1898, that commodore perry with an adequate
naval force "gently coerced japan into friendship with us," leading all
the nations of the earth in the opening of that empire to the trade of
the occident? nor is it inappropriate in this connection to recall the
fact that the monroe doctrine celebrates in 1923 its hundredth
anniversary.


american foreign relations (1865-98)

=french intrigues in mexico blocked.=--between the war for the union and
the war with spain, the department of state had many an occasion to
present the rights of america among the powers of the world. only a
little while after the civil conflict came to a close, it was called
upon to deal with a dangerous situation created in mexico by the
ambitions of napoleon iii. during the administration of buchanan, mexico
had fallen into disorder through the strife of the liberal and the
clerical parties; the president asked for authority to use american
troops to bring to a peaceful haven "a wreck upon the ocean, drifting
about as she is impelled by different factions." our own domestic crisis
then intervened.

observing the united states heavily involved in its own problems, the
great powers, england, france, and spain, decided in the autumn of 1861
to take a hand themselves in restoring order in mexico. they entered
into an agreement to enforce the claims of their citizens against mexico
and to protect their subjects residing in that republic. they invited
the united states to join them, and, on meeting a polite refusal, they
prepared for a combined military and naval demonstration on their own
account. in the midst of this action england and spain, discovering the
sinister purposes of napoleon, withdrew their troops and left the field
to him.

the french emperor, it was well known, looked with jealousy upon the
growth of the united states and dreamed of establishing in the western
hemisphere an imperial power to offset the american republic.
intervention to collect debts was only a cloak for his deeper designs.
throwing off that guise in due time, he made the archduke maximilian, a
brother of the ruler of austria, emperor in mexico, and surrounded his
throne by french soldiers, in spite of all protests.

this insolent attack upon the mexican republic, deeply resented in the
united states, was allowed to drift in its course until 1865. at that
juncture general sheridan was dispatched to the mexican border with a
large armed force; general grant urged the use of the american army to
expel the french from this continent. the secretary of state, seward,
counseled negotiation first, and, applying the monroe doctrine, was able
to prevail upon napoleon iii to withdraw his troops. without the support
of french arms, the sham empire in mexico collapsed like a house of
cards and the unhappy maximilian, the victim of french ambition and
intrigue, met his death at the hands of a mexican firing squad.

=alaska purchased.=--the mexican affair had not been brought to a close
before the department of state was busy with negotiations which resulted
in the purchase of alaska from russia. the treaty of cession, signed on
march 30, 1867, added to the united states a domain of nearly six
hundred thousand square miles, a territory larger than texas and nearly
three-fourths the size of the louisiana purchase. though it was a
distant colony separated from our continental domain by a thousand miles
of water, no question of "imperialism" or "colonization foreign to
american doctrines" seems to have been raised at the time. the treaty
was ratified promptly by the senate. the purchase price, $7,200,000, was
voted by the house of representatives after the display of some
resentment against a system that compelled it to appropriate money to
fulfill an obligation which it had no part in making. seward, who
formulated the treaty, rejoiced, as he afterwards said, that he had kept
alaska out of the hands of england.

=american interest in the caribbean.=--having achieved this diplomatic
triumph, seward turned to the increase of american power in another
direction. he negotiated, with denmark, a treaty providing for the
purchase of the islands of st. john and st. thomas in the west indies,
strategic points in the caribbean for sea power. this project, long
afterward brought to fruition by other men, was defeated on this
occasion by the refusal of the senate to ratify the treaty. evidently it
was not yet prepared to exercise colonial dominion over other races.

undaunted by the misadventure in caribbean policies, president grant
warmly advocated the acquisition of santo domingo. this little republic
had long been in a state of general disorder. in 1869 a treaty of
annexation was concluded with its president. the document grant
transmitted to the senate with his cordial approval, only to have it
rejected. not at all changed in his opinion by the outcome of his
effort, he continued to urge the subject of annexation. even in his last
message to congress he referred to it, saying that time had only proved
the wisdom of his early course. the addition of santo domingo to the
american sphere of protection was the work of a later generation. the
state department, temporarily checked, had to bide its time.

=the _alabama_ claims arbitrated.=--indeed, it had in hand a far more
serious matter, a vexing issue that grew out of civil war diplomacy. the
british government, as already pointed out in other connections, had
permitted confederate cruisers, including the famous _alabama_, built in
british ports, to escape and prey upon the commerce of the northern
states. this action, denounced at the time by our government as a grave
breach of neutrality as well as a grievous injury to american citizens,
led first to remonstrances and finally to repeated claims for damages
done to american ships and goods. for a long time great britain was
firm. her foreign secretary denied all obligations in the premises,
adding somewhat curtly that "he wished to say once for all that her
majesty's government disclaimed any responsibility for the losses and
hoped that they had made their position perfectly clear." still
president grant was not persuaded that the door of diplomacy, though
closed, was barred. hamilton fish, his secretary of state, renewed the
demand. finally he secured from the british government in 1871 the
treaty of washington providing for the arbitration not merely of the
_alabama_ and other claims but also all points of serious controversy
between the two countries.

the tribunal of arbitration thus authorized sat at geneva in
switzerland, and after a long and careful review of the arguments on
both sides awarded to the united states the lump sum of $15,500,000 to
be distributed among the american claimants. the damages thus allowed
were large, unquestionably larger than strict justice required and it is
not surprising that the decision excited much adverse comment in
england. nevertheless, the prompt payment by the british government
swept away at once a great cloud of ill-feeling in america. moreover,
the spectacle of two powerful nations choosing the way of peaceful
arbitration to settle an angry dispute seemed a happy, if illusory, omen
of a modern method for avoiding the arbitrament of war.

=samoa.=--if the senate had its doubts at first about the wisdom of
acquiring strategic points for naval power in distant seas, the same
could not be said of the state department or naval officers. in 1872
commander meade, of the united states navy, alive to the importance of
coaling stations even in mid-ocean, made a commercial agreement with the
chief of tutuila, one of the samoan islands, far below the equator, in
the southern pacific, nearer to australia than to california. this
agreement, providing among other things for our use of the harbor of
pago pago as a naval base, was six years later changed into a formal
treaty ratified by the senate.

such enterprise could not escape the vigilant eyes of england and
germany, both mindful of the course of the sea power in history. the
german emperor, seizing as a pretext a quarrel between his consul in the
islands and a native king, laid claim to an interest in the samoan
group. england, aware of the dangers arising from german outposts in the
southern seas so near to australia, was not content to stand aside. so
it happened that all three countries sent battleships to the samoan
waters, threatening a crisis that was fortunately averted by friendly
settlement. if, as is alleged, germany entertained a notion of
challenging american sea power then and there, the presence of british
ships must have dispelled that dream.

the result of the affair was a tripartite agreement by which the three
powers in 1889 undertook a protectorate over the islands. but joint
control proved unsatisfactory. there was constant friction between the
germans and the english. the spheres of authority being vague and open
to dispute, the plan had to be abandoned at the end of ten years.
england withdrew altogether, leaving to germany all the islands except
tutuila, which was ceded outright to the united states. thus one of the
finest harbors in the pacific, to the intense delight of the american
navy, passed permanently under american dominion. another triumph in
diplomacy was set down to the credit of the state department.

=cleveland and the venezuela affair.=--in the relations with south
america, as well as in those with the distant pacific, the diplomacy of
the government at washington was put to the test. for some time it had
been watching a dispute between england and venezuela over the western
boundary of british guiana and, on an appeal from venezuela, it had
taken a lively interest in the contest. in 1895 president cleveland saw
that great britain would yield none of her claims. after hearing the
arguments of venezuela, his secretary of state, richard t. olney, in a
note none too conciliatory, asked the british government whether it was
willing to arbitrate the points in controversy. this inquiry he
accompanied by a warning to the effect that the united states could not
permit any european power to contest its mastery in this hemisphere.
"the united states," said the secretary, "is practically sovereign on
this continent and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it
confines its interposition.... its infinite resources, combined with its
isolated position, render it master of the situation and practically
invulnerable against any or all other powers."

the reply evoked from the british government by this strong statement
was firm and clear. the monroe doctrine, it said, even if not so widely
stretched by interpretation, was not binding in international law; the
dispute with venezuela was a matter of interest merely to the parties
involved; and arbitration of the question was impossible. this response
called forth president cleveland's startling message of 1895. he asked
congress to create a commission authorized to ascertain by researches
the true boundary between venezuela and british guiana. he added that it
would be the duty of this country "to resist by every means in its
power, as a willful aggression upon its rights and interests, the
appropriation by great britain of any lands or the exercise of
governmental jurisdiction over any territory which, after investigation,
we have determined of right belongs to venezuela." the serious character
of this statement he thoroughly understood. he declared that he was
conscious of his responsibilities, intimating that war, much as it was
to be deplored, was not comparable to "a supine submission to wrong and
injustice and the consequent loss of national self-respect and honor."

[illustration: grover cleveland]

the note of defiance which ran through this message, greeted by shrill
cries of enthusiasm in many circles, was viewed in other quarters as a
portent of war. responsible newspapers in both countries spoke of an
armed settlement of the dispute as inevitable. congress created the
commission and appropriated money for the investigation; a body of
learned men was appointed to determine the merits of the conflicting
boundary claims. the british government, deaf to the clamor of the
bellicose section of the london press, deplored the incident,
courteously replied in the affirmative to a request for assistance in
the search for evidence, and finally agreed to the proposition that the
issue be submitted to arbitration. the outcome of this somewhat perilous
dispute contributed not a little to cleveland's reputation as "a
sterling representative of the true american spirit." this was not
diminished when the tribunal of arbitration found that great britain was
on the whole right in her territorial claims against venezuela.

=the annexation of hawaii.=--while engaged in the dangerous venezuela
controversy, president cleveland was compelled by a strange turn in
events to consider the annexation of the hawaiian islands in the
mid-pacific. for more than half a century american missionaries had been
active in converting the natives to the christian faith and enterprising
american business men had been developing the fertile sugar plantations.
both the department of state and the navy department were fully
conscious of the strategic relation of the islands to the growth of sea
power and watched with anxiety any developments likely to bring them
under some other dominion.

the country at large was indifferent, however, until 1893, when a
revolution, headed by americans, broke out, ending in the overthrow of
the native government, the abolition of the primitive monarchy, and the
retirement of queen liliuokalani to private life. this crisis, a
repetition of the texas affair in a small theater, was immediately
followed by a demand from the new hawaiian government for annexation to
the united states. president harrison looked with favor on the proposal,
negotiated the treaty of annexation, and laid it before the senate for
approval. there it still rested when his term of office was brought to a
close.

harrison's successor, cleveland, it was well known, had doubts about the
propriety of american action in hawaii. for the purpose of making an
inquiry into the matter, he sent a special commissioner to the islands.
on the basis of the report of his agent, cleveland came to the
conclusion that "the revolution in the island kingdom had been
accomplished by the improper use of the armed forces of the united
states and that the wrong should be righted by a restoration of the
queen to her throne." such being his matured conviction, though the
facts upon which he rested it were warmly controverted, he could do
nothing but withdraw the treaty from the senate and close the incident.

to the republicans this sharp and cavalier disposal of their plans,
carried out in a way that impugned the motives of a republican
president, was nothing less than "a betrayal of american interests." in
their platform of 1896 they made clear their position: "our foreign
policy should be at all times firm, vigorous, and dignified and all our
interests in the western hemisphere carefully watched and guarded. the
hawaiian islands should be controlled by the united states and no
foreign power should be permitted to interfere with them." there was no
mistaking this view of the issue. as the vote in the election gave
popular sanction to republican policies, congress by a joint resolution,
passed on july 6, 1898, annexed the islands to the united states and
later conferred upon them the ordinary territorial form of government.


cuba and the spanish war

=early american relations with cuba.=--the year that brought hawaii
finally under the american flag likewise drew to a conclusion another
long controversy over a similar outpost in the atlantic, one of the last
remnants of the once glorious spanish empire--the island of cuba.

for a century the department of state had kept an anxious eye upon this
base of power, knowing full well that both france and england, already
well established in the west indies, had their attention also fixed upon
cuba. in the administration of president fillmore they had united in
proposing to the united states a tripartite treaty guaranteeing spain in
her none too certain ownership. this proposal, squarely rejected,
furnished the occasion for a statement of american policy which stood
the test of all the years that followed; namely, that the affair was one
between spain and the united states alone.

in that long contest in the united states for the balance of power
between the north and south, leaders in the latter section often thought
of bringing cuba into the union to offset the free states. an
opportunity to announce their purposes publicly was afforded in 1854 by
a controversy over the seizure of an american ship by cuban authorities.
on that occasion three american ministers abroad, stationed at madrid,
paris, and london respectively, held a conference and issued the
celebrated "ostend manifesto." they united in declaring that cuba, by
her geographical position, formed a part of the united states, that
possession by a foreign power was inimical to american interests, and
that an effort should be made to purchase the island from spain. in case
the owner refused to sell, they concluded, with a menacing flourish, "by
every law, human and divine, we shall be justified in wresting it from
spain if we possess the power." this startling proclamation to the world
was promptly disowned by the united states government.

a sight too bad

_struggling cuba._ "you must be awfully near-sighted, mr. president, not
to recognize me." _u.s.g._ "no, i am far-sighted: for i can recognize
france."]

=revolutions in cuba.=--for nearly twenty years afterwards the cuban
question rested. then it was revived in another form during president
grant's administrations, when the natives became engaged in a
destructive revolt against spanish officials. for ten years--1868-78--a
guerrilla warfare raged in the island. american citizens, by virtue of
their ancient traditions of democracy, naturally sympathized with a war
for independence and self-government. expeditions to help the insurgents
were fitted out secretly in american ports. arms and supplies were
smuggled into cuba. american soldiers of fortune joined their ranks. the
enforcement of neutrality against the friends of cuban independence, no
pleasing task for a sympathetic president, the protection of american
lives and property in the revolutionary area, and similar matters kept
our government busy with cuba for a whole decade.

a brief lull in cuban disorders was followed in 1895 by a renewal of the
revolutionary movement. the contest between the rebels and the spanish
troops, marked by extreme cruelty and a total disregard for life and
property, exceeded all bounds of decency, and once more raised the old
questions that had tormented grant's administration. gomez, the leader
of the revolt, intent upon provoking american interference, laid waste
the land with fire and sword. by a proclamation of november 6, 1895, he
ordered the destruction of sugar plantations and railway connections and
the closure of all sugar factories. the work of ruin was completed by
the ruthless spanish general, weyler, who concentrated the inhabitants
from rural regions into military camps, where they died by the hundreds
of disease and starvation. stories of the atrocities, bad enough in
simple form, became lurid when transmuted into american news and deeply
moved the sympathies of the american people. sermons were preached about
spanish misdeeds; orators demanded that the cubans be sustained "in
their heroic struggle for independence"; newspapers, scouting the
ordinary forms of diplomatic negotiation, spurned mediation and demanded
intervention and war if necessary.

cuban revolutionists]

=president cleveland's policy.=--cleveland chose the way of peace. he
ordered the observance of the rule of neutrality. he declined to act on
a resolution of congress in favor of giving to the cubans the rights of
belligerents. anxious to bring order to the distracted island, he
tendered to spain the good offices of the united states as mediator in
the contest--a tender rejected by the spanish government with the broad
hint that president cleveland might be more vigorous in putting a stop
to the unlawful aid in money, arms, and supplies, afforded to the
insurgents by american sympathizers. thereupon the president returned to
the course he had marked out for himself, leaving "the public nuisance"
to his successor, president mckinley.

=republican policies.=--the republicans in 1897 found themselves in a
position to employ that "firm, vigorous, and dignified" foreign policy
which they had approved in their platform. they had declared: "the
government of spain having lost control of cuba and being unable to

protect the property or lives of resident american citizens or to comply
with its treaty obligations, we believe that the government of the
united states should actively use its influence and good offices to
restore peace and give independence to the island." the american
property in cuba to which the republicans referred in their platform
amounted by this time to more than fifty million dollars; the commerce
with the island reached more than one hundred millions annually; and the
claims of american citizens against spain for property destroyed totaled
sixteen millions. to the pleas of humanity which made such an effective
appeal to the hearts of the american people, there were thus added
practical considerations of great weight.

=president mckinley negotiates.=--in the face of the swelling tide of
popular opinion in favor of quick, drastic, and positive action,
mckinley chose first the way of diplomacy. a short time after his
inauguration he lodged with the spanish government a dignified protest
against its policies in cuba, thus opening a game of thrust and parry
with the suave ministers at madrid. the results of the exchange of
notes were the recall of the obnoxious general weyler, the appointment
of a governor-general less bloodthirsty in his methods, a change in the
policy of concentrating civilians in military camps, and finally a
promise of "home rule" for cuba. there is no doubt that the spanish
government was eager to avoid a war that could have but one outcome. the
american minister at madrid, general woodford, was convinced that firm
and patient pressure would have resulted in the final surrender of cuba
by the spanish government.

=the de lome and the _maine_ incidents.=--such a policy was defeated by
events. in february, 1898, a private letter written by senor de lome,
the spanish ambassador at washington, expressing contempt for the
president of the united states, was filched from the mails and passed
into the hands of a journalist, william r. hearst, who published it to
the world. in the excited state of american opinion, few gave heed to
the grave breach of diplomatic courtesy committed by breaking open
private correspondence. the spanish government was compelled to recall
de lome, thus officially condemning his conduct.

at this point a far more serious crisis put the pacific relations of the
two negotiating countries in dire peril. on february 15, the battleship
_maine_, riding in the harbor of havana, was blown up and sunk, carrying
to death two officers and two hundred and fifty-eight members of the
crew. this tragedy, ascribed by the american public to the malevolence
of spanish officials, profoundly stirred an already furious nation.
when, on march 21, a commission of inquiry reported that the ill-fated
ship had been blown up by a submarine mine which had in turn set off
some of the ship's magazines, the worst suspicions seemed confirmed. if
any one was inclined to be indifferent to the cuban war for
independence, he was now met by the vehement cry: "remember the
_maine_!"

=spanish concessions.=--still the state department, under mckinley's
steady hand, pursued the path of negotiation, spain proving more pliable
and more ready with promises of reform in the island. early in april,
however, there came a decided change in the tenor of american diplomacy.
on the 4th, mckinley, evidently convinced that promises did not mean
performances, instructed our minister at madrid to warn the spanish
government that as no effective armistice had been offered to the
cubans, he would lay the whole matter before congress. this decision,
every one knew, from the temper of congress, meant war--a prospect which
excited all the european powers. the pope took an active interest in the
crisis. france and germany, foreseeing from long experience in world
politics an increase of american power and prestige through war, sought
to prevent it. spain, hopeless and conscious of her weakness, at last
dispatched to the president a note promising to suspend hostilities, to
call a cuban parliament, and to grant all the autonomy that could be
reasonably asked.

=president mckinley calls for war.=--for reasons of his own--reasons
which have never yet been fully explained--mckinley ignored the final
program of concessions presented by spain. at the very moment when his
patient negotiations seemed to bear full fruit, he veered sharply from
his course and launched the country into the war by sending to congress
his militant message of april 11, 1898. without making public the last
note he had received from spain, he declared that he was brought to the
end of his effort and the cause was in the hands of congress. humanity,
the protection of american citizens and property, the injuries to
american commerce and business, the inability of spain to bring about
permanent peace in the island--these were the grounds for action that
induced him to ask for authority to employ military and naval forces in
establishing a stable government in cuba. they were sufficient for a
public already straining at the leash.

=the resolution of congress.=--there was no doubt of the outcome when
the issue was withdrawn from diplomacy and placed in charge of congress.
resolutions were soon introduced into the house of representatives
authorizing the president to employ armed force in securing peace and
order in the island and "establishing by the free action of the people
thereof a stable and independent government of their own." to the form
and spirit of this proposal the democrats and populists took exception.
in the senate, where they were stronger, their position had to be
reckoned with by the narrow republican majority. as the resolution
finally read, the independence of cuba was recognized; spain was called
upon to relinquish her authority and withdraw from the island; and the
president was empowered to use force to the extent necessary to carry
the resolutions into effect. furthermore the united states disclaimed
"any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or
control over said island except for the pacification thereof." final
action was taken by congress on april 19, 1898, and approved by the
president on the following day.

=war and victory.=--startling events then followed in swift succession.
the navy, as a result in no small measure of the alertness of theodore
roosevelt, assistant secretary of the department, was ready for the
trial by battle. on may 1, commodore dewey at manila bay shattered the
spanish fleet, marking the doom of spanish dominion in the philippines.
on july 3, the spanish fleet under admiral cervera, in attempting to
escape from havana, was utterly destroyed by american forces under
commodore schley. on july 17, santiago, invested by american troops
under general shafter and shelled by the american ships, gave up the
struggle. on july 25 general miles landed in porto rico. on august 13,
general merritt and admiral dewey carried manila by storm. the war was
over.

=the peace protocol.=--spain had already taken cognizance of stern
facts. as early as july 26, 1898, acting through the french ambassador,
m. cambon, the madrid government approached president mckinley for a
statement of the terms on which hostilities could be brought to a close.
after some skirmishing spain yielded reluctantly to the ultimatum. on
august 12, the preliminary peace protocol was signed, stipulating that
cuba should be free, porto rico ceded to the united states, and manila
occupied by american troops pending the formal treaty of peace. on
october 1, the commissioners of the two countries met at paris to bring
about the final settlement.

=peace negotiations.=--when the day for the first session of the
conference arrived, the government at washington apparently had not made
up its mind on the final disposition of the philippines. perhaps, before
the battle of manila bay, not ten thousand people in the united states
knew or cared where the philippines were. certainly there was in the
autumn of 1898 no decided opinion as to what should be done with the
fruits of dewey's victory. president mckinley doubtless voiced the
sentiment of the people when he stated to the peace commissioners on the
eve of their departure that there had originally been no thought of
conquest in the pacific.

the march of events, he added, had imposed new duties on the country.
"incidental to our tenure in the philippines," he said, "is the
commercial opportunity to which american statesmanship cannot be
indifferent. it is just to use every legitimate means for the
enlargement of american trade." on this ground he directed the
commissioners to accept not less than the cession of the island of
luzon, the chief of the philippine group, with its harbor of manila. it
was not until the latter part of october that he definitely instructed
them to demand the entire archipelago, on the theory that the occupation
of luzon alone could not be justified "on political, commercial, or
humanitarian grounds." this departure from the letter of the peace
protocol was bitterly resented by the spanish agents. it was with
heaviness of heart that they surrendered the last sign of spain's
ancient dominion in the far pacific.

=the final terms of peace.=--the treaty of peace, as finally agreed
upon, embraced the following terms: the independence of cuba; the
cession of porto rico, guam, and the philippines to the united states;
the settlement of claims filed by the citizens of both countries; the
payment of twenty million dollars to spain by the united states for the
philippines; and the determination of the status of the inhabitants of
the ceded territories by congress. the great decision had been made. its
issue was in the hands of the senate where the democrats and the
populists held the balance of power under the requirement of the
two-thirds vote for ratification.

=the contest in america over the treaty of peace.=--the publication of
the treaty committing the united states to the administration of distant
colonies directed the shifting tides of public opinion into two distinct
channels: support of the policy and opposition to it. the trend in
republican leadership, long in the direction marked out by the treaty,
now came into the open. perhaps a majority of the men highest in the
councils of that party had undergone the change of heart reflected in
the letters of john hay, secretary of state. in august of 1898 he had
hinted, in a friendly letter to andrew carnegie, that he sympathized
with the latter's opposition to "imperialism"; but he had added quickly:
"the only question in my mind is how far it is now possible for us to
withdraw from the philippines." in november of the same year he wrote to
whitelaw reid, one of the peace commissioners at paris: "there is a wild
and frantic attack now going on in the press against the whole
philippine transaction. andrew carnegie really seems to be off his
head.... but all this confusion of tongues will go its way. the country
will applaud the resolution that has been reached and you will return in
the role of conquering heroes with your 'brows bound with oak.'"

senator beveridge of indiana and senator platt of connecticut, accepting
the verdict of history as the proof of manifest destiny, called for
unquestioning support of the administration in its final step. "every
expansion of our territory," said the latter, "has been in accordance
with the irresistible law of growth. we could no more resist the
successive expansions by which we have grown to be the strongest nation
on earth than a tree can resist its growth. the history of territorial
expansion is the history of our nation's progress and glory. it is a
matter to be proud of, not to lament. we should rejoice that providence
has given us the opportunity to extend our influence, our institutions,
and our civilization into regions hitherto closed to us, rather than
contrive how we can thwart its designs."

this doctrine was savagely attacked by opponents of mckinley's policy,
many a stanch republican joining with the majority of democrats in
denouncing the treaty as a departure from the ideals of the republic.
senator vest introduced in the senate a resolution that "under the
constitution of the united states, no power is given to the federal
government to acquire territory to be held and governed permanently as
colonies." senator hoar, of massachusetts, whose long and honorable
career gave weight to his lightest words, inveighed against the whole
procedure and to the end of his days believed that the new drift into
rivalry with european nations as a colonial power was fraught with
genuine danger. "our imperialistic friends," he said, "seem to have
forgotten the use of the vocabulary of liberty. they talk about giving
good government. 'we shall give them such a government as we think they
are fitted for.' 'we shall give them a better government than they had
before.' why, mr. president, that one phrase conveys to a free man and a
free people the most stinging of insults. in that little phrase, as in a
seed, is contained the germ of all despotism and of all tyranny.
government is not a gift. free government is not to be given by all the
blended powers of earth and heaven. it is a birthright. it belongs, as
our fathers said, and as their children said, as jefferson said, and as
president mckinley said, to human nature itself."

the senate, more conservative on the question of annexation than the
house of representatives composed of men freshly elected in the stirring
campaign of 1896, was deliberate about ratification of the treaty. the
democrats and populists were especially recalcitrant. mr. bryan hurried
to washington and brought his personal influence to bear in favor of
speedy action. patriotism required ratification, it was said in one
quarter. the country desires peace and the senate ought not to delay, it
was urged in another. finally, on february 6, 1899, the requisite
majority of two-thirds was mustered, many a senator who voted for the
treaty, however, sharing the misgivings of senator hoar as to the
"dangers of imperialism." indeed at the time, the senators passed a
resolution declaring that the policy to be adopted in the philippines
was still an open question, leaving to the future, in this way, the
possibility of retracing their steps.

=the attitude of england.=--the spanish war, while accomplishing the
simple objects of those who launched the nation on that course, like all
other wars, produced results wholly unforeseen. in the first place, it
exercised a profound influence on the drift of opinion among european
powers. in england, sympathy with the united states was from the first
positive and outspoken. "the state of feeling here," wrote mr. hay, then
ambassador in london, "is the best i have ever known. from every quarter
the evidences of it come to me. the royal family by habit and tradition
are most careful not to break the rules of strict neutrality, but even
among them i find nothing but hearty kindness and--so far as is
consistent with propriety--sympathy. among the political leaders on both
sides i find not only sympathy but a somewhat eager desire that 'the
other fellows' shall not seem more friendly."

joseph chamberlain, the distinguished liberal statesman, thinking no
doubt of the continental situation, said in a political address at the
very opening of the war that the next duty of englishmen "is to
establish and maintain bonds of permanent unity with our kinsmen across
the atlantic.... i even go so far as to say that, terrible as war may
be, even war would be cheaply purchased if, in a great and noble cause,
the stars and stripes and the union jack should wave together over an
anglo-saxon alliance." to the american ambassador he added
significantly that he did not "care a hang what they say about it on the
continent," which was another way of expressing the hope that the
warning to germany and france was sufficient. this friendly english
opinion, so useful to the united states when a combination of powers to
support spain was more than possible, removed all fears as to the
consequences of the war. henry adams, recalling days of humiliation in
london during the civil war, when his father was the american
ambassador, coolly remarked that it was "the sudden appearance of
germany as the grizzly terror" that "frightened england into america's
arms"; but the net result in keeping the field free for an easy triumph
of american arms was none the less appreciated in washington where,
despite outward calm, fears of european complications were never absent.


american policies in the philippines and the orient

=the filipino revolt against american rule.=--in the sphere of domestic
politics, as well as in the field of foreign relations, the outcome of
the spanish war exercised a marked influence. it introduced at once
problems of colonial administration and difficulties in adjusting trade
relations with the outlying dominions. these were furthermore
complicated in the very beginning by the outbreak of an insurrection
against american sovereignty in the philippines. the leader of the
revolt, aguinaldo, had been invited to join the american forces in
overthrowing spanish dominion, and he had assumed, apparently without
warrant, that independence would be the result of the joint operations.
when the news reached him that the american flag had been substituted
for the spanish flag, his resentment was keen. in february, 1899, there
occurred a slight collision between his men and some american soldiers.
the conflict thus begun was followed by serious fighting which finally
dwindled into a vexatious guerrilla warfare lasting three years and
costing heavily in men and money. atrocities were committed by the
native insurrectionists and, sad to relate, they were repaid in kind;
it was argued in defense of the army that the ordinary rules of warfare
were without terror to men accustomed to fighting like savages. in vain
did mckinley assure the filipinos that the institutions and laws
established in the islands would be designed "not for our satisfaction
or for the expression of our theoretical views, but for the happiness,
peace, and prosperity of the people of the philippine islands." nothing
short of military pressure could bring the warring revolutionists to
terms.

=attacks on republican "imperialism."=--the filipino insurrection,
following so quickly upon the ratification of the treaty with spain,
moved the american opponents of mckinley's colonial policies to redouble
their denunciation of what they were pleased to call "imperialism."
senator hoar was more than usually caustic in his indictment of the new
course. the revolt against american rule did but convince him of the
folly hidden in the first fateful measures. everywhere he saw a
conspiracy of silence and injustice. "i have failed to discover in the
speeches, public or private, of the advocates of this war," he contended
in the senate, "or in the press which supports it and them, a single
expression anywhere of a desire to do justice to the people of the
philippine islands, or of a desire to make known to the people of the
united states the truth of the case.... the catchwords, the cries, the
pithy and pregnant phrases of which their speech is full, all mean
dominion. they mean perpetual dominion.... there is not one of these
gentlemen who will rise in his place and affirm that if he were a
filipino he would not do exactly as the filipinos are doing; that he
would not despise them if they were to do otherwise. so much at least
they owe of respect to the dead and buried history--the dead and buried
history so far as they can slay and bury it--of their country." in the
way of practical suggestions, the senator offered as a solution of the
problem: the recognition of independence, assistance in establishing
self-government, and an invitation to all powers to join in a guarantee
of freedom to the islands.

=the republican answer.=--to mckinley and his supporters, engaged in a
sanguinary struggle to maintain american supremacy, such talk was more
than quixotic; it was scarcely short of treasonable. they pointed out
the practical obstacles in the way of uniform self-government for a
collection of seven million people ranging in civilization from the most
ignorant hill men to the highly cultivated inhabitants of manila. the
incidents of the revolt and its repression, they admitted, were painful
enough; but still nothing as compared with the chaos that would follow
the attempt of a people who had never had experience in such matters to
set up and sustain democratic institutions. they preferred rather the
gradual process of fitting the inhabitants of the islands for
self-government. this course, in their eyes, though less poetic, was
more in harmony with the ideals of humanity. having set out upon it,
they pursued it steadfastly to the end. first, they applied force
without stint to the suppression of the revolt. then they devoted such
genius for colonial administration as they could command to the
development of civil government, commerce, and industry.

a philippine home]

=the boxer rebellion in china.=--for a nation with a world-wide trade,
steadily growing, as the progress of home industries redoubled the zeal
for new markets, isolation was obviously impossible. never was this
clearer than in 1900 when a native revolt against foreigners in china,
known as the boxer uprising, compelled the united states to join with
the powers of europe in a military expedition and a diplomatic
settlement. the boxers, a chinese association, had for some time carried
on a campaign of hatred against all aliens in the celestial empire,
calling upon the natives to rise in patriotic wrath and drive out the
foreigners who, they said, "were lacerating china like tigers." in the
summer of 1900 the revolt flamed up in deeds of cruelty. missionaries
and traders were murdered in the provinces; foreign legations were
stoned; the german ambassador, one of the most cordially despised
foreigners, was killed in the streets of peking; and to all appearances
a frightful war of extermination had begun. in the month of june nearly
five hundred men, women, and children, representing all nations, were
besieged in the british quarters in peking under constant fire of
chinese guns and in peril of a terrible death.

=intervention in china.=--nothing but the arrival of armed forces, made
up of japanese, russian, british, american, french, and german soldiers
and marines, prevented the destruction of the beleaguered aliens. when
once the foreign troops were in possession of the chinese capital,
diplomatic questions of the most delicate character arose. for more than
half a century, the imperial powers of europe had been carving up the
chinese empire, taking to themselves territory, railway concessions,
mining rights, ports, and commercial privileges at the expense of the
huge but helpless victim. the united states alone among the great
nations, while as zealous as any in the pursuit of peaceful trade, had
refrained from seizing chinese territory or ports. moreover, the
department of state had been urging european countries to treat china
with fairness, to respect her territorial integrity, and to give her
equal trading privileges with all nations.

=the american policy of the "open door."=--in the autumn of 1899,
secretary hay had addressed to london, berlin, rome, paris, tokyo, and
st. petersburg his famous note on the "open door" policy in china. in
this document he proposed that existing treaty ports and vested
interests of the several foreign countries should be respected; that
the chinese government should be permitted to extend its tariffs to all
ports held by alien powers except the few free ports; and that there
should be no discrimination in railway and port charges among the
citizens of foreign countries operating in the empire. to these
principles the governments addressed by mr. hay, finally acceded with
evident reluctance.

[illustration: american dominions in the pacific]

on this basis he then proposed the settlement that had to follow the
boxer uprising. "the policy of the government of the united states," he
said to the great powers, in the summer of 1900, "is to seek a solution
which may bring about permanent safety and peace to china, preserve
chinese territorial and administrative entity, protect all rights
guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international law, and
safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with
all parts of the chinese empire." this was a friendly warning to the
world that the united states would not join in a scramble to punish the
chinese by carving out more territory. "the moment we acted," said mr.
hay, "the rest of the world paused and finally came over to our ground;
and the german government, which is generally brutal but seldom silly,
recovered its senses, and climbed down off its perch."

in taking this position, the secretary of state did but reflect the
common sense of america. "we are, of course," he explained, "opposed to
the dismemberment of that empire and we do not think that the public
opinion of the united states would justify this government in taking
part in the great game of spoliation now going on." heavy damages were
collected by the european powers from china for the injuries inflicted
upon their citizens by the boxers; but the united states, finding the
sum awarded in excess of the legitimate claims, returned the balance in
the form of a fund to be applied to the education of chinese students in
american universities. "i would rather be, i think," said mr. hay, "the
dupe of china than the chum of the kaiser." by pursuing a liberal
policy, he strengthened the hold of the united states upon the
affections of the chinese people and, in the long run, as he remarked
himself, safeguarded "our great commercial interests in that empire."

=imperialism in the presidential campaign of 1900.=--it is not strange
that the policy pursued by the republican administration in disposing of
the questions raised by the spanish war became one of the first issues
in the presidential campaign of 1900. anticipating attacks from every
quarter, the republicans, in renominating mckinley, set forth their
position in clear and ringing phrases: "in accepting by the treaty of
paris the just responsibility of our victories in the spanish war the
president and senate won the undoubted approval of the american people.
no other course was possible than to destroy spain's sovereignty
throughout the west indies and in the philippine islands. that course
created our responsibility, before the world and with the unorganized
population whom our intervention had freed from spain, to provide for
the maintenance of law and order, and for the establishment of good
government and for the performance of international obligations. our
authority could not be less than our responsibility, and wherever
sovereign rights were extended it became the high duty of the government
to maintain its authority, to put down armed insurrection, and to confer
the blessings of liberty and civilization upon all the rescued peoples.
the largest measure of self-government consistent with their welfare and
our duties shall be secured to them by law." to give more strength to
their ticket, the republican convention, in a whirlwind of enthusiasm,
nominated for the vice presidency, against his protest, theodore
roosevelt, the governor of new york and the hero of the rough riders, so
popular on account of their cuban campaign.

the democrats, as expected, picked up the gauntlet thrown down with such
defiance by the republicans. mr. bryan, whom they selected as their
candidate, still clung to the currency issue; but the main emphasis,
both of the platform and the appeal for votes, was on the "imperialistic
program" of the republican administration. the democrats denounced the
treatment of cuba and porto rico and condemned the philippine policy in
sharp and vigorous terms. "as we are not willing," ran the platform, "to
surrender our civilization or to convert the republic into an empire, we
favor an immediate declaration of the nation's purpose to give to the
filipinos, first, a stable form of government; second, independence;
third, protection from outside interference.... the greedy commercialism
which dictated the philippine policy of the republican administration
attempts to justify it with the plea that it will pay, but even this
sordid and unworthy plea fails when brought to the test of facts. the
war of 'criminal aggression' against the filipinos entailing an annual
expense of many millions has already cost more than any possible profit
that could accrue from the entire philippine trade for years to come....
we oppose militarism. it means conquest abroad and intimidation and
oppression at home. it means the strong arm which has ever been fatal to
free institutions. it is what millions of our citizens have fled from in
europe. it will impose upon our peace-loving people a large standing
army, an unnecessary burden of taxation, and would be a constant menace
to their liberties." such was the tenor of their appeal to the voters.

with the issues clearly joined, the country rejected the democratic
candidate even more positively than four years before. the popular vote
cast for mckinley was larger and that cast for bryan smaller than in the
silver election. thus vindicated at the polls, mckinley turned with
renewed confidence to the development of the policies he had so far
advanced. but fate cut short his designs. in the september following his
second inauguration, he was shot by an anarchist while attending the
buffalo exposition. "what a strange and tragic fate it has been of
mine," wrote the secretary of state, john hay, on the day of the
president's death, "to stand by the bier of three of my dearest friends,
lincoln, garfield, and mckinley, three of the gentlest of men, all risen
to the head of the state and all done to death by assassins." on
september 14, 1901, the vice president, theodore roosevelt, took up the
lines of power that had fallen from the hands of his distinguished
chief, promising to continue "absolutely unbroken" the policies he had
inherited.


summary of national growth and world politics

the economic aspects of the period between 1865 and 1900 may be readily
summed up: the recovery of the south from the ruin of the civil war, the
extension of the railways, the development of the great west, and the
triumph of industry and business enterprise. in the south many of the
great plantations were broken up and sold in small farms, crops were
diversified, the small farming class was raised in the scale of social
importance, the cotton industry was launched, and the coal, iron,
timber, and other resources were brought into use. in the west the free
arable land was practically exhausted by 1890 under the terms of the
homestead act; gold, silver, copper, coal and other minerals were
discovered in abundance; numerous rail connections were formed with the
atlantic seaboard; the cowboy and the indian were swept away before a
standardized civilization of electric lights and bathtubs. by the end of
the century the american frontier had disappeared. the wild, primitive
life so long associated with america was gone. the unity of the nation
was established.

in the field of business enterprise, progress was most marked. the
industrial system, which had risen and flourished before the civil war,
grew into immense proportions and the industrial area was extended from
the northeast into all parts of the country. small business concerns
were transformed into huge corporations. individual plants were merged
under the management of gigantic trusts. short railway lines were
consolidated into national systems. the industrial population of
wage-earners rose into the tens of millions. the immigration of aliens
increased by leaps and bounds. the cities overshadowed the country. the
nation that had once depended upon europe for most of its manufactured
goods became a competitor of europe in the markets of the earth.

in the sphere of politics, the period witnessed the recovery of white
supremacy in the south; the continued discussion of the old questions,
such as the currency, the tariff, and national banking; and the
injection of new issues like the trusts and labor problems. as of old,
foreign affairs were kept well at the front. alaska was purchased from
russia; attempts were made to extend american influence in the caribbean
region; a samoan island was brought under the flag; and the hawaiian
islands were annexed. the monroe doctrine was applied with vigor in the
dispute between venezuela and great britain.

assistance was given to the cubans in their revolutionary struggle
against spain and thus there was precipitated a war which ended in the
annexation of porto rico and the philippines. american influence in the
pacific and the orient was so enlarged as to be a factor of great weight
in world affairs. thus questions connected with foreign and "imperial"
policies were united with domestic issues to make up the warp and woof
of politics. in the direction of affairs, the republicans took the
leadership, for they held the presidency during all the years, except
eight, between 1865 and 1900.

chapter xxi

the evolution of republican policies (1901-13)


=the personality and early career of roosevelt.=--on september 14, 1901,
when theodore roosevelt took the oath of office, the presidency passed
to a new generation and a leader of a new type recalling, if comparisons
must be made, andrew jackson rather than any republican predecessor.
roosevelt was brusque, hearty, restless, and fond of action--"a young
fellow of infinite dash and originality," as john hay remarked of him;
combining the spirit of his old college, harvard, with the breezy
freedom of the plains; interested in everything--a new species of game,
a new book, a diplomatic riddle, or a novel theory of history or
biology. though only forty-three years old he was well versed in the art
of practical politics. coming upon the political scene in the early
eighties, he had associated himself with the reformers in the republican
party; but he was no mugwump. from the first he vehemently preached the
doctrine of party loyalty; if beaten in the convention, he voted the
straight ticket in the election. for twenty years he adhered to this
rule and during a considerable portion of that period he held office as
a spokesman of his party. he served in the new york legislature, as head
of the metropolitan police force, as federal civil service commissioner
under president harrison, as assistant secretary of the navy under
president mckinley, and as governor of the empire state. political
managers of the old school spoke of him as "brilliant but erratic"; they
soon found him equal to the shrewdest in negotiation and action.

foreign affairs

=the panama canal.=--the most important foreign question confronting
president roosevelt on the day of his inauguration, that of the panama
canal, was a heritage from his predecessor. the idea of a water route
across the isthmus, long a dream of navigators, had become a living
issue after the historic voyage of the battleship _oregon_ around south
america during the spanish war. but before the united states could act
it had to undo the clayton-bulwer treaty, made with great britain in
1850, providing for the construction of the canal under joint
supervision. this was finally effected by the hay-pauncefote treaty of
1901 authorizing the united states to proceed alone, on condition that
there should be no discriminations against other nations in the matter
of rates and charges.

this accomplished, it was necessary to decide just where the canal
should be built. one group in congress favored the route through
nicaragua; in fact, two official commissions had already approved that
location. another group favored cutting the way through panama after
purchasing the rights of the old french company which, under the
direction of de lesseps, the hero of the suez canal, had made a costly
failure some twenty years before. after a heated argument over the
merits of the two plans, preference was given to the panama route. as
the isthmus was then a part of colombia, president roosevelt proceeded
to negotiate with the government at bogota a treaty authorizing the
united states to cut a canal through its territory. the treaty was
easily framed, but it was rejected by the colombian senate, much to the
president's exasperation. "you could no more make an agreement with the
colombian rulers," he exclaimed, "than you could nail jelly to a wall."
he was spared the necessity by a timely revolution. on november 3, 1903,
panama renounced its allegiance to colombia and three days later the
united states recognized its independence.

right and contractor's hill on left. june, 1913]

this amazing incident was followed shortly by the signature of a treaty
between panama and the united states in which the latter secured the
right to construct the long-discussed canal, in return for a guarantee
of independence and certain cash payments. the rights and property of
the french concern were then bought, and the final details settled. a
lock rather than a sea-level canal was agreed upon. construction by the
government directly instead of by private contractors was adopted.
scientific medicine was summoned to stamp out the tropical diseases
that had made panama a plague spot. finally, in 1904, as the president
said, "the dirt began to fly." after surmounting formidable
difficulties--engineering, labor, and sanitary--the american forces in
1913 joined the waters of the atlantic and the pacific. nearly eight
thousand miles were cut off the sea voyage from new york to san
francisco. if any were inclined to criticize president roosevelt for
the way in which he snapped off negotiations with colombia and
recognized the panama revolutionists, their attention was drawn to the
magnificent outcome of the affair. notwithstanding the treaty with great
britain, congress passed a tolls bill discriminating in rates in favor
of american ships. it was only on the urgent insistence of president
wilson that the measure was later repealed.

=the conclusion of the russo-japanese war.=--the applause which greeted
the president's next diplomatic stroke was unmarred by censure of any
kind. in the winter of 1904 there broke out between japan and russia a
terrible conflict over the division of spoils in manchuria. the fortunes
of war were with the agile forces of nippon. in this struggle, it seems,
president roosevelt's sympathies were mainly with the japanese, although
he observed the proprieties of neutrality. at all events, secretary hay
wrote in his diary on new year's day, 1905, that the president was
"quite firm in his view that we cannot permit japan to be robbed a
second time of her victory," referring to the fact that japan, ten years
before, after defeating china on the field of battle, had been forced by
russia, germany, and france to forego the fruits of conquest.

whatever the president's personal feelings may have been, he was aware
that japan, despite her triumphs over russia, was staggering under a
heavy burden of debt. at a suggestion from tokyo, he invited both
belligerents in the summer of 1905 to join in a peace conference. the
celerity of their reply was aided by the pressure of european bankers,
who had already come to a substantial agreement that the war must stop.
after some delay, portsmouth, new hampshire, was chosen as the meeting
place for the spokesmen of the two warring powers. roosevelt presided
over the opening ceremonies with fine urbanity, thoroughly enjoying the
justly earned honor of being for the moment at the center of the world's
interest. he had the satisfaction of seeing the conference end in a
treaty of peace and amity.

=the monroe doctrine applied to germany.=--less spectacular than the
russo-japanese settlement but not less important was a diplomatic
passage-at-arms with germany over the monroe doctrine. this clash grew
out of the inability or unwillingness of the venezuelan government to
pay debts due foreign creditors. having exhausted their patience in
negotiations, england and germany, in december 1901, sent battleships to
establish what they characterized as "a peaceful blockade" of venezuelan
ports. their action was followed by the rupture of diplomatic relations;
there was a possibility that war and the occupation of venezuelan
territory might result.

while unwilling to stand between a latin-american country and its
creditors, president roosevelt was determined that debt collecting
should not be made an excuse for european countries to seize territory.
he therefore urged arbitration of the dispute, winning the assent of
england and italy. germany, with a somewhat haughty air, refused to take
the milder course. the president, learning of this refusal, called the
german ambassador to the white house and informed him in very precise
terms that, unless the imperial german government consented to
arbitrate, admiral dewey would be ordered to the scene with instructions
to prevent germany from seizing any venezuelan territory. a week passed
and no answer came from berlin. not baffled, the president again took
the matter up with the ambassador, this time with even more firmness; he
stated in language admitting of but one meaning that, unless within
forty-eight hours the emperor consented to arbitration, american
battleships, already coaled and cleared, would sail for venezuelan
waters. the hint was sufficient. the kaiser accepted the proposal and
the president, with the fine irony of diplomacy, complimented him
publicly on "being so stanch an advocate of arbitration." in terms of
the monroe doctrine this action meant that the united states, while not
denying the obligations of debtors, would not permit any move on the
part of european powers that might easily lead to the temporary or
permanent occupation of latin-american territory.

=the santo domingo affair.=--the same issue was involved in a
controversy over santo domingo which arose in 1904. the dominican
republic, like venezuela, was heavily in debt, and certain european
countries declared that, unless the united states undertook to look
after the finances of the embarrassed debtor, they would resort to armed
coercion. what was the united states to do? the danger of having some
european power strongly intrenched in santo domingo was too imminent to
be denied. president roosevelt acted with characteristic speed, and
notwithstanding strong opposition in the senate was able, in 1907, to
effect a treaty arrangement which placed dominican finances under
american supervision.

in the course of the debate over this settlement, a number of
interesting questions arose. it was pertinently asked whether the
american navy should be used to help creditors collect their debts
anywhere in latin-america. it was suggested also that no sanction should
be given to the practice among european governments of using armed force
to collect private claims. opponents of president roosevelt's policy,
and they were neither few nor insignificant, urged that such matters
should be referred to the hague court or to special international
commissions for arbitration. to this the answer was made that the united
states could not surrender any question coming under the terms of the
monroe doctrine to the decision of an international tribunal. the
position of the administration was very clearly stated by president
roosevelt himself. "the country," he said, "would certainly decline to
go to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a just debt;
on the other hand, it is very inadvisable to permit any foreign power to
take possession, even temporarily, of the customs houses of an american
republic in order to enforce the payment of its obligations; for such a
temporary occupation might turn into a permanent occupation. the only
escape from these alternatives may at any time be that we must
ourselves undertake to bring about some arrangement by which so much as
possible of a just obligation shall be paid." the monroe doctrine was
negative. it denied to european powers a certain liberty of operation in
this hemisphere. the positive obligations resulting from its application
by the united states were points now emphasized and developed.

=the hague conference.=--the controversies over latin-american relations
and his part in bringing the russo-japanese war to a close naturally
made a deep impression upon roosevelt, turning his mind in the direction
of the peaceful settlement of international disputes. the subject was
moreover in the air. as if conscious of impending calamity, the
statesmen of the old world, to all outward signs at least, seemed
searching for a way to reduce armaments and avoid the bloody and costly
trial of international causes by the ancient process of battle. it was
the czar, nicholas ii, fated to die in one of the terrible holocausts
which he helped to bring upon mankind, who summoned the delegates of the
nations in the first hague peace conference in 1899. the conference did
nothing to reduce military burdens or avoid wars but it did recognize
the right of friendly nations to offer the services of mediation to
countries at war and did establish a court at the hague for the
arbitration of international disputes.

encouraged by this experiment, feeble as it was, president roosevelt in
1904 proposed a second conference, yielding to the czar the honor of
issuing the call. at this great international assembly, held at the
hague in 1907, the representatives of the united states proposed a plan
for the compulsory arbitration of certain matters of international
dispute. this was rejected with contempt by germany. reduction of
armaments, likewise proposed in the conference, was again deferred. in
fact, nothing was accomplished beyond agreement upon certain rules for
the conduct of "civilized warfare," casting a somewhat lurid light upon
the "pacific" intentions of most of the powers assembled.

=the world tour of the fleet.=--as if to assure the world then that the
united states placed little reliance upon the frail reed of peace
conferences, roosevelt the following year (1908) made an imposing
display of american naval power by sending a fleet of sixteen
battleships on a tour around the globe. on his own authority, he ordered
the ships to sail out of hampton roads and circle the earth by way of
the straits of magellan, san francisco, australia, the philippines,
china, japan, and the suez canal. this enterprise was not, as some
critics claimed, a "mere boyish flourish." president roosevelt knew how
deep was the influence of sea power on the fate of nations. he was aware
that no country could have a wide empire of trade and dominion without
force adequate to sustain it. the voyage around the world therefore
served a double purpose. it interested his own country in the naval
program of the government, and it reminded other powers that the
american giant, though quiet, was not sleeping in the midst of
international rivalries.


colonial administration

=a constitutional question settled.=--in colonial administration, as in
foreign policy, president roosevelt advanced with firm step in a path
already marked out. president mckinley had defined the principles that
were to control the development of porto rico and the philippines. the
republican party had announced a program of pacification, gradual
self-government, and commercial improvement. the only remaining question
of importance, to use the popular phrase,--"does the constitution follow
the flag?"--had been answered by the supreme court of the united states.
although it was well known that the constitution did not contemplate the
government of dependencies, such as the philippines and porto rico, the
court, by generous and ingenious interpretations, found a way for
congress to apply any reasonable rules required by the occasion.

=porto rico.=--the government of porto rico was a relatively simple
matter. it was a single island with a fairly homogeneous population
apart from the spanish upper class. for a time after military occupation
in 1898, it was administered under military rule. this was succeeded by
the establishment of civil government under the "organic act" passed by
congress in 1900. the law assured to the porto ricans american
protection but withheld american citizenship--a boon finally granted in
1917. it provided for a governor and six executive secretaries appointed
by the president with the approval of the senate; and for a legislature
of two houses--one elected by popular native vote, and an upper chamber
composed of the executive secretaries and five other persons appointed
in the same manner. thus the united states turned back to the provincial
system maintained by england in virginia or new york in old colonial
days. the natives were given a voice in their government and the power
of initiating laws; but the final word both in law-making and
administration was vested in officers appointed in washington. such was
the plan under which the affairs of porto rico were conducted by
president roosevelt. it lasted until the new organic act of 1917.

[illustration: _photograph from underwood and underwood, n.y._

=the philippines.=--the administration of the philippines presented far
more difficult questions. the number of islands, the variety of
languages and races, the differences in civilization all combined to
challenge the skill of the government. moreover, there was raging in
1901 a stubborn revolt against american authority, which had to be
faced. following the lines laid down by president mckinley, the
evolution of american policy fell into three stages. at first the
islands were governed directly by the president under his supreme
military power. in 1901 a civilian commission, headed by william howard
taft, was selected by the president and charged with the government of
the provinces in which order had been restored. six years later, under
the terms of an organic act, passed by congress in 1902, the third stage
was reached. the local government passed into the hands of a governor
and commission, appointed by the president and senate, and a
legislature--one house elected by popular vote and an upper chamber

composed of the commission. this scheme, like that obtaining in porto
rico, remained intact until a democratic congress under president
wilson's leadership carried the colonial administration into its fourth
phase by making both houses elective. thus, by the steady pursuit of a
liberal policy, self-government was extended to the dependencies; but it
encouraged rather than extinguished the vigorous movement among the
philippine natives for independence.

=cuban relations.=--within the sphere of colonial affairs, cuba, though
nominally independent, also presented problems to the government at
washington. in the fine enthusiasm that accompanied the declaration of
war on spain, congress, unmindful of practical considerations,
recognized the independence of cuba and disclaimed "any disposition or
intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said
island except for the pacification thereof." in the settlement that
followed the war, however, it was deemed undesirable to set the young
republic adrift upon the stormy sea of international politics without a
guiding hand. before withdrawing american troops from the island,
congress, in march, 1901, enacted, and required cuba to approve, a
series of restrictions known as the platt amendment, limiting her power
to incur indebtedness, securing the right of the united states to
intervene whenever necessary to protect life and property, and reserving
to the united states coaling stations at certain points to be agreed
upon. the cubans made strong protests against what they deemed
"infringements of their sovereignty"; but finally with good grace
accepted their fate. even when in 1906 president roosevelt landed
american troops in the island to quell a domestic dissension, they
acquiesced in the action, evidently regarding it as a distinct warning
that they should learn to manage their elections in an orderly manner.


the roosevelt domestic policies

=social questions to the front.=--from the day of his inauguration to
the close of his service in 1909, president roosevelt, in messages,
speeches, and interviews, kept up a lively and interesting discussion of
trusts, capital, labor, poverty, riches, lawbreaking, good citizenship,
and kindred themes. many a subject previously touched upon only by
representatives of the minor and dissenting parties, he dignified by a
careful examination. that he did this with any fixed design or policy in
mind does not seem to be the case. he admitted himself that when he
became president he did not have in hand any settled or far-reaching
plan of social betterment. he did have, however, serious convictions on
general principles. "i was bent upon making the government," he wrote,
"the most efficient possible instrument in helping the people of the
united states to better themselves in every way, politically, socially,
and industrially. i believed with all my heart in real and
thorough-going democracy and i wished to make the democracy industrial
as well as political, although i had only partially formulated the
method i believed we should follow." it is thus evident at least that he
had departed a long way from the old idea of the government as nothing
but a great policeman keeping order among the people in a struggle over
the distribution of the nation's wealth and resources.

=roosevelt's view of the constitution.=--equally significant was
roosevelt's attitude toward the constitution and the office of
president. he utterly repudiated the narrow construction of our national
charter. he held that the constitution "should be treated as the
greatest document ever devised by the wit of man to aid a people in
exercising every power necessary for its own betterment, not as a
strait-jacket cunningly fashioned to strangle growth." he viewed the
presidency as he did the constitution. strict constructionists of the
jeffersonian school, of whom there were many on occasion even in the
republican party, had taken a view that the president could do nothing
that he was not specifically authorized by the constitution to do.
roosevelt took exactly the opposite position. it was his opinion that it
was not only the president's right but his duty "to do anything that the
needs of the nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the
constitution or the laws." he went on to say that he acted "for the
common well-being of all our people whenever and in whatever manner was
necessary, unless prevented by direct constitutional or legislative
prohibition."

=the trusts and railways.=--to the trust question, roosevelt devoted
especial attention. this was unavoidable. by far the larger part of the
business of the country was done by corporations as distinguished from
partnerships and individual owners. the growth of these gigantic
aggregations of capital had been the leading feature in american
industrial development during the last two decades of the nineteenth
century. in the conquest of business by trusts and "the resulting
private fortunes of great magnitude," the populists and the democrats
had seen a grievous danger to the republic. "plutocracy has taken the
place of democracy; the tariff breeds trusts; let us destroy therefore
the tariff and the trusts"--such was the battle cry which had been taken
up by bryan and his followers.

president roosevelt countered vigorously. he rejected the idea that the
trusts were the product of the tariff or of governmental action of any
kind. he insisted that they were the outcome of "natural economic
forces": (1) destructive competition among business men compelling them
to avoid ruin by cooperation in fixing prices; (2) the growth of markets
on a national scale and even international scale calling for vast
accumulations of capital to carry on such business; (3) the possibility
of immense savings by the union of many plants under one management. in
the corporation he saw a new stage in the development of american
industry. unregulated competition he regarded as "the source of evils
which all men concede must be remedied if this civilization of ours is
to survive." the notion, therefore, that these immense business concerns
should be or could be broken up by a decree of law, roosevelt considered
absurd.

at the same time he proposed that "evil trusts" should be prevented from
"wrong-doing of any kind"; that is, punished for plain swindling, for
making agreements to limit output, for refusing to sell to customers who
dealt with rival firms, and for conspiracies with railways to ruin
competitors by charging high freight rates and for similar abuses.
accordingly, he proposed, not the destruction of the trusts, but their
regulation by the government. this, he contended, would preserve the
advantages of business on a national scale while preventing the evils
that accompanied it. the railway company he declared to be a public
servant. "its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike."
so he answered those who thought that trusts and railway combinations
were private concerns to be managed solely by their owners without let
or hindrance and also those who thought trusts and railway combinations
could be abolished by tariff reduction or criminal prosecution.

=the labor question.=--on the labor question, then pressing to the front
in public interest, president roosevelt took advanced ground for his
time. he declared that the working-man, single-handed and empty-handed,
threatened with starvation if unemployed, was no match for the employer
who was able to bargain and wait. this led him, accordingly, to accept
the principle of the trade union; namely, that only by collective
bargaining can labor be put on a footing to measure its strength equally
with capital. while he severely arraigned labor leaders who advocated
violence and destructive doctrines, he held that "the organization of
labor into trade unions and federations is necessary, is beneficent, and
is one of the greatest possible agencies in the attainment of a true
industrial, as well as a true political, democracy in the united
states." the last resort of trade unions in labor disputes, the strike,
he approved in case negotiations failed to secure "a fair deal."

he thought, however, that labor organizations, even if wisely managed,
could not solve all the pressing social questions of the time. the aid
of the government at many points he believed to be necessary to
eliminate undeserved poverty, industrial diseases, unemployment, and the
unfortunate consequences of industrial accidents. in his first message
of 1901, for instance, he urged that workers injured in industry should
have certain and ample compensation. from time to time he advocated
other legislation to obtain what he called "a larger measure of social
and industrial justice."

=great riches and taxation.=--even the challenge of the radicals, such
as the populists, who alleged that "the toil of millions is boldly
stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few"--challenges which his
predecessors did not consider worthy of notice--president roosevelt
refused to let pass without an answer. in his first message he denied
the truth of the common saying that the rich were growing richer and the
poor were growing poorer. he asserted that, on the contrary, the average
man, wage worker, farmer, and small business man, was better off than
ever before in the history of our country. that there had been abuses in
the accumulation of wealth he did not pretend to ignore, but he believed
that even immense fortunes, on the whole, represented positive benefits
conferred upon the country. nevertheless he felt that grave dangers to
the safety and the happiness of the people lurked in great inequalities
of wealth. in 1906 he wrote that he wished it were in his power to
prevent the heaping up of enormous fortunes. the next year, to the
astonishment of many leaders in his own party, he boldly announced in a
message to congress that he approved both income and inheritance taxes,
then generally viewed as populist or democratic measures. he even took
the stand that such taxes should be laid in order to bring about a more
equitable distribution of wealth and greater equality of opportunity
among citizens.


legislative and executive activities

=economic legislation.=--when president roosevelt turned from the field
of opinion he found himself in a different sphere. many of his views
were too advanced for the members of his party in congress, and where
results depended upon the making of new laws, his progress was slow.
nevertheless, in his administrations several measures were enacted that
bore the stamp of his theories, though it could hardly be said that he
dominated congress to the same degree as did some other presidents. the
hepburn railway act of 1906 enlarged the interstate commerce commission;
it extended the commission's power over oil pipe lines, express
companies, and other interstate carriers; it gave the commission the
right to reduce rates found to be unreasonable and discriminatory; it
forbade "midnight tariffs," that is, sudden changes in rates favoring
certain shippers; and it prohibited common carriers from transporting
goods owned by themselves, especially coal, except for their own proper
use. two important pure food and drug laws, enacted during the same
year, were designed to protect the public against diseased meats and
deleterious foods and drugs. a significant piece of labor legislation
was an act of the same congress making interstate railways liable to
damages for injuries sustained by their employees. when this measure was
declared unconstitutional by the supreme court it was reenacted with the
objectionable clauses removed. a second installment of labor legislation
was offered in the law of 1908 limiting the hours of railway employees
engaged as trainmen or telegraph operators.

=reclamation and conservation.=--the open country--the deserts, the
forests, waterways, and the public lands--interested president roosevelt
no less than railway and industrial questions. indeed, in his first
message to congress he placed the conservation of natural resources
among "the most vital internal problems" of the age, and forcibly
emphasized an issue that had been discussed in a casual way since
cleveland's first administration. the suggestion evoked an immediate
response in congress. under the leadership of senator newlands, of
nevada, the reclamation act of 1902 was passed, providing for the
redemption of the desert areas of the west. the proceeds from the sale
of public lands were dedicated to the construction of storage dams and
sluiceways to hold water and divert it as needed to the thirsty sands.
furthermore it was stipulated that the rents paid by water users should
go into a reclamation fund to continue the good work forever.
construction was started immediately under the terms of the law. within
seventeen years about 1,600,000 acres had been reclaimed and more than a
million were actually irrigated. in the single year 1918, the crops of
the irrigated districts were valued at approximately $100,000,000.

in his first message, also, president roosevelt urged the transfer of
all control over national forests to trained men in the bureau of
forestry--a recommendation carried out in 1907 when the forestry service
was created. in every direction noteworthy advances were made in the
administration of the national domain. the science of forestry was
improved and knowledge of the subject spread among the people. lands in
the national forest available for agriculture were opened to settlers.
water power sites on the public domain were leased for a term of years
to private companies instead of being sold outright. the area of the
national forests was enlarged from 43 million acres to 194 million acres
by presidential proclamation--more than 43 million acres being added in
one year, 1907. the men who turned sheep and cattle to graze on the
public lands were compelled to pay a fair rental, much to their
dissatisfaction. fire prevention work was undertaken in the forests on a
large scale, reducing the appalling, annual destruction of timber.
millions of acres of coal land, such as the government had been
carelessly selling to mining companies at low figures, were withdrawn
from sale and held until congress was prepared to enact laws for the
disposition of them in the public interest. prosecutions were
instituted against men who had obtained public lands by fraud and vast
tracts were recovered for the national domain. an agitation was begun
which bore fruit under the administrations of taft and wilson in laws
reserving to the federal government the ownership of coal, water power,
phosphates, and other natural resources while authorizing corporations
to develop them under leases for a period of years.

=the prosecution of the trusts.=--as an executive, president roosevelt
was also a distinct "personality." his discrimination between "good" and
"bad" trusts led him to prosecute some of them with vigor. on his
initiative, the northern securities company, formed to obtain control of
certain great western railways, was dissolved by order of the supreme
court. proceedings were instituted against the american tobacco company
and the standard oil company as monopolies in violation of the sherman
anti-trust law. the sugar trust was found guilty of cheating the new
york customs house and some of the minor officers were sent to prison.
frauds in the post-office department were uncovered and the offenders
brought to book. in fact hardly a week passed without stirring news of
"wrong doers" and "malefactors" haled into federal courts.

=the great coal strike.=--the roosevelt theory that the president could
do anything for public welfare not forbidden by the constitution and the
laws was put to a severe test in 1902. a strike of the anthracite coal
miners, which started in the summer, ran late into the autumn.
industries were paralyzed for the want of coal; cities were threatened
with the appalling menace of a winter without heat. governors and mayors
were powerless and appealed for aid. the mine owners rejected the
demands of the men and refused to permit the arbitration of the points
in dispute, although john mitchell, the leader of the miners, repeatedly
urged it. after observing closely the course affairs, president
roosevelt made up his mind that the situation was intolerable. he
arranged to have the federal troops, if necessary, take possession of
the mines and operate them until the strike could be settled. he then
invited the contestants to the white house and by dint of hard labor
induced them to accept, as a substitute or compromise, arbitration by a
commission which he appointed. thus, by stepping outside the
constitution and acting as the first citizen of the land, president
roosevelt averted a crisis of great magnitude.

=the election of 1904.=--the views and measures which he advocated with
such vigor aroused deep hostility within as well as without his party.
there were rumors of a republican movement to defeat his nomination in
1904 and it was said that the "financial and corporation interests" were
in arms against him. a prominent republican paper in new york city
accused him of having "stolen mr. bryan's thunder," by harrying the
trusts and favoring labor unions. when the republican convention
assembled in chicago, however, the opposition disappeared and roosevelt
was nominated by acclamation.

this was the signal for a change on the part of democratic leaders. they
denounced the president as erratic, dangerous, and radical and decided
to assume the moderate role themselves. they put aside mr. bryan and
selected as their candidate, judge alton b. parker, of new york, a man

who repudiated free silver and made a direct appeal for the conservative
vote. the outcome of the reversal was astounding. judge parker's vote
fell more than a million below that cast for bryan in 1900; of the 476
electoral votes he received only 140. roosevelt, in addition to sweeping
the republican sections, even invaded democratic territory, carrying the
state of missouri. thus vindicated at the polls, he became more
outspoken than ever. his leadership in the party was so widely
recognized that he virtually selected his own successor.


the administration of president taft

=the campaign of 1908.=--long before the end of his elective term,
president roosevelt let it be known that he favored as his successor,
william howard taft, of ohio, his secretary of war. to attain this end
he used every shred of his powerful influence. when the republican
convention assembled, mr. taft easily won the nomination. though the
party platform was conservative in tone, he gave it a progressive tinge
by expressing his personal belief in the popular election of united
states senators, an income tax, and other liberal measures. president
roosevelt announced his faith in the republican candidate and appealed
to the country for his election.

the turn in republican affairs now convinced mr. bryan that the signs
were propitious for a third attempt to win the presidency. the disaster
to judge parker had taught the party that victory did not lie in a
conservative policy. with little difficulty, therefore, the veteran
leader from nebraska once more rallied the democrats around his
standard, won the nomination, and wrote a platform vigorously attacking
the tariff, trusts, and monopolies. supported by a loyal following, he
entered the lists, only to meet another defeat. though he polled almost
a million and a half more votes than did judge parker in 1904, the palm
went to mr. taft.

=the tariff revision and party dissensions.=--at the very beginning of
his term, president taft had to face the tariff issue. he had met it in
the campaign. moved by the democratic demand for a drastic reduction, he
had expressed opinions which were thought to imply a "downward
revision." the democrats made much of the implication and the
republicans from the middle west rejoiced in it. pressure was coming
from all sides. more than ten years had elapsed since the enactment of
the dingley bill and the position of many industries had been altered
with the course of time. evidently the day for revision--at best a
thankless task--had arrived. taft accepted the inevitable and called
congress in a special session. until the midsummer of 1909, republican
senators and representatives wrangled over tariff schedules, the
president making little effort to influence their decisions. when on
august 5 the payne-aldrich bill became a law, a breach had been made in
republican ranks. powerful senators from the middle west had spoken
angrily against many of the high rates imposed by the bill. they had
even broken with their party colleagues to vote against the entire
scheme of tariff revision.

=the income tax amendment.=--the rift in party harmony was widened by
another serious difference of opinion. during the debate on the tariff
bill, there was a concerted movement to include in it an income tax
provision--this in spite of the decision of the supreme court in 1895
declaring it unconstitutional. conservative men were alarmed by the
evident willingness of some members to flout a solemn decree of that
eminent tribunal. at the same time they saw a powerful combination of
republicans and democrats determined upon shifting some of the burden of
taxation to large incomes. in the press of circumstances, a compromise
was reached. the income tax bill was dropped for the present; but
congress passed the sixteenth amendment to the constitution, authorizing
taxes upon incomes from whatever source they might be derived, without
reference to any apportionment among the states on the basis of
population. the states ratified the amendment and early in 1913 it was
proclaimed.

=president taft's policies.=--after the enactment of the tariff bill,
taft continued to push forward with his legislative program. he
recommended, and congress created, a special court of commerce with
jurisdiction, among other things, over appeals from the interstate
commerce commission, thus facilitating judicial review of the railway
rates fixed and the orders issued by that body. this measure was quickly
followed by an act establishing a system of postal savings banks in
connection with the post office--a scheme which had long been opposed by
private banks. two years later, congress defied the lobby of the express
companies and supplemented the savings banks with a parcels post system,
thus enabling the american postal service to catch up with that of other
progressive nations. with a view to improving the business
administration of the federal government, the president obtained from
congress a large appropriation for an economy and efficiency commission
charged with the duty of inquiring into wasteful and obsolete methods
and recommending improved devices and practices. the chief result of
this investigation was a vigorous report in favor of a national budget
system, which soon found public backing.

president taft negotiated with england and france general treaties
providing for the arbitration of disputes which were "justiciable" in
character even though they might involve questions of "vital interest
and national honor." they were coldly received in the senate and so
amended that taft abandoned them altogether. a tariff reciprocity
agreement with canada, however, he forced through congress in the face
of strong opposition from his own party. after making a serious breach
in republican ranks, he was chagrined to see the whole scheme come to
naught by the overthrow of the liberals in the canadian elections of
1911.

=prosecution of the trusts.=--the party schism was even enlarged by what
appeared to be the successful prosecution of several great combinations.
in two important cases, the supreme court ordered the dissolution of the
standard oil company and the american tobacco company on the ground that
they violated the sherman anti-trust law. in taking this step chief
justice white was at some pains to state that the law did not apply to
combinations which did not "unduly" restrain trade. his remark,
construed to mean that the court would not interfere with corporations
as such, became the subject of a popular outcry against the president
and the judges.


progressive insurgency and the election of 1912

=growing dissensions.=--all in all, taft's administration from the first
day had been disturbed by party discord. high words had passed over the
tariff bill and disgruntled members of congress could not forget them.
to differences over issues were added quarrels between youth and old
age. in the house of representatives there developed a group of young
"insurgent" republicans who resented the dominance of the speaker,
joseph g. cannon, and other members of the "old guard," as they named
the men of long service and conservative minds. in 1910, the insurgents
went so far as to join with the democrats in a movement to break the
speaker's sway by ousting him from the rules committee and depriving him
of the power to appoint its members. the storm was brewing. in the
autumn of that year the democrats won a clear majority in the house of
representatives and began an open battle with president taft by
demanding an immediate downward revision of the tariff.

=the rise of the progressive republicans.=--preparatory to the campaign
of 1912, the dissenters within the republican party added the prefix
"progressive" to their old title and began to organize a movement to
prevent the renomination of mr. taft. as early as january 21, 1911, they
formed a progressive republican league at the home of senator la
follette of wisconsin and launched an attack on the taft measures and
policies. in october they indorsed mr. la follette as "the logical
republican candidate" and appealed to the party for support. the
controversy over the tariff had grown into a formidable revolt against
the occupant of the white house.

=roosevelt in the field.=--after looking on for a while, ex-president
roosevelt took a hand in the fray. soon after his return in 1910 from a
hunting trip in africa and a tour in europe, he made a series of
addresses in which he formulated a progressive program. in a speech in
kansas, he favored regulation of the trusts, a graduated income tax
bearing heavily on great fortunes, tariff revision schedule by schedule,
conservation of natural resources, labor legislation, the direct
primary, and the recall of elective officials. in an address before the
ohio state constitutional convention in february, 1912, he indorsed the
initiative and referendum and announced a doctrine known as the "recall
of judicial decisions." this was a new and radical note in american
politics. an ex-president of the united states proposed that the people
at the polls should have the right to reverse the decision of a judge
who set aside any act of a state legislature passed in the interests of
social welfare. the progressive republicans, impressed by these
addresses, turned from la follette to roosevelt and on february 24,
induced him to come out openly as a candidate against taft for the
republican nomination.

=the split in the republican party.=--the country then witnessed the
strange spectacle of two men who had once been close companions engaged
in a bitter rivalry to secure a majority of the delegates to the
republican convention to be held at chicago. when the convention
assembled, about one-fourth of the seats were contested, the delegates
for both candidates loudly proclaiming the regularity of their election.
in deciding between the contestants the national committee, after the
usual hearings, settled the disputes in such a way that taft received a
safe majority. after a week of negotiation, roosevelt and his followers
left the republican party. most of his supporters withdrew from the
convention and the few who remained behind refused to answer the roll
call. undisturbed by this formidable bolt, the regular republicans went
on with their work. they renominated mr. taft and put forth a platform
roundly condemning such progressive doctrines as the recall of judges.

=the formation of the progressive party.=--the action of the republicans
in seating the taft delegates was vigorously denounced by roosevelt. he
declared that the convention had no claim to represent the voters of the
republican party; that any candidate named by it would be "the
beneficiary of a successful fraud"; and that it would be deeply
discreditable to any man to accept the convention's approval under such
circumstances. the bitterness of his followers was extreme. on july 8, a
call went forth for a "progressive" convention to be held in chicago on
august 5. the assembly which duly met on that day was a unique political
conference. prominence was given to women delegates, and "politicians"
were notably absent. roosevelt himself, who was cheered as a conquering
hero, made an impassioned speech setting forth his "confession of
faith." he was nominated by acclamation; governor hiram johnson of
california was selected as his companion candidate for vice president.
the platform endorsed such political reforms as woman suffrage, direct
primaries, the initiative, referendum, and recall, popular election of
united states senators, and the short ballot. it favored a program of
social legislation, including the prohibition of child labor and minimum
wages for women. it approved the regulation, rather than the
dissolution, of the trusts. like apostles in a new and lofty cause, the
progressives entered a vigorous campaign for the election of their
distinguished leader.

=woodrow wilson and the election of 1912.=--with the republicans
divided, victory loomed up before the democrats. naturally, a terrific
contest over the nomination occurred at their convention in baltimore.
champ clark, speaker of the house of representatives, and governor
woodrow wilson, of new jersey, were the chief contestants. after tossing
to and fro for seven long, hot days, and taking forty-six ballots, the
delegates, powerfully influenced by mr. bryan, finally decided in favor
of the governor. as a professor, a writer on historical and political
subjects, and the president of princeton university, mr. wilson had
become widely known in public life. as the governor of new jersey he had
attracted the support of the progressives in both parties. with grim
determination he had "waged war on the bosses," and pushed through the
legislature measures establishing direct primaries, regulating public
utilities, and creating a system of workmen's compensation in
industries. during the presidential campaign that followed governor
wilson toured the country and aroused great enthusiasm by a series of
addresses later published under the title of _the new freedom_. he
declared that "the government of the united states is at present the
foster child of the special interests." he proposed to free the country
by breaking the dominance of "the big bankers, the big manufacturers,
the big masters of commerce, the heads of railroad corporations and of
steamship corporations."

in the election governor wilson easily secured a majority of the
electoral votes, and his party, while retaining possession of the house
of representatives, captured the senate as well. the popular verdict,
however, indicated a state of confusion in the country. the combined
progressive and republican vote exceeded that of the democrats by
1,300,000. the socialists, with eugene v. debs as their candidate again,
polled about 900,000 votes, more than double the number received four
years before. thus, as the result of an extraordinary upheaval the
republicans, after holding the office of president for sixteen years,
passed out of power, and the government of the country was intrusted to
the democrats under the leadership of a man destined to be one of the
outstanding figures of the modern age, woodrow wilson.

chapter xxii

the spirit of reform in america


an age of criticism

=attacks on abuses in american life.=--the crisis precipitated by the
progressive uprising was not a sudden and unexpected one. it had been
long in preparation. the revolt against corruption in politics which
produced the liberal republican outbreak in the seventies and the
mugwump movement of the eighties was followed by continuous criticism of
american political and economic development. from 1880 until his death
in 1892, george william curtis, as president of the civil service reform
association, kept up a running fire upon the abuses of the spoils
system. james bryce, an observant english scholar and man of affairs, in
his great work, _the american commonwealth_, published in 1888, by
picturing fearlessly the political rings and machines which dominated
the cities, gave the whole country a fresh shock. six years later henry
d. lloyd, in a powerful book entitled _wealth against commonwealth_,
attacked in scathing language certain trusts which had destroyed their
rivals and bribed public officials. in 1903 miss ida tarbell, an author
of established reputation in the historical field, gave to the public an
account of the standard oil company, revealing the ruthless methods of
that corporation in crushing competition. about the same time lincoln
steffens exposed the sordid character of politics in several
municipalities in a series of articles bearing the painful heading: _the
shame of the cities_. the critical spirit appeared in almost every form;
in weekly and monthly magazines, in essays and pamphlets, in editorials
and news stories, in novels like churchill's _coniston_ and sinclair's
_the jungle_. it became so savage and so wanton that the opening years
of the twentieth century were well named "the age of the muckrakers."

=the subjects of the criticism.=--in this outburst of invective, nothing
was spared. it was charged that each of the political parties had fallen
into the hands of professional politicians who devoted their time to
managing conventions, making platforms, nominating candidates, and
dictating to officials; in return for their "services" they sold offices
and privileges. it was alleged that mayors and councils had bargained
away for private benefit street railway and other franchises. it was
asserted that many powerful labor unions were dominated by men who
blackmailed employers. some critics specialized in descriptions of the
poverty, slums, and misery of great cities. others took up "frenzied
finance" and accused financiers of selling worthless stocks and bonds to
an innocent public. still others professed to see in the accumulations
of millionaires the downfall of our republic.

=the attack on "invisible government."=--some even maintained that the
control of public affairs had passed from the people to a sinister
minority called "the invisible government." so eminent and conservative
a statesman as the hon. elihu root lent the weight of his great name to
such an imputation. speaking of his native state, new york, he said:
"what is the government of this state? what has it been during the forty
years of my acquaintance with it? the government of the constitution?
oh, no; not half the time or half way.... from the days of fenton and
conkling and arthur and cornell and platt, from the days of david b.
hill down to the present time, the government of the state has presented
two different lines of activity: one, of the constitutional and
statutory officers of the state and the other of the party leaders; they
call them party bosses. they call the system--i don't coin the
phrase--the system they call 'invisible government.' for i don't know
how many years mr. conkling was the supreme ruler in this state. the
governor did not count, the legislature did not count, comptrollers and
secretaries of state and what not did not count. it was what mr.
conkling said, and in a great outburst of public rage he was pulled
down. then mr. platt ruled the state; for nigh upon twenty years he
ruled it. it was not the governor; it was not the legislature; it was
mr. platt. and the capital was not here [in albany]; it was at 49
broadway; mr. platt and his lieutenants. it makes no difference what
name you give, whether you call it fenton or conkling or cornell or
arthur or platt or by the names of men now living. the ruler of the
state during the greater part of the forty years of my acquaintance with
the state government has not been any man authorized by the constitution
or by law.... the party leader is elected by no one, accountable to no
one, bound by no oath of office, removable by no one."

=the nation aroused.=--with the spirit of criticism came also the spirit
of reform. the charges were usually exaggerated; often wholly false; but
there was enough truth in them to warrant renewed vigilance on the part
of american democracy. president roosevelt doubtless summed up the
sentiment of the great majority of citizens when he demanded the
punishment of wrong-doers in 1907, saying: "it makes not a particle of
difference whether these crimes are committed by a capitalist or by a
laborer, by a leading banker or manufacturer or railroad man or by a
leading representative of a labor union. swindling in stocks, corrupting
legislatures, making fortunes by the inflation of securities, by
wrecking railroads, by destroying competitors through rebates--these
forms of wrong-doing in the capitalist are far more infamous than any
ordinary form of embezzlement or forgery." the time had come, he added,
to stop "muckraking" and proceed to the constructive work of removing
the abuses that had grown up.


political reforms

=the public service.=--it was a wise comprehension of the needs of
american democracy that led the friends of reform to launch and to
sustain for more than half a century a movement to improve the public
service. on the one side they struck at the spoils system; at the right
of the politicians to use public offices as mere rewards for partisan
work. the federal civil service act of 1883 opened the way to reform by
establishing five vital principles in law: (1) admission to office, not
on the recommendation of party workers, but on the basis of competitive
examinations; (2) promotion for meritorious service of the government
rather than of parties; (3) no assessment of office holders for campaign
funds; (4) permanent tenure during good behavior; and (5) no dismissals
for political reasons. the act itself at first applied to only 14,000
federal offices, but under the constant pressure from the reformers it
was extended until in 1916 it covered nearly 300,000 employees out of an
executive force of approximately 414,000. while gaining steadily at
washington, civil service reformers carried their agitation into the
states and cities. by 1920 they were able to report ten states with
civil service commissions and the merit system well intrenched in more
than three hundred municipalities.

in excluding spoilsmen from public office, the reformers were, in a
sense, engaged in a negative work: that of "keeping the rascals out."
but there was a second and larger phase to their movement, one
constructive in character: that of getting skilled, loyal, and efficient
servants into the places of responsibility. everywhere on land and sea,
in town and country, new burdens were laid upon public officers. they
were called upon to supervise the ships sailing to and from our ports;
to inspect the water and milk supplies of our cities; to construct and
operate great public works, such as the panama and erie canals; to
regulate the complicated rates of railway companies; to safeguard health
and safety in a thousand ways; to climb the mountains to fight forest
fires; and to descend into the deeps of the earth to combat the deadly
coal gases that assail the miners. in a word, those who labored to
master the secrets and the powers of nature were summoned to the aid of
the government: chemists, engineers, architects, nurses, surgeons,
foresters--the skilled in all the sciences, arts, and crafts.

keeping rascals out was no task at all compared with the problem of
finding competent people for all the technical offices. "now," said the
reformers, "we must make attractive careers in the government work for
the best american talent; we must train those applying for admission and
increase the skill of those already in positions of trust; we must see
to it that those entering at the bottom have a chance to rise to the
top; in short, we must work for a government as skilled and efficient as
it is strong, one commanding all the wisdom and talent of america that
public welfare requires."

=the australian ballot.=--a second line of attack on the political
machines was made in connection with the ballot. in the early days
elections were frequently held in the open air and the poll was taken by
a show of hands or by the enrollment of the voters under names of their
favorite candidates. when this ancient practice was abandoned in favor
of the printed ballot, there was still no secrecy about elections. each
party prepared its own ballot, often of a distinctive color, containing
the names of its candidates. on election day, these papers were handed
out to the voters by party workers. any one could tell from the color of
the ballot dropped into the box, or from some mark on the outside of the
folded ballot, just how each man voted. those who bought votes were sure
that their purchases were "delivered." those who intimidated voters
could know when their intimidation was effective. in this way the party
ballot strengthened the party machine.

as a remedy for such abuses, reformers, learning from the experience of
australia, urged the adoption of the "australian ballot." that ballot,
though it appeared in many forms, had certain constant features. it was
official, that is, furnished by the government, not by party workers; it
contained the names of all candidates of all parties; it was given out
only in the polling places; and it was marked in secret. the first state
to introduce it was massachusetts. the year was 1888. before the end of
the century it had been adopted by nearly all the states in the union.
the salutary effect of the reform in reducing the amount of cheating
and bribery in elections was beyond all question.

=the direct primary.=--in connection with the uprising against machine
politics, came a call for the abolition of the old method of nominating
candidates by conventions. these time-honored party assemblies, which
had come down from the days of andrew jackson, were, it was said, merely
conclaves of party workers, sustained by the spoils system, and
dominated by an inner circle of bosses. the remedy offered in this case
was again "more democracy," namely, the abolition of the party
convention and the adoption of the direct primary. candidates were no
longer to be chosen by secret conferences. any member of a party was to
be allowed to run for any office, to present his name to his party by
securing signatures to a petition, and to submit his candidacy to his
fellow partisans at a direct primary--an election within the party. in
this movement governor la follette of wisconsin took the lead and his
state was the first in the union to adopt the direct primary for
state-wide purposes. the idea spread, rapidly in the west, more slowly
in the east. the public, already angered against "the bosses," grasped
eagerly at it. governor hughes in new york pressed it upon the unwilling
legislature. state after state accepted it until by 1918 rhode island,
delaware, connecticut, and new mexico were the only states that had not
bowed to the storm. still the results were disappointing and at that
very time the pendulum was beginning to swing backward.

=popular election of federal senators.=--while the movement for direct
primaries was still advancing everywhere, a demand for the popular
election of senators, usually associated with it, swept forward to
victory. under the original constitution, it had been expressly provided
that senators should be chosen by the legislatures of the states. in
practice this rule transferred the selection of senators to secret
caucuses of party members in the state legislatures. in connection with
these caucuses there had been many scandals, some direct proofs of
brazen bribery and corruption, and dark hints besides. the senate was
called by its detractors "a millionaires' club" and it was looked upon
as the "citadel of conservatism." the prescription in this case was
likewise "more democracy"--direct election of senators by popular vote.

this reform was not a new idea. it had been proposed in congress as
early as 1826. president johnson, an ardent advocate, made it the
subject of a special message in 1868 not long afterward it appeared in
congress. at last in 1893, the year after the great populist upheaval,
the house of representatives by the requisite two-thirds vote
incorporated it in an amendment to the federal constitution. again and
again it passed the house; but the senate itself was obdurate. able
senators leveled their batteries against it. mr. hoar of massachusetts
declared that it would transfer the seat of power to the "great cities
and masses of population"; that it would "overthrow the whole scheme of
the senate and in the end the whole scheme of the national constitution
as designed and established by the framers of the constitution and the
people who adopted it."

failing in the senate, advocates of popular election made a rear assault
through the states. they induced state legislatures to enact laws
requiring the nomination of candidates for the senate by the direct
primary, and then they bound the legislatures to abide by the popular
choice. nevada took the lead in 1899. shortly afterward oregon, by the
use of the initiative and referendum, practically bound legislators to
accept the popular nominee and the country witnessed the spectacle of a
republican legislature "electing" a democrat to represent the state in
the senate at washington. by 1910 three-fourths of the states had
applied the direct primary in some form to the choice of senators. men
selected by that method began to pour in upon the floors of congress;
finally in 1912 the two-thirds majority was secured for an amendment to
the federal constitution providing for the popular election of senators.
it was quickly ratified by the states. the following year it was
proclaimed in effect.

=the initiative and referendum.=--as a corrective for the evils which
had grown up in state legislatures there arose a demand for the
introduction of a swiss device known as the initiative and referendum.
the initiative permits any one to draw up a proposed bill; and, on
securing a certain number of signatures among the voters, to require the
submission of the measure to the people at an election. if the bill thus
initiated receives a sufficient majority, it becomes a law. the
referendum allows citizens who disapprove any act passed by the
legislature to get up a petition against it and thus bring about a
reference of the measure to the voters at the polls for approval or
rejection. these two practices constitute a form of "direct government."

these devices were prescribed "to restore the government to the people."
the populists favored them in their platform of 1896. mr. bryan, two
years later, made them a part of his program, and in the same year south
dakota adopted them. in 1902 oregon, after a strenuous campaign, added a
direct legislation amendment to the state constitution. within ten years
all the southwestern, mountain, and pacific states, except texas and
wyoming, had followed this example. to the east of the mississippi,
however, direct legislation met a chilly reception. by 1920 only five
states in this section had accepted it: maine, massachusetts, ohio,
michigan, and maryland, the last approving the referendum only.

=the recall.=--executive officers and judges, as well as legislatures,
had come in for their share of criticism, and it was proposed that they
should likewise be subjected to a closer scrutiny by the public. for
this purpose there was advanced a scheme known as the recall--which
permitted a certain percentage of the voters to compel any officer, at
any time during his term, to go before the people at a new election.
this feature of direct government, tried out first in the city of los
angeles, was extended to state-wide uses in oregon in 1908. it failed,
however, to capture popular imagination to the same degree as the
initiative and referendum. at the end of ten years' agitation, only ten
states, mainly in the west, had adopted it for general purposes, and
four of them did not apply it to the judges of the courts. still it was
extensively acclaimed in cities and incorporated into hundreds of
municipal laws and charters.

as a general proposition, direct government in all its forms was
bitterly opposed by men of a conservative cast of mind. it was denounced
by senator henry cabot lodge as "nothing less than a complete revolution
in the fabric of our government and in the fundamental principles upon
which that government rests." in his opinion, it promised to break down
the representative principle and "undermine and overthrow the bulwarks
of ordered liberty and individual freedom." mr. taft shared mr. lodge's
views and spoke of direct government with scorn. "votes," he exclaimed,
"are not bread ... referendums do not pay rent or furnish houses,
recalls do not furnish clothes, initiatives do not supply employment or
relieve inequalities of condition or of opportunity."

=commission government for cities.=--in the restless searching out of
evils, the management of cities early came under critical scrutiny. city
government, mr. bryce had remarked, was the one conspicuous failure in
america. this sharp thrust, though resented by some, was accepted as a
warning by others. many prescriptions were offered by doctors of the
body politic. chief among them was the idea of simplifying the city
government so that the light of public scrutiny could shine through it.
"let us elect only a few men and make them clearly responsible for the
city government!" was the new cry in municipal reform. so, many city
councils were reduced in size; one of the two houses, which several
cities had adopted in imitation of the federal government, was
abolished; and in order that the mayor could be held to account, he was
given the power to appoint all the chief officials. this made the mayor,
in some cases, the only elective city official and gave the voters a
"short ballot" containing only a few names--an idea which some proposed
to apply also to the state government.

a further step in the concentration of authority was taken in galveston,
texas, where the people, looking upon the ruin of their city wrought by
the devastating storm of 1901, and confronted by the difficult problems
of reconstruction, felt the necessity for a more businesslike management
of city affairs and instituted a new form of local administration. they
abolished the old scheme of mayor and council and vested all power in
five commissioners, one of whom, without any special prerogatives, was
assigned to the office of "mayor president." in 1908, the commission
form of government, as it was soon characterized, was adopted by des
moines, iowa. the attention of all municipal reformers was drawn to it
and it was hailed as the guarantee of a better day. by 1920, more than
four hundred cities, including memphis, spokane, birmingham, newark, and
buffalo, had adopted it. still the larger cities like new york and
chicago kept their boards of aldermen.

=the city manager plan.=--a few years' experience with commission
government revealed certain patent defects. the division of the work
among five men was frequently found to introduce dissensions and
irresponsibility. commissioners were often lacking in the technical
ability required to manage such difficult matters as fire and police
protection, public health, public works, and public utilities. some one
then proposed to carry over into city government an idea from the
business world. in that sphere the stockholders of each corporation
elect the directors and the directors, in turn, choose a business
manager to conduct the affairs of the company. it was suggested that the
city commissioners, instead of attempting to supervise the details of
the city administration, should select a manager to do this. the scheme
was put into effect in sumter, south carolina, in 1912. like the
commission plan, it became popular. within eight years more than one
hundred and fifty towns and cities had adopted it. among the larger
municipalities were dayton, springfield (ohio), akron, kalamazoo, and
phoenix. it promised to create a new public service profession, that of
city manager.


measures of economic reform

=the spirit of american reform.=--the purification of the ballot, the
restriction of the spoils system, the enlargement of direct popular
control over the organs of government were not the sole answers made by
the reformers to the critics of american institutions. nor were they the
most important. in fact, they were regarded not as ends in themselves,
but as means to serve a wider purpose. that purpose was the promotion of
the "general welfare." the concrete objects covered by that broad term
were many and varied; but they included the prevention of extortion by
railway and other corporations, the protection of public health, the
extension of education, the improvement of living conditions in the
cities, the elimination of undeserved poverty, the removal of gross
inequalities in wealth, and more equality of opportunity.

all these things involved the use of the powers of government. although
a few clung to the ancient doctrine that the government should not
interfere with private business at all, the american people at large
rejected that theory as vigorously as they rejected the doctrines of an
extreme socialism which exalts the state above the individual. leaders
representing every shade of opinion proclaimed the government an
instrument of common welfare to be used in the public interest. "we must
abandon definitely," said roosevelt, "the _laissez-faire_ theory of
political economy and fearlessly champion a system of increased
governmental control, paying no attention to the cries of worthy people
who denounce this as socialistic." this view was shared by mr. taft, who
observed: "undoubtedly the government can wisely do much more ... to
relieve the oppressed, to create greater equality of opportunity, to
make reasonable terms for labor in employment, and to furnish vocational
education." he was quick to add his caution that "there is a line beyond
which the government cannot go with any good practical results in
seeking to make men and society better."

=the regulation of railways.=--the first attempts to use the government
in a large way to control private enterprise in the public interest were
made by the northwestern states in the decade between 1870 and 1880.
charges were advanced by the farmers, particularly those organized into
granges, that the railways extorted the highest possible rates for
freight and passengers, that favoritism was shown to large shippers,
that fraudulent stocks and bonds were sold to the innocent public. it
was claimed that railways were not like other enterprises, but were
"quasi-public" concerns, like the roads and ferries, and thus subject to
government control. accordingly laws were enacted bringing the railroads
under state supervision. in some cases the state legislature fixed the
maximum rates to be charged by common carriers, and in other cases
commissions were created with the power to establish the rates after an
investigation. this legislation was at first denounced in the east as
nothing less than the "confiscation" of the railways in the interest of
the farmers. attempts to have the supreme court of the united states
declare it unconstitutional were made without avail; still a principle
was finally laid down to the effect that in fixing rates state
legislatures and commissions must permit railway companies to earn a
"fair" return on the capital invested.

in a few years the granger spirit appeared in congress. an investigation
revealed a long list of abuses committed by the railways against
shippers and travelers. the result was the interstate commerce act of
1887, which created the interstate commerce commission, forbade
discriminations in rates, and prohibited other objectionable practices
on the part of railways. this measure was loosely enforced and the
abuses against which it was directed continued almost unabated. a demand
for stricter control grew louder and louder. congress was forced to
heed. in 1903 it enacted the elkins law, forbidding railways to charge
rates other than those published, and laid penalties upon the officers
and agents of companies, who granted secret favors to shippers, and upon
shippers who accepted them. three years later a still more drastic step
was taken by the passage of the hepburn act. the interstate commerce
commission was authorized, upon complaint of some party aggrieved, and
after a public hearing, to determine whether just and reasonable rates
had been charged by the companies. in effect, the right to fix freight
and passenger rates was taken out of the hands of the owners of the
railways engaged in interstate commerce and vested in the hands of the
interstate commerce commission. thus private property to the value of
$20,000,000,000 or more was declared to be a matter of public concern
and subject to government regulation in the common interest.

=municipal utilities.=--similar problems arose in connection with the
street railways, electric light plants, and other utilities in the great
cities. in the beginning the right to construct such undertakings was
freely, and often corruptly, granted to private companies by city
councils. distressing abuses arose in connection with such practices.
many grants or franchises were made perpetual, or perhaps for a term of
999 years. the rates charged and services rendered were left largely to
the will of the companies holding the franchises. mergers or unions of
companies were common and the public was deluged with stocks and bonds
of doubtful value; bankruptcies were frequent. the connection between
the utility companies and the politicians was, to say the least, not
always in the public interest.

american ingenuity was quick to devise methods for eliminating such
evils. three lines of progress were laid out by the reformers. one group
proposed that such utilities should be subject to municipal or state
regulation, that the formation of utility companies should be under
public control, and that the issue of stocks and bonds must be approved
by public authority. in some cases state, and in other cases municipal,
commissions were created to exercise this great power over "quasi-public
corporations." wisconsin, by laws enacted in 1907, put all heat, light,
water works, telephone, and street railway companies under the
supervision of a single railway commission. other states followed this
example rapidly. by 1920 the principle of public control over municipal
utilities was accepted in nearly every section of the union.

a second line of reform appeared in the "model franchise" for utility
corporations. an illustration of this tendency was afforded by the
chicago street railway settlement of 1906. the total capital of the
company was fixed at a definite sum, its earnings were agreed upon, and
the city was given the right to buy and operate the system if it desired
to do so. in many states, about the same time, it was provided that no
franchises to utility companies could run more than twenty-five years.

a third group of reformers were satisfied with nothing short of
municipal ownership. they proposed to drive private companies entirely
out of the field and vest the ownership and management of municipal
plants in the city itself. this idea was extensively applied to electric
light and water works plants, but to street railways in only a few
cities, including san francisco and seattle. in new york the subways are
owned by the city but leased for operation.

=tenement house control.=--among the other pressing problems of the
cities was the overcrowding in houses unfit for habitation. an inquiry
in new york city made under the authority of the state in 1902 revealed
poverty, misery, slums, dirt, and disease almost beyond imagination. the
immediate answer was the enactment of a tenement house law prescribing
in great detail the size of the rooms, the air space, the light and the
sanitary arrangement for all new buildings. an immense improvement
followed and the idea was quickly taken up in other states having large
industrial centers. in 1920 new york made a further invasion of the
rights of landlords by assuring to the public "reasonable rents" for
flats and apartments.

=workmen's compensation.=--no small part of the poverty in cities was
due to the injury of wage-earners while at their trade. every year the
number of men and women killed or wounded in industry mounted higher.
under the old law, the workman or his family had to bear the loss unless
the employer had been guilty of some extraordinary negligence. even in
that case an expensive lawsuit was usually necessary to recover
"damages." in short, although employers insured their buildings and
machinery against necessary risks from fire and storm, they allowed
their employees to assume the heavy losses due to accidents. the
injustice of this, though apparent enough now, was once not generally
recognized. it was said to be unfair to make the employer pay for
injuries for which he was not personally responsible; but the argument
was overborne.

[illustration: an east side street in new york]

about 1910 there set in a decided movement in the direction of lifting
the burden of accidents from the unfortunate victims. in the first
place, laws were enacted requiring employers to pay damages in certain
amounts according to the nature of the case, no matter how the accident
occurred, as long as the injured person was not guilty of willful
negligence. by 1914 more than one-half the states had such laws. in the
second place, there developed schemes of industrial insurance in the
form of automatic grants made by state commissions to persons injured in
industries, the funds to be provided by the employers or the state or by
both. by 1917 thirty-six states had legislation of this type.

=minimum wages and mothers' pensions.=--another source of poverty,
especially among women and children, was found to be the low wages paid
for their labor. report after report showed this. in 1912 massachusetts
took a significant step in the direction of declaring the minimum wages
which might be paid to women and children. oregon, the following year,
created a commission with power to prescribe minimum wages in certain
industries, based on the cost of living, and to enforce the rates fixed.
within a short time one-third of the states had legislation of this
character. to cut away some of the evils of poverty and enable widows to
keep their homes intact and bring up their children, a device known as
mothers' pensions became popular during the second decade of the
twentieth century. at the opening of 1913 two states, colorado and
illinois, had laws authorizing the payment from public funds of definite
sums to widows with children. within four years, thirty-five states had
similar legislation.

=taxation and great fortunes.=--as a part of the campaign waged against
poverty by reformers there came a demand for heavy taxes upon great
fortunes, particularly taxes upon inheritances or estates passing to
heirs on the decease of the owners. roosevelt was an ardent champion of
this type of taxation and dwelt upon it at length in his message to
congress in 1907. "such a tax," he said, "would help to preserve a
measurable equality of opportunity for the people of the generations
growing to manhood.... our aim is to recognize what lincoln pointed out:
the fact that there are some respects in which men are obviously not
equal; but also to insist that there should be equality of self-respect
and of mutual respect, an equality of rights before the law, and at
least an approximate equality in the conditions under which each man
obtains the chance to show the stuff that is in him when compared with
his fellows."

the spirit of the new age was, therefore, one of reform, not of
revolution. it called for no evolutionary or utopian experiments, but
for the steady and progressive enactment of measures aimed at admitted
abuses and designed to accomplish tangible results in the name of public
welfare.

chapter xxiii

the new political democracy


=women in public affairs.=--the social legislation enacted in response
to the spirit of reform vitally affected women in the home and in
industry and was promoted by their organizations. where they did not
lead, they were affiliated with movements for social improvement. no
cause escaped their attention; no year passed without widening the range
of their interests. they served on committees that inquired into the
problems of the day; they appeared before legislative assemblies to
advocate remedies for the evils they discovered. by 1912 they were a
force to be reckoned with in national politics. in nine states complete
and equal suffrage had been established, and a widespread campaign for a
national suffrage amendment was in full swing. on every hand lay
evidences that their sphere had been broadened to include public
affairs. this was the culmination of forces that had long been
operating.

=a new emphasis in history.=--a movement so deeply affecting important
interests could not fail to find a place in time in the written record
of human progress. history often began as a chronicle of kings and
queens, knights and ladies, written partly to amuse and partly to
instruct the classes that appeared in its pages. with the growth of
commerce, parliaments, and international relations, politics and
diplomacy were added to such chronicles of royal and princely doings.
after the rise of democracy, industry, and organized labor, the
transactions of everyday life were deemed worthy of a place in the pages
of history. in each case history was rewritten and the past rediscovered
in the light of the new age. so it will be with the rise and growth of
women's political power. the history of their labor, their education,
their status in society, their influence on the course of events will be
explored and given its place in the general record.

it will be a history of change. the superior position which women enjoy
in america to-day is the result of a slow evolution from an almost
rightless condition in colonial times. the founders of america brought
with them the english common law. under that law, a married woman's
personal property--jewels, money, furniture, and the like--became her
husband's property; the management of her lands passed into his control.
even the wages she earned, if she worked for some one else, belonged to
him. custom, if not law, prescribed that women should not take part in
town meetings or enter into public discussions of religious questions.
indeed it is a far cry from the banishment of anne hutchinson from
massachusetts in 1637, for daring to dispute with the church fathers, to
the political conventions of 1920 in which women sat as delegates, made
nominating speeches, and served on committees. in the contrast between
these two scenes may be measured the change in the privileges of women
since the landing of the pilgrims. the account of this progress is a
narrative of individual effort on the part of women, of organizations
among them, of generous aid from sympathetic men in the long agitation
for the removal of civil and political disabilities. it is in part also
a narrative of irresistible economic change which drew women into
industry, created a leisure class, gave women wages and incomes, and
therewith economic independence.


the rise of the woman movement

=protests of colonial women.=--the republican spirit which produced
american independence was of slow and steady growth. it did not spring
up full-armed in a single night. it was, on the contrary, nourished
during a long period of time by fireside discussions as well as by
debates in the public forum. women shared that fireside sifting of
political principles and passed on the findings of that scrutiny in
letters to their friends, newspaper articles, and every form of written
word. how widespread was this potent, though not spectacular force, is
revealed in the collections of women's letters, articles, songs, dramas,
and satirical "skits" on english rule that have come down to us. in this
search into the reasons of government, some women began to take thought
about laws that excluded them from the ballot. two women at least left
their protests on record. abigail, the ingenious and witty wife of john
adams, wrote to her husband, in march, 1776, that women objected "to all
arbitrary power whether of state or males" and demanded political
privileges in the new order then being created. hannah lee corbin, the
sister of "lighthorse" harry lee, protested to her brother against the
taxation of women without representation.

[illustration: abigail adams]

=the stir among european women.=--ferment in america, in the case of
women as of men, was quickened by events in europe. in 1792, mary
wollstonecraft published in england the _vindication of the rights of
women_--a book that was destined to serve the cause of liberty among
women as the writings of locke and paine had served that of men. the
specific grievances which stirred english women were men's invasion of
women's industries, such as spinning and weaving; the denial of equal
educational opportunities; and political disabilities. in france also
the great revolution raised questionings about the status of women. the
rights of "citizenesses" as well as the rights of "citizens" were
examined by the boldest thinkers. this in turn reacted upon women in the
united states.

=leadership in america.=--the origins of the american woman movement are
to be found in the writings of a few early intellectual leaders. during
the first decades of the nineteenth century, books, articles, and
pamphlets about women came in increasing numbers from the press. lydia
maria child wrote a history of women; margaret fuller made a critical
examination of the status of women in her time; and mrs. elizabeth ellet
supplemented the older histories by showing what an important part women
had played in the american revolution.

=the struggle for education.=--along with criticism, there was carried
on a constructive struggle for better educational facilities for women
who had been from the beginning excluded from every college in the
country. in this long battle, emma willard and mary lyon led the way;
the former founded a seminary at troy, new york; and the latter made the
beginnings of mount holyoke college in massachusetts. oberlin college in
ohio, established in 1833, opened its doors to girls and from it were
graduated young students to lead in the woman movement. sarah j. hale,
who in 1827 became the editor of a "ladies' magazine," published in
boston, conducted a campaign for equal educational opportunities which
helped to bear fruit in the founding of vassar college shortly after the
civil war.

=the desire to effect reforms.=--as they came to study their own history
and their own part in civilization, women naturally became deeply
interested in all the controversies going on around them. the temperance
question made a special appeal to them and they organized to demand the
right to be heard on it. in 1846 the "daughters of temperance" formed a
secret society favoring prohibition. they dared to criticize the
churches for their indifference and were so bold as to ask that
drunkenness be made a ground for divorce.

the slavery issue even more than temperance called women into public
life. the grimke sisters of south carolina emancipated their bondmen,
and one of these sisters, exiled from charleston for her "appeal to the
christian women of the south," went north to work against the slavery
system. in 1837 the national women's anti-slavery convention met in new
york; seventy-one women delegates represented eight states. three years
later eight american women, five of them in quaker costume, attended the
world anti-slavery convention in london, much to the horror of the men,
who promptly excluded them from the sessions on the ground that it was
not fitting for women to take part in such meetings.

in other spheres of activity, especially social service, women steadily
enlarged their interest. nothing human did they consider alien to them.
they inveighed against cruel criminal laws and unsanitary prisons. they
organized poor relief and led in private philanthropy. dorothea dix
directed the movement that induced the new york legislature to establish
in 1845 a separate asylum for the criminal insane. in the same year
sarah g. bagley organized the lowell female reform association for the
purpose of reducing the long hours of labor for women, safeguarding "the
constitutions of future generations." mrs. eliza woodson farnham, matron
in sing sing penitentiary, was known throughout the nation for her
social work, especially prison reform. wherever there were misery and
suffering, women were preparing programs of relief.

=freedom of speech for women.=--in the advancement of their causes, of
whatever kind, women of necessity had to make public appeals and take
part in open meetings. here they encountered difficulties. the
appearance of women on the platform was new and strange. naturally it
was widely resented. antoinette brown, although she had credentials as a
delegate, was driven off the platform of a temperance convention in new
york city simply because she was a woman. james russell lowell, editor
of the "atlantic monthly," declined a poem from julia ward howe on the
theory that no woman could write a poem; but he added on second thought
that he might consider an article in prose. nathaniel hawthorne,
another editor, even objected to something in prose because to him "all
ink-stained women were equally detestable." to the natural resentment
against their intrusion into new fields was added that aroused by their
ideas and methods. as temperance reformers, they criticized in a caustic
manner those who would not accept their opinions. as opponents of
slavery they were especially bitter. one of their conventions, held at
philadelphia in 1833, passed a resolution calling on all women to leave
those churches that would not condemn every form of human bondage. this
stirred against them many of the clergy who, accustomed to having women
sit silent during services, were in no mood to treat such a revolt
leniently. then came the last straw. women decided that they would
preach--out of the pulpit first, and finally in it.

=women in industry.=--the period of this ferment was also the age of the
industrial revolution in america, the rise of the factory system, and
the growth of mill towns. the labor of women was transferred from the
homes to the factories. then arose many questions: the hours of labor,
the sanitary conditions of the mills, the pressure of foreign
immigration on native labor, the wages of women as compared with those
of men, and the right of married women to their own earnings. labor
organizations sprang up among working women. the mill girls of lowell,
massachusetts, mainly the daughters of new england farmers, published a
magazine, "the lowell offering." so excellent were their writings that
the french statesman, thiers, carried a copy of their paper into the
chamber of deputies to show what working women could achieve in a
republic. as women were now admittedly earning their own way in the
world by their own labor, they began to talk of their "economic
independence."

=the world shaken by revolution.=--such was the quickening of women's
minds in 1848 when the world was startled once more by a revolution in
france which spread to germany, poland, austria, hungary, and italy.
once more the people of the earth began to explore the principles of
democracy and expound human rights. women, now better educated and more
"advanced" in their ideas, played a role of still greater importance in
that revolution. they led in agitations and uprisings. they suffered
from reaction and persecution. from their prison in france, two of them
who had been jailed for too much insistence on women's rights exchanged
greetings with american women who were raising the same issue here. by
this time the women had more supporters among the men. horace greeley,
editor of the new york _tribune_, though he afterwards recanted, used
his powerful pen in their behalf. anti-slavery leaders welcomed their
aid and repaid them by urging the enfranchisement of women.

=the woman's rights convention of 1848.=--the forces, moral and
intellectual, which had been stirring among women, crystallized a few
months after the outbreak of the european revolution in the first
woman's rights convention in the history of america. it met at seneca
falls, new york, in 1848, on the call of lucretia mott, martha wright,
elizabeth cady stanton, and mary ann mcclintock, three of them quakers.
accustomed to take part in church meetings with men, the quakers
naturally suggested that men as well as women be invited to attend the
convention. indeed, a man presided over the conference, for that
position seemed too presumptuous even for such stout advocates of
woman's rights.

the deliberations of the seneca falls convention resulted in a
declaration of rights modeled after the declaration of independence. for
example, the preamble began: "when in the course of human events it
becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among
the people of the earth a position different from that which they have
hitherto occupied...." so also it closed: "such has been the patient
suffering of women under this government and such is now the necessity
which constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are
entitled." then followed the list of grievances, the same number which
had been exhibited to george iii in 1776. especially did they assail the
disabilities imposed upon them by the english common law imported into
america--the law which denied married women their property, their wages,
and their legal existence as separate persons. all these grievances they
recited to "a candid world." the remedies for the evils which they
endured were then set forth in detail. they demanded "equal rights" in
the colleges, trades, and professions; equal suffrage; the right to
share in all political offices, honors, and emoluments; the right to
complete equality in marriage, including equal guardianship of the
children; and for married women the right to own property, to keep
wages, to make contracts, to transact business, and to testify in the
courts of justice. in short, they declared women to be persons as men
are persons and entitled to all the rights and privileges of human
beings. such was the clarion call which went forth to the world in
1848--to an amused and contemptuous world, it must be admitted--but to a
world fated to heed and obey.

=the first gains in civil liberty.=--the convention of 1848 did not make
political enfranchisement the leading issue. rather did it emphasize the
civil disabilities of women which were most seriously under discussion
at the time. indeed, the new york legislature of that very year, as the
result of a twelve years' agitation, passed the married woman's property
act setting aside the general principles of the english common law as
applied to women and giving them many of the "rights of man." california
and wisconsin followed in 1850; massachusetts in 1854; and kansas in
1859. other states soon fell into line. women's earnings and
inheritances were at last their own in some states at least. in a little
while laws were passed granting women rights as equal guardians of their
children and permitting them to divorce their husbands on the grounds of
cruelty and drunkenness.

by degrees other steps were taken. the woman's medical college of
pennsylvania was founded in 1850, and the philadelphia school of design
for women three years later. in 1852 the american women's educational
association was formed to initiate an agitation for enlarged
educational opportunities for women. other colleges soon emulated the
example of oberlin: the university of utah in 1850; hillsdale college in
michigan in 1855; baker university in kansas in 1858; and the university
of iowa in 1860. new trades and professions were opened to women and old
prejudices against their activities and demands slowly gave way.


the national struggle for woman suffrage

=the beginnings of organization.=--as women surmounted one obstacle
after another, the agitation for equal suffrage came to the front. if
any year is to be fixed as the date of its beginning, it may very well
be 1850, when the suffragists of ohio urged the state constitutional
convention to confer the vote upon them. with apparent spontaneity there
were held in the same year state suffrage conferences in indiana,
pennsylvania, and massachusetts; and connections were formed among the
leaders of these meetings. at the same time the first national suffrage
convention was held in worcester, massachusetts, on the call of
eighty-nine leading men and women representing six states. accounts of
the convention were widely circulated in this country and abroad.
english women,--for instance, harriet martineau,--sent words of
appreciation for the work thus inaugurated. it inspired a leading
article in the "westminster review," which deeply interested the
distinguished economist, john stuart mill. soon he was the champion of
woman suffrage in the british parliament and the author of a powerful
tract _the subjection of women_, widely read throughout the
english-speaking world. thus do world movements grow. strange to relate
the women of england were enfranchised before the adoption of the
federal suffrage amendment in america.

the national suffrage convention of 1850 was followed by an
extraordinary outburst of agitation. pamphlets streamed from the press.
petitions to legislative bodies were drafted, signed, and presented.
there were addresses by favorite orators like garrison, phillips, and
curtis, and lectures and poems by men like emerson, longfellow, and
whittier. in 1853 the first suffrage paper was founded by the wife of a
member of congress from rhode island. by this time the last barrier to
white manhood suffrage in the north had been swept away and the woman's
movement was gaining momentum every year.

=the suffrage movement checked by the civil war.=--advocates of woman
suffrage believed themselves on the high road to success when the civil
war engaged the energies and labors of the nation. northern women became
absorbed in the struggle to preserve the union. they held no suffrage
conventions for five years. they transformed their associations into
loyalty leagues. they banded together to buy only domestic goods when
foreign imports threatened to ruin american markets. they rolled up
monster petitions in favor of the emancipation of slaves. in hospitals,
in military prisons, in agriculture, and in industry they bore their
full share of responsibility. even when the new york legislature took
advantage of their unguarded moments and repealed the law giving the
mother equal rights with the father in the guardianship of children,
they refused to lay aside war work for agitation. as in all other wars,
their devotion was unstinted and their sacrifices equal to the
necessities of the hour.

=the federal suffrage amendment.=--their plans and activities, when the
war closed, were shaped by events beyond their control. the emancipation
of the slaves and their proposed enfranchisement made prominent the
question of a national suffrage for the first time in our history.
friends of the colored man insisted that his civil liberties would not
be safe unless he was granted the right to vote. the woman suffragists
very pertinently asked why the same principle did not apply to women.
the answer which they received was negative. the fourteenth amendment to
the federal constitution, adopted in 1868, definitely put women aside by
limiting the scope of its application, so far as the suffrage was
concerned, to the male sex. in making manhood suffrage national,
however, it nationalized the issue.

this was the signal for the advocates of woman suffrage. in march, 1869,
their proposed amendment was introduced in congress by george w. julian
of indiana. it provided that no citizen should be deprived of the vote
on account of sex, following the language of the fifteenth amendment
which forbade disfranchisement on account of race. support for the
amendment, coming from many directions, led the suffragists to believe
that their case was hopeful. in their platform of 1872, for example, the
republicans praised the women for their loyal devotion to freedom,
welcomed them to spheres of wider usefulness, and declared that the
demand of any class of citizens for additional rights deserved
"respectful consideration."

experience soon demonstrated, however, that praise was not the ballot.
indeed the suffragists already had realized that a tedious contest lay
before them. they had revived in 1866 their regular national convention.
they gave the name of "the revolution" to their paper, edited by
elizabeth cady stanton and susan b. anthony. they formed a national
suffrage association and organized annual pilgrimages to congress to
present their claims. such activities bore some results. many eminent
congressmen were converted to their cause and presented it ably to their
colleagues of both chambers. still the subject was ridiculed by the
newspapers and looked upon as freakish by the masses.

=the state campaigns.=--discouraged by the outcome of the national
campaign, suffragists turned to the voters of the individual states and
sought the ballot at their hands. gains by this process were painfully
slow. wyoming, it is true, while still a territory, granted suffrage to
women in 1869 and continued it on becoming a state twenty years later,
in spite of strong protests in congress. in 1893 colorado established
complete political equality. in utah, the third suffrage state, the
cause suffered many vicissitudes. women were enfranchised by the
territorial legislature; they were deprived of the ballot by congress in
1887; finally in 1896 on the admission of utah to the union they
recovered their former rights. during the same year, 1896, idaho
conferred equal suffrage upon the women. this was the last suffrage
victory for more than a decade.

=the suffrage cause in congress.=--in the midst of the meager gains
among the states there were occasional flurries of hope for immediate
action on the federal amendment. between 1878 and 1896 the senate
committee reported the suffrage resolution by a favorable majority on
five different occasions. during the same period, however, there were
nine unfavorable reports and only once did the subject reach the point
of a general debate. at no time could anything like the required
two-thirds vote be obtained.

=the changing status of women.=--while the suffrage movement was
lagging, the activities of women in other directions were steadily
multiplying. college after college--vassar, bryn mawr, smith, wellesley,
to mention a few--was founded to give them the advantages of higher
education. other institutions, especially the state universities of the
west, opened their doors to women, and women were received into the
professions of law and medicine. by the rapid growth of public high
schools in which girls enjoyed the same rights as boys, education was
extended still more widely. the number of women teachers increased by
leaps and bounds.

meanwhile women were entering nearly every branch of industry and
business. how many of them worked at gainful occupations before 1870 we
do not know; but from that year forward we have the records of the
census. between 1870 and 1900 the proportion of women in the professions
rose from less than two per cent to more than ten per cent; in trade and
transportation from 24.8 per cent to 43.2 per cent; and in manufacturing
from 13 to 19 per cent. in 1910, there were over 8,000,000 women
gainfully employed as compared with 30,000,000 men. when, during the war
on germany, the government established the principle of equal pay for
equal work and gave official recognition to the value of their services
in industry, it was discovered how far women had traveled along the road
forecast by the leaders of 1848.

=the club movement among women.=--all over the country women's societies
and clubs were started to advance this or that reform or merely to study
literature, art, and science. in time these women's organizations of all
kinds were federated into city, state, and national associations and
drawn into the consideration of public questions. under the leadership
of frances willard they made temperance reform a vital issue. they took
an interest in legislation pertaining to prisons, pure food, public
health, and municipal government, among other things. at their sessions
and conferences local, state, and national issues were discussed until
finally, it seems, everything led to the quest of the franchise. by
solemn resolution in 1914 the national federation of women's clubs,
representing nearly two million club women, formally endorsed woman
suffrage. in the same year the national education association, speaking
for the public school teachers of the land, added its seal of approval.

=state and national action.=--again the suffrage movement was in full
swing in the states. washington in 1910, california in 1911, oregon,
kansas, and arizona in 1912, nevada and montana in 1914 by popular vote
enfranchised their women. illinois in 1913 conferred upon them the right
to vote for president of the united states. the time had arrived for a
new movement. a number of younger suffragists sought to use the votes of
women in the equal suffrage states to compel one or both of the national
political parties to endorse and carry through congress the federal
suffrage amendment. pressure then came upon congress from every
direction: from the suffragists who made a straight appeal on the
grounds of justice; and from the suffragists who besought the women of
the west to vote against candidates for president, who would not approve
the federal amendment. in 1916, for the first time, a leading
presidential candidate, mr. charles e. hughes, speaking for the
republicans, endorsed the federal amendment and a distinguished
ex-president, roosevelt, exerted a powerful influence to keep it an
issue in the campaign.

conference of men and women delegates at a national convention in
1920]

=national enfranchisement.=--after that, events moved rapidly. the great
state of new york adopted equal suffrage in 1917. oklahoma, south
dakota, and michigan swung into line the following year; several other
states, by legislative action, gave women the right to vote for
president. in the meantime the suffrage battle at washington grew
intense. appeals and petitions poured in upon congress and the
president. militant suffragists held daily demonstrations in washington.
on september 30, 1918, president wilson, who, two years before, had
opposed federal action and endorsed suffrage by state adoption only,
went before congress and urged the passage of the suffrage amendment to
the constitution. in june, 1919, the requisite two-thirds vote was
secured; the resolution was carried and transmitted to the states for
ratification. on august 28, 1920, the thirty-sixth state, tennessee,
approved the amendment, making three-fourths of the states as required
by the constitution. thus woman suffrage became the law of the land. a
new political democracy had been created. the age of agitation was
closed and the epoch of responsible citizenship opened.

chapter xxiv

industrial democracy


=the new economic age.=--the spirit of criticism and the measures of
reform designed to meet it, which characterized the opening years of the
twentieth century, were merely the signs of a new age. the nation had
definitely passed into industrialism. the number of city dwellers
employed for wages as contrasted with the farmers working on their own
land was steadily mounting. the free land, once the refuge of restless
workingmen of the east and the immigrants from europe, was a thing of
the past. as president roosevelt later said in speaking of the great
coal strike, "a few generations ago, the american workman could have
saved money, gone west, and taken up a homestead. now the free lands
were gone. in earlier days, a man who began with a pick and shovel might
come to own a mine. that outlet was now closed as regards the immense
majority.... the majority of men who earned wages in the coal industry,
if they wished to progress at all, were compelled to progress not by
ceasing to be wage-earners but by improving the conditions under which
all the wage-earners of the country lived and worked."

the disappearance of the free land, president roosevelt went on to say,
also produced "a crass inequality in the bargaining relation of the
employer and the individual employee standing alone. the great
coal-mining and coal-carrying companies which employed their tens of
thousands could easily dispense with the services of any particular
miner. the miner, on the other hand, however expert, could not dispense
with the companies. he needed a job; his wife and children would starve
if he did not get one.... individually the miners were impotent when
they sought to enter a wage contract with the great companies; they
could make fair terms only by uniting into trade unions to bargain
collectively." it was of this state of affairs that president taft spoke
when he favored the modification of the common law "so as to put
employees of little power and means on a level with their employers in
adjusting and agreeing upon their mutual obligations."

john d. rockefeller, jr., on the side of the great captains of industry,
recognized the same facts. he said: "in the early days of the
development of industry, the employer and capital investor were
frequently one. daily contact was had between him and his employees, who
were his friends and neighbors.... because of the proportions which
modern industry has attained, employers and employees are too often
strangers to each other.... personal relations can be revived only
through adequate representation of the employees. representation is a
principle which is fundamentally just and vital to the successful
conduct of industry.... it is not consistent for us as americans to
demand democracy in government and practice autocracy in industry....
with the developments what they are in industry to-day, there is sure to
come a progressive evolution from aristocratic single control, whether
by capital, labor, or the state, to democratic, cooperative control by
all three."


cooperation between employers and employees

=company unions.=--the changed economic life described by the three
eminent men just quoted was acknowledged by several great companies and
business concerns. all over the country decided efforts were made to
bridge the gulf which industry and the corporation had created. among
the devices adopted was that of the "company union." in one of the
western lumber mills, for example, all the employees were invited to
join a company organization; they held monthly meetings to discuss
matters of common concern; they elected a "shop committee" to confer
with the representatives of the company; and periodically the agents of
the employers attended the conferences of the men to talk over matters
of mutual interest. the function of the shop committee was to consider
wages, hours, safety rules, sanitation, recreation and other problems.
whenever any employee had a grievance he took it up with the foreman
and, if it was not settled to his satisfaction, he brought it before the
shop committee. if the members of the shop committee decided in favor of
the man with a grievance, they attempted to settle the matter with the
company's agents. all these things failing, the dispute was transferred
to a grand meeting of all the employees with the employers'
representatives, in common council. a deadlock, if it ensued from such a
conference, was broken by calling in impartial arbitrators selected by
both sides from among citizens outside the mill. thus the employees were
given a voice in all decisions affecting their work and welfare; rights
and grievances were treated as matters of mutual interest rather than
individual concern. representatives of trade unions from outside,
however, were rigidly excluded from all negotiations between employers
and the employees.

=profit-sharing.=--another proposal for drawing capital and labor
together was to supplement the wage system by other ties. sometimes lump
sums were paid to employees who remained in a company's service for a
definite period of years. again they were given a certain percentage of
the annual profits. in other instances, employees were allowed to buy
stock on easy terms and thus become part owners in the concern. this
last plan was carried so far by a large soap manufacturing company that
the employees, besides becoming stockholders, secured the right to elect
representatives to serve on the board of directors who managed the
entire business. so extensive had profit-sharing become by 1914 that the
federal industrial relations committee, appointed by the president,
deemed it worthy of a special study. though opposed by regular trade
unions, it was undoubtedly growing in popularity.

=labor managers and welfare work.=--another effort of employers to meet
the problems of the new age appeared in the appointment of specialists,
known as employment managers, whose task it was to study the relations
existing between masters and workers and discover practical methods for
dealing with each grievance as it arose. by 1918, hundreds of big
companies had recognized this modern "profession" and universities were
giving courses of instruction on the subject to young men and women. in
that year a national conference of employment managers was held at
rochester, new york. the discussion revealed a wide range of duties
assigned to managers, including questions of wages, hours, sanitation,
rest rooms, recreational facilities, and welfare work of every kind
designed to make the conditions in mills and factories safer and more
humane. thus it was evident that hundreds of employers had abandoned the
old idea that they were dealing merely with individual employees and
that their obligations ended with the payment of any wages they saw fit
to fix. in short, they were seeking to develop a spirit of cooperation
to take the place of competition and enmity; and to increase the
production of commodities by promoting the efficiency and happiness of
the producers.


the rise and growth of organized labor

=the american federation of labor.=--meanwhile a powerful association of
workers representing all the leading trades and crafts, organized into
unions of their own, had been built up outside the control of employers.
this was the american federation of labor, a nation-wide union of
unions, founded in 1886 on the basis of beginnings made five years
before. at the time of its establishment it had approximately 150,000
members. its growth up to the end of the century was slow, for the total
enrollment in 1900 was only 300,000. at that point the increase became
marked. the membership reached 1,650,000 in 1904 and more than 3,000,000
in 1919. to be counted in the ranks of organized labor were several
strong unions, friendly to the federation, though not affiliated with
it. such, for example, were the railway brotherhoods with more than half
a million members. by the opening of 1920 the total strength of
organized labor was put at about 4,000,000 members, meaning, if we
include their families, that nearly one-fifth of the people of the
united states were in some positive way dependent upon the operations of
trade unions.

=historical background.=--this was the culmination of a long and
significant history. before the end of the eighteenth century, the
skilled workmen--printers, shoemakers, tailors, and carpenters--had, as
we have seen, formed local unions in the large cities. between 1830 and
1860, several aggressive steps were taken in the american labor
movement. for one thing, the number of local unions increased by leaps
and bounds in all the industrial towns. for another, there was
established in every large manufacturing city a central labor body
composed of delegates from the unions of the separate trades. in the
local union the printers or the cordwainers, for example, considered
only their special trade problems. in the central labor union, printers,
cordwainers, iron molders, and other craftsmen considered common
problems and learned to cooperate with one another in enforcing the
demands of each craft. a third step was the federation of the unions of
the same craftsmen in different cities. the printers of new york,
philadelphia, boston, and other towns, for instance, drew together and
formed a national trade union of printers built upon the local unions of
that craft. by the eve of the civil war there were four or five powerful
national unions of this character. the expansion of the railway made
travel and correspondence easier and national conventions possible even
for workmen of small means. about 1834 an attempt was made to federate
the unions of all the different crafts into a national organization; but
the effort was premature.

_the national labor union._--the plan which failed in 1834 was tried
again in the sixties. during the war, industries and railways had
flourished as never before; prices had risen rapidly; the demand for
labor had increased; wages had mounted slowly, but steadily. hundreds of
new local unions had been founded and eight or ten national trade unions
had sprung into being. the time was ripe, it seemed, for a national
consolidation of all labor's forces; and in 1866, the year after the
surrender of general lee at appomattox, the "national labor union" was
formed at baltimore under the leadership of an experienced organizer,
w.h. sylvis of the iron molders. the purpose of the national labor union
was not merely to secure labor's standard demands touching hours, wages,
and conditions of work or to maintain the gains already won. it leaned
toward political action and radical opinions. above all, it sought to
eliminate the conflict between capital and labor by making workingmen
the owners of shops through the formation of cooperative industries. for
six years the national labor union continued to hold conferences and
carry on its propaganda; but most of the cooperative enterprises failed,
political dissensions arose, and by 1872 the experiment had come to an
end.

_the knights of labor._--while the national labor union was
experimenting, there grew up in the industrial world a more radical
organization known as the "noble order of the knights of labor." it was
founded in philadelphia in 1869, first as a secret society with rituals,
signs, and pass words; "so that no spy of the boss can find his way into
the lodge room to betray his fellows," as the knights put it. in form
the new organization was simple. it sought to bring all laborers,
skilled and unskilled, men and women, white and colored, into a mighty
body of local and national unions without distinction of trade or craft.
by 1885, ten years after the national organization was established, it
boasted a membership of over 700,000. in philosophy, the knights of
labor were socialistic, for they advocated public ownership of the
railways and other utilities and the formation of cooperative societies
to own and manage stores and factories.

as the knights were radical in spirit and their strikes, numerous and
prolonged, were often accompanied by violence, the organization alarmed
employers and the general public, raising up against itself a vigorous
opposition. weaknesses within, as well as foes from without, started the
knights on the path to dissolution. they waged more strikes than they
could carry on successfully; their cooperative experiments failed as
those of other labor groups before them had failed; and the rank and
file could not be kept in line. the majority of the members wanted
immediate gains in wages or the reduction of hours; when their hopes
were not realized they drifted away from the order. the troubles were
increased by the appearance of the american federation of labor, a still
mightier organization composed mainly of skilled workers who held
strategic positions in industry. when they failed to secure the
effective support of the federation in their efforts to organize the
unskilled, the employers closed in upon them; then the knights declined
rapidly in power. by 1890 they were a negligible factor and in a short
time they passed into the limbo of dead experiments.

=the policies of the american federation.=--unlike the knights of labor,
the american federation of labor sought, first of all, to be very
practical in its objects and methods. it avoided all kinds of
socialistic theories and attended strictly to the business of organizing
unions for the purpose of increasing wages, shortening hours, and
improving working conditions for its members. it did not try to include
everybody in one big union but brought together the employees of each
particular craft whose interests were clearly the same. to prepare for
strikes and periods of unemployment, it raised large funds by imposing
heavy dues and created a benefit system to hold men loyally to the
union. in order to permit action on a national scale, it gave the
superior officers extensive powers over local unions.

while declaring that employers and employees had much in common, the
federation strongly opposed company unions. employers, it argued, were
affiliated with the national manufacturers' association or with similar
employers' organizations; every important industry was now national in
scope; and wages and hours, in view of competition with other shops,
could not be determined in a single factory, no matter how amicable
might be the relations of the company and its workers in that particular
plant. for these reasons, the federation declared company unions and
local shop committees inherently weak; it insisted that hours, wages,
and other labor standards should be fixed by general trade agreements
applicable to all the plants of a given industry, even if subject to
local modifications.

at the same time, the federation, far from deliberately antagonizing
employers, sought to enlist their cooperation and support. it affiliated
with the national civic federation, an association of business men,
financiers, and professional men, founded in 1900 to promote friendly
relations in the industrial world. in brief, the american federation of
labor accepted the modern industrial system and, by organization within
it, endeavored to secure certain definite terms and conditions for trade
unionists.


the wider relations of organized labor

=the socialists.=--the trade unionism "pure and simple," espoused by the
american federation of labor, seemed to involve at first glance nothing
but businesslike negotiations with employers. in practice it did not
work out that way. the federation was only six years old when a new
organization, appealing directly for the labor vote--namely, the
socialist labor party--nominated a candidate for president, launched
into a national campaign, and called upon trade unionists to desert the
older parties and enter its fold.

the socialistic idea, introduced into national politics in 1892, had
been long in germination. before the civil war, a number of reformers,
including nathaniel hawthorne, horace greeley, and wendell phillips,
deeply moved by the poverty of the great industrial cities, had
earnestly sought relief in the establishment of cooperative or
communistic colonies. they believed that people should go into the
country, secure land and tools, own them in common so that no one could
profit from exclusive ownership, and produce by common labor the food
and clothing necessary for their support. for a time this movement
attracted wide interest, but it had little vitality. nearly all the
colonies failed. selfishness and indolence usually disrupted the best of
them.

in the course of time this "utopian" idea was abandoned, and another set
of socialist doctrines, claiming to be more "scientific," appeared
instead. the new school of socialists, adopting the principles of a
german writer and agitator, karl marx, appealed directly to workingmen.
it urged them to unite against the capitalists, to get possession of the
machinery of government, and to introduce collective or public ownership
of railways, land, mines, mills, and other means of production. the
marxian socialists, therefore, became political. they sought to organize
labor and to win elections. like the other parties they put forward
candidates and platforms. the socialist labor party in 1892, for
example, declared in favor of government ownership of utilities, free
school books, woman suffrage, heavy income taxes, and the referendum.
the socialist party, founded in 1900, with eugene v. debs, the leader of
the pullman strike, as its candidate, called for public ownership of all
trusts, monopolies, mines, railways; and the chief means of production.
in the course of time the vote of the latter organization rose to
considerable proportions, reaching almost a million in 1912. it declined
four years later and then rose in 1920 to about the same figure.

in their appeal for votes, the socialists of every type turned first to
labor. at the annual conventions of the american federation of labor
they besought the delegates to endorse socialism. the president of the
federation, samuel gompers, on each occasion took the floor against
them. he repudiated socialism and the socialists, on both theoretical
and practical grounds. he opposed too much public ownership, declaring
that the government was as likely as any private employer to oppress
labor. the approval of socialism, he maintained, would split the
federation on the rock of politics, weaken it in its fight for higher
wages and shorter hours, and prejudice the public against it. at every
turn he was able to vanquish the socialists in the federation, although
he could not prevent it from endorsing public ownership of the railways
at the convention of 1920.

=the extreme radicals.=--some of the socialists, defeated in their
efforts to capture organized labor and seeing that the gains in
elections were very meager, broke away from both trade unionism and
politics. one faction, the industrial workers of the world, founded in
1905, declared themselves opposed to all capitalists, the wages system,
and craft unions. they asserted that the "working class and the
employing class have nothing in common" and that trade unions only
pitted one set of workers against another set. they repudiated all
government ownership and the government itself, boldly proclaiming their
intention to unite all employees into one big union and seize the
railways, mines, and mills of the country. this doctrine, so
revolutionary in tone, called down upon the extremists the condemnation
of the american federation of labor as well as of the general public. at
its convention in 1919, the federation went on record as "opposed to
bolshevism, i.w.w.-ism, and the irresponsible leadership that encourages
such a policy." it announced its "firm adherence to american ideals."

=the federation and political issues.=--the hostility of the federation
to the socialists did not mean, however, that it was indifferent to
political issues or political parties. on the contrary, from time to
time, at its annual conventions, it endorsed political and social
reforms, such as the initiative, referendum, and recall, the abolition
of child labor, the exclusion of oriental labor, old-age pensions, and
government ownership. moreover it adopted the policy of "rewarding
friends and punishing enemies" by advising members to vote for or
against candidates according to their stand on the demands of organized
labor.

samuel gompers and other labor leaders]

this policy was pursued with especial zeal in connection with disputes
over the use of injunctions in labor controversies. an injunction is a
bill or writ issued by a judge ordering some person or corporation to do
or to refrain from doing something. for example, a judge may order a
trade union to refrain from interfering with non-union men or to
continue at work handling goods made by non-union labor; and he may fine
or imprison those who disobey his injunction, the penalty being
inflicted for "contempt of court." this ancient legal device came into
prominence in connection with nation-wide railway strikes in 1877. it
was applied with increasing frequency after its effective use against
eugene v. debs in the pullman strike of 1894.

aroused by the extensive use of the writ, organized labor demanded that
the power of judges to issue injunctions in labor disputes be limited by
law. representatives of the unions sought support from the democrats and
the republicans; they received from the former very specific and cordial
endorsement. in 1896 the democratic platform denounced "government by
injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of oppression." mr.
gompers, while refusing to commit the federation to democratic politics,
privately supported mr. bryan. in 1908, he came out openly and boasted
that eighty per cent of the votes of the federation had been cast for
the democratic candidate. again in 1912 the same policy was pursued. the
reward was the enactment in 1914 of a federal law exempting trade unions
from prosecution as combinations in restraint of trade, limiting the use
of the injunction in labor disputes, and prescribing trial by jury in
case of contempt of court. this measure was hailed by mr. gompers as the
"magna carta of labor" and a vindication of his policy. as a matter of
fact, however, it did not prevent the continued use of injunctions
against trade unions. nevertheless mr. gompers was unshaken in his
conviction that organized labor should not attempt to form an
independent political party or endorse socialist or other radical
economic theories.

=organized labor and the public.=--besides its relations to employers,
radicals within its own ranks, and political questions, the federation
had to face responsibilities to the general public. with the passing of
time these became heavy and grave. while industries were small and
conflicts were local in character, a strike seldom affected anybody but
the employer and the employees immediately involved in it. when,
however, industries and trade unions became organized on a national
scale and a strike could paralyze a basic enterprise like coal mining or
railways, the vital interests of all citizens were put in jeopardy.
moreover, as increases in wages and reductions in hours often added
directly to the cost of living, the action of the unions affected the
well-being of all--the food, clothing, and shelter of the whole people.

for the purpose of meeting the issue raised by this state of affairs, it
was suggested that employers and employees should lay their disputes
before commissions of arbitration for decision and settlement. president
cleveland, in a message of april 2, 1886, proposed such a method for
disposing of industrial controversies, and two years later congress
enacted a voluntary arbitration law applicable to the railways. the
principle was extended in 1898 and again in 1913, and under the
authority of the federal government many contentions in the railway
world were settled by arbitration.

the success of such legislation induced some students of industrial
questions to urge that unions and employers should be compelled to
submit all disputes to official tribunals of arbitration. kansas
actually passed such a law in 1920. congress in the esch-cummins railway
bill of the same year created a federal board of nine members to which
all railway controversies, not settled by negotiation, must be
submitted. strikes, however, were not absolutely forbidden. generally
speaking, both employers and employees opposed compulsory adjustments
without offering any substitute in case voluntary arbitration should not
be accepted by both parties to a dispute.


immigration and americanization

=the problems of immigration.=--from its very inception, the american
federation of labor, like the knights of labor before it, was confronted
by numerous questions raised by the ever swelling tide of aliens coming
to our shores. in its effort to make each trade union all-inclusive, it
had to wrestle with a score or more languages. when it succeeded in
thoroughly organizing a craft, it often found its purposes defeated by
an influx of foreigners ready to work for lower wages and thus undermine
the foundations of the union.

at the same time, persons outside the labor movement began to be
apprehensive as they contemplated the undoubted evil, as well as the
good, that seemed to be associated with the "alien invasion." they saw
whole sections of great cities occupied by people speaking foreign
tongues, reading only foreign newspapers, and looking to the old world
alone for their ideas and their customs. they witnessed an expanding
army of total illiterates, men and women who could read and write no
language at all; while among those aliens who could read few there were
who knew anything of american history, traditions, and ideals. official
reports revealed that over twenty per cent of the men of the draft army
during the world war could not read a newspaper or write a letter home.
perhaps most alarming of all was the discovery that thousands of alien
men are in the united states only on a temporary sojourn, solely to make
money and return home with their savings. these men, willing to work for
low wages and live in places unfit for human beings, have no stake in
this country and do not care what becomes of it.

=the restriction of immigration.=--in all this there was, strictly
speaking, no cause for surprise. since the foundation of our republic
the policy of the government had been to encourage the coming of the
alien. for nearly one hundred years no restraining act was passed by
congress, while two important laws positively encouraged it; namely, the
homestead act of 1862 and the contract immigration law of 1864. not
until american workingmen came into open collision with cheap chinese
labor on the pacific coast did the federal government spread the first
measure of limitation on the statute books. after the discovery of gold,
and particularly after the opening of the railway construction era, a
horde of laborers from china descended upon california. accustomed to
starvation wages and indifferent to the conditions of living, they
threatened to cut the american standard to the point of subsistence. by
1876 the protest of american labor was loud and long and both the
republicans and the democrats gave heed to it. in 1882 congress enacted
a law prohibiting the admission of chinese laborers to the united states
for a term of ten years--later extended by legislation. in a little
while the demand arose for the exclusion of the japanese as well. in
this case no exclusion law was passed; but an understanding was reached
by which japan agreed not to issue passports to her laborers authorizing
them to come to the united states. by act of congress in 1907 the
president was empowered to exclude any laborers who, having passports to
canada, hawaii, or mexico, attempted to enter our country.

these laws and agreements, however, did not remove all grounds for the
agitation of the subject. they were difficult to enforce and it was
claimed by residents of the coast that in spite of federal authority
oriental laborers were finding their way into american ports. moreover,
several western states, anxious to preserve the soil for american
ownership, enacted laws making it impossible for chinese and japanese to
buy land outright; and in other ways they discriminated against
orientals. such proceedings placed the federal government in an
embarrassing position. by treaty it had guaranteed specific rights to
japanese citizens in the united states, and the government at tokyo
contended that the state laws just cited violated the terms of the
international agreement. the western states were fixed in their
determination to control oriental residents; japan was equally
persistent in asking that no badge of inferiority be attached to her
citizens. subjected to pressure on both sides, the federal government
sought a way out of the deadlock.

having embarked upon the policy of restriction in 1882, congress readily
extended it. in that same year it barred paupers, criminals, convicts,
and the insane. three years later, mainly owing to the pressure of the
knights of labor, it forbade any person, company, or association to
import aliens under contract. by an act of 1887, the contract labor
restriction was made even more severe. in 1903, anarchists were excluded
and the bureau of immigration was transferred from the treasury
department to the department of commerce and labor, in order to provide
for a more rigid execution of the law. in 1907 the classes of persons
denied admission were widened to embrace those suffering from physical
and mental defects and otherwise unfit for effective citizenship. when
the department of labor was established in 1913 the enforcement of the
law was placed in the hands of the secretary of labor, w.b. wilson, who
was a former leader in the american federation of labor.

=the literacy test.=--still the advocates of restriction were not
satisfied. still organized labor protested and demanded more protection
against the competition of immigrants. in 1917 it won a thirty-year
battle in the passage of a bill excluding "all aliens over sixteen years
of age, physically capable of reading, who cannot read the english
language or some other language or dialect, including hebrew or
yiddish." even president wilson could not block it, for a two-thirds
vote to overcome his veto was mustered in congress.

this act, while it served to exclude illiterates, made no drastic cut in
the volume of immigration. indeed a material reduction was resolutely
opposed in many quarters. people of certain nationalities already in the
united states objected to every barrier that shut out their own kinsmen.
some americans of the old stock still held to the idea that the united
states should continue to be an asylum for "the oppressed of the earth."
many employers looked upon an increased labor supply as the means of
escaping what they called "the domination of trade unions." in the babel
of countless voices, the discussion of these vital matters went on in
town and country.

=americanization.=--intimately connected with the subject of immigration
was a call for the "americanization" of the alien already within our
gates. the revelation of the illiteracy in the army raised the cry and
the demand was intensified when it was found that many of the leaders
among the extreme radicals were foreign in birth and citizenship.
innumerable programs for assimilating the alien to american life were
drawn up, and in 1919 a national conference on the subject was held in
washington under the auspices of the department of the interior. all
were agreed that the foreigner should be taught to speak and write the
language and understand the government of our country. congress was
urged to lend aid in this vast undertaking. america, as ex-president
roosevelt had said, was to find out "whether it was a nation or a
boarding-house."

chapter xxv

president wilson and the world war


"the welfare, the happiness, the energy, and the spirit of the men and
women who do the daily work in our mines and factories, on our
railroads, in our offices and ports of trade, on our farms, and on the
sea are the underlying necessity of all prosperity." thus spoke woodrow
wilson during his campaign for election. in this spirit, as president,
he gave the signal for work by summoning congress in a special session
on april 7, 1913. he invited the cooperation of all "forward-looking
men" and indicated that he would assume the role of leadership. as an
evidence of his resolve, he appeared before congress in person to read
his first message, reviving the old custom of washington and adams. then
he let it be known that he would not give his party any rest until it
fulfilled its pledges to the country. when democratic senators balked at
tariff reductions, they were sharply informed that the party had
plighted its word and that no excuses or delays would be tolerated.


domestic legislation

=financial measures.=--under this spirited leadership congress went to
work, passing first the underwood tariff act of 1913, which made a
downward revision in the rates of duty, fixing them on the average about
twenty-six per cent lower than the figures of 1907. the protective
principle was retained, but an effort was made to permit a moderate
element of foreign competition. as a part of the revenue act congress
levied a tax on incomes as authorized by the sixteenth amendment to the
constitution. the tax which roused such party passions twenty years
before was now accepted as a matter of course.

having disposed of the tariff, congress took up the old and vexatious
currency question and offered a new solution in the form of the federal
reserve law of december, 1913. this measure, one of the most interesting
in the history of federal finance, embraced four leading features. in
the first place, it continued the prohibition on the issuance of notes
by state banks and provided for a national currency. in the second
place, it put the new banking system under the control of a federal
reserve board composed entirely of government officials. to prevent the
growth of a "central money power," it provided, in the third place, for
the creation of twelve federal reserve banks, one in each of twelve
great districts into which the country is divided. all local national
banks were required and certain other banks permitted to become members
of the new system and share in its control. finally, with a view to
expanding the currency, a step which the democrats had long urged upon
the country, the issuance of paper money, under definite safeguards, was
authorized.

mindful of the agricultural interest, ever dear to the heart of
jefferson's followers, the democrats supplemented the reserve law by the
farm loan act of 1916, creating federal agencies to lend money on farm
mortgages at moderate rates of interest. within a year $20,000,000 had
been lent to farmers, the heaviest borrowing being in nine western and
southern states, with texas in the lead.

=anti-trust legislation.=--the tariff and currency laws were followed by
three significant measures relative to trusts. rejecting utterly the
progressive doctrine of government regulation, president wilson
announced that it was the purpose of the democrats "to destroy monopoly
and maintain competition as the only effective instrument of business
liberty." the first step in this direction, the clayton anti-trust act,
carried into great detail the sherman law of 1890 forbidding and
penalizing combinations in restraint of interstate and foreign trade. in
every line it revealed a determined effort to tear apart the great
trusts and to put all business on a competitive basis. its terms were
reinforced in the same year by a law creating a federal trade commission
empowered to inquire into the methods of corporations and lodge
complaints against concerns "using any unfair method of competition." in
only one respect was the severity of the democratic policy relaxed. an
act of 1918 provided that the sherman law should not apply to companies
engaged in export trade, the purpose being to encourage large
corporations to enter foreign commerce.

the effect of this whole body of anti-trust legislation, in spite of
much labor on it, remained problematical. very few combinations were
dissolved as a result of it. startling investigations were made into
alleged abuses on the part of trusts; but it could hardly be said that
huge business concerns had lost any of their predominance in american
industry.

=labor legislation.=--by no mere coincidence, the clayton anti-trust law
of 1914 made many concessions to organized labor. it declared that "the
labor of a human being is not a commodity or an article of commerce,"
and it exempted unions from prosecution as "combinations in restraint of
trade." it likewise defined and limited the uses which the federal
courts might make of injunctions in labor disputes and guaranteed trial
by jury to those guilty of disobedience (see p. 581).

the clayton law was followed the next year by the seamen's act giving
greater liberty of contract to american sailors and requiring an
improvement of living conditions on shipboard. this was such a drastic
law that shipowners declared themselves unable to meet foreign
competition under its terms, owing to the low labor standards of other
countries.

still more extraordinary than the seamen's act was the adamson law of
1916 fixing a standard eight-hour work-day for trainmen on railroads--a
measure wrung from congress under a threat of a great strike by the four
railway brotherhoods. this act, viewed by union leaders as a triumph,
called forth a bitter denunciation of "trade union domination," but it
was easier to criticize than to find another solution of the problem.

three other laws enacted during president wilson's administration were
popular in the labor world. one of them provided compensation for
federal employees injured in the discharge of their duties. another
prohibited the labor of children under a certain age in the industries
of the nation. a third prescribed for coal miners in alaska an
eight-hour day and modern safeguards for life and health. there were
positive proofs that organized labor had obtained a large share of power
in the councils of the country.

=federal and state relations.=--if the interference of the government
with business and labor represented a departure from the old idea of
"the less government the better," what can be said of a large body of
laws affecting the rights of states? the prohibition of child labor
everywhere was one indication of the new tendency. mr. wilson had once
declared such legislation unconstitutional; the supreme court declared
it unconstitutional; but congress, undaunted, carried it into effect
under the guise of a tax on goods made by children below the age limit.
there were other indications of the drift. large sums of money were
appropriated by congress in 1916 to assist the states in building and
maintaining highways. the same year the farm loan act projected the
federal government into the sphere of local money lending. in 1917
millions of dollars were granted to states in aid of vocational
education, incidentally imposing uniform standards throughout the
country. evidently the government was no longer limited to the duties of
the policeman.

=the prohibition amendment.=--a still more significant form of
intervention in state affairs was the passage, in december, 1917, of an
amendment to the federal constitution establishing national prohibition
of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as beverages. this
was the climax of a historical movement extending over half a century.
in 1872, a national prohibition party, launched three years before,
nominated its first presidential candidate and inaugurated a campaign of
agitation. though its vote was never large, the cause for which it
stood found increasing favor among the people. state after state by
popular referendum abolished the liquor traffic within its borders. by
1917 at least thirty-two of the forty-eight were "dry." when the federal
amendment was submitted for approval, the ratification was surprisingly
swift. in a little more than a year, namely, on january 16, 1919, it was
proclaimed. twelve months later the amendment went into effect.


colonial and foreign policies

=the philippines and porto rico.=--independence for the philippines and
larger self-government for porto rico had been among the policies of the
democratic party since the campaign of 1900. president wilson in his
annual messages urged upon congress more autonomy for the filipinos and
a definite promise of final independence. the result was the jones
organic act for the philippines passed in 1916. this measure provided
that the upper as well as the lower house of the philippine legislature
should be elected by popular vote, and declared it to be the intention
of the united states to grant independence "as soon as a stable
government can be established." this, said president wilson on signing
the bill, is "a very satisfactory advance in our policy of extending to
them self-government and control of their own affairs." the following
year congress, yielding to president wilson's insistence, passed a new

organic act for porto rico, making both houses of the legislature
elective and conferring american citizenship upon the inhabitants of the
island.

[illustration: the caribbean region]

=american power in the caribbean.=--while extending more self-government
to its dominions, the united states enlarged its sphere of influence in
the caribbean. the supervision of finances in santo domingo, inaugurated
in roosevelt's administration, was transformed into a protectorate under
wilson. in 1914 dissensions in the republic led to the landing of
american marines to "supervise" the elections. two years later, an
officer in the american navy, with authority from washington, placed
the entire republic "in a state of military occupation." he proceeded to
suspend the government and laws of the country, exile the president,
suppress the congress, and substitute american military authority. in
1919 a consulting board of four prominent dominicans was appointed to
aid the american military governor; but it resigned the next year after
making a plea for the restoration of independence to the republic. for
all practical purposes, it seemed, the sovereignty of santo domingo had
been transferred to the united states.

in the neighboring republic of haiti, a similar state of affairs
existed. in the summer of 1915 a revolution broke out there--one of a
long series beginning in 1804--and our marines were landed to restore
order. elections were held under the supervision of american officers,
and a treaty was drawn up placing the management of haitian finances and
the local constabulary under american authority. in taking this action,
our secretary of state was careful to announce: "the united states
government has no purpose of aggression and is entirely disinterested in
promoting this protectorate." still it must be said that there were
vigorous protests on the part of natives and american citizens against
the conduct of our agents in the island. in 1921 president wilson was
considering withdrawal.

in line with american policy in the west indian waters was the purchase
in 1917 of the danish islands just off the coast of porto rico. the
strategic position of the islands, especially in relation to haiti and
porto rico, made them an object of american concern as early as 1867,
when a treaty of purchase was negotiated only to be rejected by the
senate of the united states. in 1902 a second arrangement was made, but
this time it was defeated by the upper house of the danish parliament.
the third treaty brought an end to fifty years of bargaining and the
stars and stripes were raised over st. croix, st. thomas, st. john, and
numerous minor islands scattered about in the neighborhood. "it would be
suicidal," commented a new york newspaper, "for america, on the
threshold of a great commercial expansion in south america, to suffer a
heligoland, or a gibraltar, or an aden to be erected by her rivals at
the mouth of her suez." on the mainland american power was strengthened
by the establishment of a protectorate over nicaragua in 1916.

=mexican relations.=--the extension of american enterprise southward
into latin america, of which the operations in the caribbean regions
were merely one phase, naturally carried americans into mexico to
develop the natural resources of that country. under the iron rule of
general porfirio diaz, established in 1876 and maintained with only a
short break until 1911, mexico had become increasingly attractive to our
business men. on the invitation of president diaz, they had invested
huge sums in mexican lands, oil fields, and mines, and had laid the
foundations of a new industrial order. the severe regime instituted by
diaz, however, stirred popular discontent. the peons, or serfs, demanded
the break-up of the great estates, some of which had come down from the
days of cortez. their clamor for "the restoration of the land to the
people could not be silenced." in 1911 diaz was forced to resign and
left the country.

mexico now slid down the path to disorder. revolutions and civil
commotions followed in swift succession. a liberal president, madero,
installed as the successor to diaz, was deposed in 1913 and brutally
murdered. huerta, a military adventurer, hailed for a time as another
"strong man," succeeded madero whose murder he was accused of
instigating. although great britain and nearly all the powers of europe
accepted the new government as lawful, the united states steadily
withheld recognition. in the meantime mexico was torn by insurrections
under the leadership of carranza, a friend of madero, villa, a bandit of
generous pretensions, and zapata, a radical leader of the peons. without
the support of the united states, huerta was doomed.

in the summer of 1914, the dictator resigned and fled from the capital,
leaving the field to carranza. for six years the new president,
recognized by the united states, held a precarious position which he
vigorously strove to strengthen against various revolutionary movements.
at length in 1920, he too was deposed and murdered, and another military
chieftain, obregon, installed in power.

these events right at our door could not fail to involve the government
of the united states. in the disorders many american citizens lost their
lives. american property was destroyed and land owned by americans was
confiscated. a new mexican constitution, in effect nationalizing the
natural resources of the country, struck at the rights of foreign
investors. moreover the mexican border was in constant turmoil. even in
the last days of his administration, mr. taft felt compelled to issue a
solemn warning to the mexican government protesting against the
violation of american rights.

president wilson, soon after his inauguration, sent a commissioner to
mexico to inquire into the situation. although he declared a general
policy of "watchful waiting," he twice came to blows with mexican
forces. in 1914 some american sailors at tampico were arrested by a
mexican officer; the mexican government, although it immediately
released the men, refused to make the required apology for the incident.
as a result president wilson ordered the landing of american forces at
vera cruz and the occupation of the city. a clash of arms followed in
which several americans were killed. war seemed inevitable, but at this
juncture the governments of argentina, brazil, and chile tendered their
good offices as mediators. after a few weeks of negotiation, during
which huerta was forced out of power, american forces were withdrawn
from vera cruz and the incident closed.

in 1916 a second break in amicable relations occurred. in the spring of
that year a band of villa's men raided the town of columbus, new mexico,
killing several citizens and committing robberies. a punitive expedition
under the command of general pershing was quickly sent out to capture
the offenders. against the protests of president carranza, american
forces penetrated deeply into mexico without effecting the object of
the undertaking. this operation lasted until january, 1917, when the
imminence of war with germany led to the withdrawal of the american
soldiers. friendly relations were resumed with the mexican government
and the policy of "watchful waiting" was continued.


the united states and the european war

=the outbreak of the war.=--in the opening days of august, 1914, the
age-long jealousies of european nations, sharpened by new imperial
ambitions, broke out in another general conflict such as had shaken the
world in the days of napoleon. on june 28, the heir to the
austro-hungarian throne was assassinated at serajevo, the capital of
bosnia, an austrian province occupied mainly by serbs. with a view to
stopping serbian agitation for independence, austria-hungary laid the
blame for this incident on the government of serbia and made humiliating
demands on that country. germany at once proposed that the issue should
be regarded as "an affair which should be settled solely between
austria-hungary and serbia"; meaning that the small nation should be
left to the tender mercies of a great power. russia refused to take this
view. great britain proposed a settlement by mediation. germany backed
up austria to the limit. to use the language of the german authorities:
"we were perfectly aware that a possible warlike attitude of
austria-hungary against serbia might bring russia upon the field and
that it might therefore involve us in a war, in accordance with our
duties as allies. we could not, however, in these vital interests of
austria-hungary which were at stake, advise our ally to take a yielding
attitude not compatible with his dignity nor deny him our assistance."
that made the war inevitable.

every day of the fateful august, 1914, was crowded with momentous
events. on the 1st, germany declared war on russia. on the 2d, the
germans invaded the little duchy of luxemburg and notified the king of
belgium that they were preparing to violate the neutrality of his realm
on their way to paris. on the same day, great britain, anxiously
besought by the french government, promised the aid of the british navy
if german warships made hostile demonstrations in the channel. august
3d, the german government declared war on france. the following day,
great britain demanded of germany respect for belgian neutrality and,
failing to receive the guarantee, broke off diplomatic relations. on the
5th, the british prime minister announced that war had opened between
england and germany. the storm now broke in all its pitiless fury.

=the state of american opinion.=--although president wilson promptly
proclaimed the neutrality of the united states, the sympathies of a
large majority of the american people were without doubt on the side of
great britain and france. to them the invasion of the little kingdom of
belgium and the horrors that accompanied german occupation were odious
in the extreme. moreover, they regarded the german imperial government
as an autocratic power wielded in the interest of an ambitious military
party. the kaiser, william ii, and the crown prince were the symbols of
royal arrogance. on the other hand, many americans of german descent, in
memory of their ties with the fatherland, openly sympathized with the
central powers; and many americans of irish descent, recalling their
long and bitter struggle for home rule in ireland, would have regarded
british defeat as a merited redress of ancient grievances.

extremely sensitive to american opinion, but ill informed about it, the
german government soon began systematic efforts to present its cause to
the people of the united states in the most favorable light possible.
dr. bernhard dernburg, the former colonial secretary of the german
empire, was sent to america as a special agent. for months he filled the
newspapers, magazines, and periodicals with interviews, articles, and
notes on the justice of the teutonic cause. from a press bureau in new
york flowed a stream of pamphlets, leaflets, and cartoons. a magazine,
"the fatherland," was founded to secure "fair play for germany and
austria." several professors in american universities, who had received
their training in germany, took up the pen in defense of the central
empires. the german language press, without exception it seems, the
national german alliance, minor german societies, and lutheran churches
came to the support of the german cause. even the english language
papers, though generally favorable to the entente allies, opened their
columns in the interest of equal justice to the spokesmen for all the
contending powers of europe.

before two weeks had elapsed the controversy had become so intense that
president wilson (august 18, 1914) was moved to caution his countrymen
against falling into angry disputes. "every man," he said, "who really
loves america will act and speak in the true spirit of neutrality which
is the spirit of impartiality and fairness and friendliness to all
concerned.... we must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must
put a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that
might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before
another."

=the clash over american trade.=--as in the time of the napoleonic wars,
the conflict in europe raised fundamental questions respecting rights of
americans trading with countries at peace as well as those at war. on
this point there existed on august 1, 1914, a fairly definite body of
principles by which nations were bound. among them the following were of
vital significance. in the first place, it was recognized that an enemy
merchant ship caught on the high seas was a legitimate prize of war
which might be seized and confiscated. in the second place, it was
agreed that "contraband of war" found on an enemy or neutral ship was a
lawful prize; any ship suspected of carrying it was liable to search and
if caught with forbidden goods was subject to seizure. in the third
place, international law prescribed that a peaceful merchant ship,
whether belonging to an enemy or to a neutral country, should not be
destroyed or sunk without provision for the safety of crew and
passengers. in the fourth place, it was understood that a belligerent
had the right, if it could, to blockade the ports of an enemy and
prevent the ingress and egress of all ships; but such a blockade, to be
lawful, had to be effective.

these general principles left undetermined two important matters: "what
is an effective blockade?" and "what is contraband of war?" the task of
answering these questions fell to great britain as mistress of the seas.
although the german submarines made it impossible for her battleships to
maintain a continuous patrol of the waters in front of blockaded ports,

she declared the blockade to be none the less "effective" because her
navy was supreme. as to contraband of war great britain put such a broad
interpretation upon the term as to include nearly every important
article of commerce. early in 1915 she declared even cargoes of grain
and flour to be contraband, defending the action on the ground that the
german government had recently taken possession of all domestic stocks
of corn, wheat, and flour.

a new question arose in connection with american trade with the neutral
countries surrounding germany. great britain early began to intercept
ships carrying oil, gasoline, and copper--all war materials of prime
importance--on the ground that they either were destined ultimately to
germany or would release goods for sale to germans. on november 2, 1914,
the english government announced that the germans wore sowing mines in
open waters and that therefore the whole of the north sea was a military
zone. ships bound for denmark, norway, and sweden were ordered to come
by the english channel for inspection and sailing directions. in effect,
americans were now licensed by great britain to trade in certain
commodities and in certain amounts with neutral countries.

against these extraordinary measures, the state department at washington
lodged pointed objections, saying: "this government is reluctantly
forced to the conclusion that the present policy of his majesty's
government toward neutral ships and cargoes exceeds the manifest
necessity of a belligerent and constitutes restrictions upon the rights
of american citizens on the high seas, which are not justified by the
rules of international law or required under the principle of
self-preservation."

=germany begins the submarine campaign.=--germany now announced that, on
and after february 18, 1915, the whole of the english channel and the
waters around great britain would be deemed a war zone and that every
enemy ship found therein would be destroyed. the german decree added
that, as the british admiralty had ordered the use of neutral flags by
english ships in time of distress, neutral vessels would be in danger of
destruction if found in the forbidden area. it was clear that germany
intended to employ submarines to destroy shipping. a new factor was thus
introduced into naval warfare, one not provided for in the accepted laws
of war. a warship overhauling a merchant vessel could easily take its
crew and passengers on board for safe keeping as prescribed by
international law; but a submarine ordinarily could do nothing of the
sort. of necessity the lives and the ships of neutrals, as well as of
belligerents, were put in mortal peril. this amazing conduct germany
justified on the ground that it was mere retaliation against great
britain for her violations of international law.

the response of the united states to the ominous german order was swift
and direct. on february 10, 1915, it warned germany that if her
commanders destroyed american lives and ships in obedience to that
decree, the action would "be very hard indeed to reconcile with the
friendly relations happily subsisting between the two governments." the
american note added that the german imperial government would be held to
"strict accountability" and all necessary steps would be taken to
safeguard american lives and american rights. this was firm and clear
language, but the only response which it evoked from germany was a
suggestion that, if great britain would allow food supplies to pass
through the blockade, the submarine campaign would be dropped.

=violations of american rights.=--meanwhile germany continued to ravage
shipping on the high seas. on january 28, a german raider sank the
american ship, _william p. frye_, in the south atlantic; on march 28, a
british ship, the _falaba_, was sunk by a submarine and many on board,
including an american citizen, were killed; and on april 28, a german
airplane dropped bombs on the american steamer _cushing_. on the morning
of may 1, 1915, americans were astounded to see in the newspapers an
advertisement, signed by the german imperial embassy, warning travelers
of the dangers in the war zone and notifying them that any who ventured
on british ships into that area did so at their own risk. on that day,
the _lusitania_, a british steamer, sailed from new york for liverpool.
on may 7, without warning, the ship was struck by two torpedoes and in a
few minutes went down by the bow, carrying to death 1153 persons
including 114 american men, women, and children. a cry of horror ran
through the country. the german papers in america and a few american
people argued that american citizens had been duly warned of the danger
and had deliberately taken their lives into their own hands; but the
terrible deed was almost universally condemned by public opinion.

=the _lusitania_ notes.=--on may 14, the department of state at
washington made public the first of three famous notes on the
_lusitania_ case. it solemnly informed the german government that "no
warning that an unlawful and inhumane act will be committed can possibly
be accepted as an excuse or palliation for that act or as an abatement
of the responsibility for its commission." it called upon the german
government to disavow the act, make reparation as far as possible, and
take steps to prevent "the recurrence of anything so obviously
subversive of the principles of warfare." the note closed with a clear
caution to germany that the government of the united states would not
"omit any word or any act necessary to the performance of its sacred
duty of maintaining the rights of the united states and its citizens and
of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment." the die was cast;
but germany in reply merely temporized.

in a second note, made public on june 11, the position of the united
states was again affirmed. william jennings bryan, the secretary of
state, had resigned because the drift of president wilson's policy was
not toward mediation but the strict maintenance of american rights, if
need be, by force of arms. the german reply was still evasive and german
naval commanders continued their course of sinking merchant ships. in a
third and final note of july 21, 1915, president wilson made it clear to
germany that he meant what he said when he wrote that he would maintain
the rights of american citizens. finally after much discussion and
shifting about, the german ambassador on september 1, 1915, sent a brief
note to the secretary of state: "liners will not be sunk by our
submarines without warning and without safety of the lives of
non-combatants, provided the liners do not try to escape or offer
resistance." editorially, the new york _times_ declared: "it is a
triumph not only of diplomacy but of reason, of humanity, of justice,
and of truth." the secretary of state saw in it "a recognition of the
fundamental principles for which we have contended."

=the presidential election of 1916.=--in the midst of this crisis came
the presidential campaign. on the republican side everything seemed to
depend upon the action of the progressives. if the breach created in
1912 could be closed, victory was possible; if not, defeat was certain.
a promise of unity lay in the fact that the conventions of the
republicans and progressives were held simultaneously in chicago. the
friends of roosevelt hoped that both parties would select him as their
candidate; but this hope was not realized. the republicans chose, and
the progressives accepted, charles e. hughes, an associate justice of
the federal supreme court who, as governor of new york, had won a
national reputation by waging war on "machine politicians."

in the face of the clamor for expressions of sympathy with one or the
other of the contending powers of europe, the republicans chose a middle
course, declaring that they would uphold all american rights "at home
and abroad, by land and by sea." this sentiment mr. hughes echoed in his
acceptance speech. by some it was interpreted to mean a firmer policy in
dealing with great britain; by others, a more vigorous handling of the
submarine menace. the democrats, on their side, renominated president
wilson by acclamation, reviewed with pride the legislative achievements
of the party, and commended "the splendid diplomatic victories of our
great president who has preserved the vital interests of our government
and its citizens and kept us out of war."

in the election which ensued president wilson's popular vote exceeded
that cast for mr. hughes by more than half a million, while his
electoral vote stood 277 to 254. the result was regarded, and not
without warrant, as a great personal triumph for the president. he had
received the largest vote yet cast for a presidential candidate. the
progressive party practically disappeared, and the socialists suffered a
severe set-back, falling far behind the vote of 1912.

=president wilson urges peace upon the warring nations.=--apparently
convinced that his pacific policies had been profoundly approved by his
countrymen, president wilson, soon after the election, addressed "peace
notes" to the european belligerents. on december 16, the german emperor
proposed to the allied powers that they enter into peace negotiations, a
suggestion that was treated as a mere political maneuver by the opposing
governments. two days later president wilson sent a note to the warring
nations asking them to avow "the terms upon which war might be
concluded." to these notes the central powers replied that they were
ready to meet their antagonists in a peace conference; and allied powers
answered by presenting certain conditions precedent to a satisfactory
settlement. on january 22, 1917, president wilson in an address before
the senate, declared it to be a duty of the united states to take part
in the establishment of a stable peace on the basis of certain
principles. these were, in short: "peace without victory"; the right of
nationalities to freedom and self-government; the independence of
poland; freedom of the seas; the reduction of armaments; and the
abolition of entangling alliances. the whole world was discussing the
president's remarkable message, when it was dumbfounded to hear, on
january 31, that the german ambassador at washington had announced the
official renewal of ruthless submarine warfare.


the united states at war

=steps toward war.=--three days after the receipt of the news that the
german government intended to return to its former submarine policy,
president wilson severed diplomatic relations with the german empire. at
the same time he explained to congress that he desired no conflict with
germany and would await an "overt act" before taking further steps to
preserve american rights. "god grant," he concluded, "that we may not be
challenged to defend them by acts of willful injustice on the part of
the government of germany." yet the challenge came. between february 26
and april 2, six american merchant vessels were torpedoed, in most cases
without any warning and without regard to the loss of american lives.
president wilson therefore called upon congress to answer the german
menace. the reply of congress on april 6 was a resolution, passed with
only a few dissenting votes, declaring the existence of a state of war
with germany. austria-hungary at once severed diplomatic relations with
the united states; but it was not until december 7 that congress, acting
on the president's advice, declared war also on that "vassal of the
german government."

=american war aims.=--in many addresses at the beginning and during the
course of the war, president wilson stated the purposes which actuated
our government in taking up arms. he first made it clear that it was a
war of self-defense. "the military masters of germany," he exclaimed,
"denied us the right to be neutral." proof of that lay on every hand.
agents of the german imperial government had destroyed american lives
and american property on the high seas. they had filled our communities
with spies. they had planted bombs in ships and munition works. they had
fomented divisions among american citizens.

though assailed in many ways and compelled to resort to war, the united
states sought no material rewards. "the world must be made safe for
democracy. its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of
political liberty. we have no selfish ends to serve. we desire no
conquest, no dominion. we seek no indemnities for ourselves."

in a very remarkable message read to congress on january 8, 1918,
president wilson laid down his famous "fourteen points" summarizing the
ideals for which we were fighting. they included open treaties of peace,
openly arrived at; absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas; the
removal, as far as possible, of trade barriers among nations; reduction
of armaments; adjustment of colonial claims in the interest of the
populations concerned; fair and friendly treatment of russia; the
restoration of belgium; righting the wrong done to france in 1871 in the
matter of alsace-lorraine; adjustment of italian frontiers along the
lines of nationality; more liberty for the peoples of austria-hungary;
the restoration of serbia and rumania; the readjustment of the turkish
empire; an independent poland; and an association of nations to afford
mutual guarantees to all states great and small. on a later occasion
president wilson elaborated the last point, namely, the formation of a
league of nations to guarantee peace and establish justice among the
powers of the world. democracy, the right of nations to determine their
own fate, a covenant of enduring peace--these were the ideals for which
the american people were to pour out their blood and treasure.

=the selective draft.=--the world war became a war of nations. the
powers against which we were arrayed had every able-bodied man in
service and all their resources, human and material, thrown into the
scale. for this reason, president wilson summoned the whole people of
the united states to make every sacrifice necessary for victory.
congress by law decreed that the national army should be chosen from all
male citizens and males not enemy aliens who had declared their
intention of becoming citizens. by the first act of may 18, 1917, it
fixed the age limits at twenty-one to thirty-one inclusive. later, in
august, 1918, it extended them to eighteen and forty-five. from the men
of the first group so enrolled were chosen by lot the soldiers for the
world war who, with the regular army and the national guard, formed the
american expeditionary force upholding the american cause on the
battlefields of europe. "the whole nation," said the president, "must be
a team in which each man shall play the part for which he is best
fitted."

=liberty loans and taxes.=--in order that the military and naval forces
should be stinted in no respect, the nation was called upon to place its
financial resources at the service of the government. some urged the
"conscription of wealth as well as men," meaning the support of the war
out of taxes upon great fortunes; but more conservative counsels
prevailed. four great liberty loans were floated, all the agencies of
modern publicity being employed to enlist popular interest. the first
loan had four and a half million subscribers; the fourth more than
twenty million. combined with loans were heavy taxes. a progressive tax
was laid upon incomes beginning with four per cent on incomes in the
lower ranges and rising to sixty-three per cent of that part of any
income above $2,000,000. a progressive tax was levied upon inheritances.
an excess profits tax was laid upon all corporations and partnerships,
rising in amount to sixty per cent of the net income in excess of
thirty-three per cent on the invested capital. "this," said a
distinguished economist, "is the high-water mark in the history of
taxation. never before in the annals of civilization has an attempt been
made to take as much as two-thirds of a man's income by taxation."

=mobilizing material resources.=--no stone was left unturned to provide
the arms, munitions, supplies, and transportation required in the
gigantic undertaking. between the declaration of war and the armistice,
congress enacted law after law relative to food supplies, raw materials,
railways, mines, ships, forests, and industrial enterprises. no power
over the lives and property of citizens, deemed necessary to the
prosecution of the armed conflict, was withheld from the government. the
farmer's wheat, the housewife's sugar, coal at the mines, labor in the
factories, ships at the wharves, trade with friendly countries, the
railways, banks, stores, private fortunes--all were mobilized and laid
under whatever obligations the government deemed imperative. never was a
nation more completely devoted to a single cause.

a law of august 10, 1917, gave the president power to fix the prices of
wheat and coal and to take almost any steps necessary to prevent
monopoly and excessive prices. by a series of measures, enlarging the
principles of the shipping act of 1916, ships and shipyards were brought
under public control and the government was empowered to embark upon a
great ship-building program. in december, 1917, the government assumed
for the period of the war the operation of the railways under a
presidential proclamation which was elaborated in march, 1918, by act of
congress. in the summer of 1918 the express, telephone, and telegraph
business of the entire country passed under government control. by war
risk insurance acts allowances were made for the families of enlisted
men, compensation for injuries was provided, death benefits were
instituted, and a system of national insurance was established in the
interest of the men in service. never before in the history of the
country had the government taken such a wise and humane view of its
obligations to those who served on the field of battle or on the seas.

=the espionage and sedition acts.=--by the espionage law of june 15,
1917, and the amending law, known as the sedition act, passed in may of
the following year, the government was given a drastic power over the
expression of opinion. the first measure penalized those who conveyed
information to a foreign country to be used to the injury of the united
states; those who made false statements designed to interfere with the
military or naval forces of the united states; those who attempted to
stir up insubordination or disloyalty in the army and navy; and those
who willfully obstructed enlistment. the sedition act was still more
severe and sweeping in its terms. it imposed heavy penalties upon any
person who used "abusive language about the government or institutions
of the country." it authorized the dismissal of any officer of the
government who committed "disloyal acts" or uttered "disloyal language,"
and empowered the postmaster general to close the mails to persons
violating the law. this measure, prepared by the department of justice,
encountered vigorous opposition in the senate, where twenty-four
republicans and two democrats voted against it. senator johnson of
california denounced it as a law "to suppress the freedom of the press
in the united states and to prevent any man, no matter who he is, from
expressing legitimate criticism concerning the present government." the
constitutionality of the acts was attacked; but they were sustained by
the supreme court and stringently enforced.

=labor and the war.=--in view of the restlessness of european labor
during the war and especially the proletarian revolution in russia in
november, 1917, some anxiety was early expressed as to the stand which
organized labor might take in the united states. it was, however, soon
dispelled. samuel gompers, speaking for the american federation of
labor, declared that "this is labor's war," and pledged the united
support of all the unions. there was some dissent. the socialist party
denounced the war as a capitalist quarrel; but all the protests combined
were too slight to have much effect. american labor leaders were sent to
europe to strengthen the wavering ranks of trade unionists in war-worn
england, france, and italy. labor was given representation on the
important boards and commissions dealing with industrial questions.
trade union standards were accepted by the government and generally
applied in industry. the department of labor became one of the powerful
war centers of the nation. in a memorable address to the american
federation of labor, president wilson assured the trade unionists that
labor conditions should not be made unduly onerous by the war and
received in return a pledge of loyalty from the federation. recognition
of labor's contribution to winning the war was embodied in the treaty of
peace, which provided for a permanent international organization to
promote the world-wide effort of labor to improve social conditions.
"the league of nations has for its object the establishment of universal
peace," runs the preamble to the labor section of the treaty, "and such
a peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice....
the failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labor is an
obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the
conditions in their own countries."

=the american navy in the war.=--as soon as congress declared war the
fleet was mobilized, american ports were thrown open to the warships of
the allies, immediate provision was made for increasing the number of
men and ships, and a contingent of war vessels was sent to cooperate
with the british and french in their life-and-death contest with
submarines. special effort was made to stimulate the production of
"submarine chasers" and "scout cruisers" to be sent to the danger zone.
convoys were provided to accompany the transports conveying soldiers to
france. before the end of the war more than three hundred american
vessels and 75,000 officers and men were operating in european waters.
though the german fleet failed to come out and challenge the sea power
of the allies, the battleships of the united states were always ready to
do their full duty in such an event. as things turned out, the service
of the american navy was limited mainly to helping in the campaign that
wore down the submarine menace to allied shipping.

=the war in france.=--owing to the peculiar character of the warfare in
france, it required a longer time for american military forces to get
into action; but there was no unnecessary delay. soon after the
declaration of war, steps were taken to give military assistance to the
allies. the regular army was enlarged and the troops of the national
guard were brought into national service. on june 13, general john j.
pershing, chosen head of the american expeditionary forces, reached
paris and began preparations for the arrival of our troops. in june, the
vanguard of the army reached france. a slow and steady stream followed.
as soon as the men enrolled under the draft were ready, it became a
flood. during the period of the war the army was enlarged from about
190,000 men to 3,665,000, of whom more than 2,000,000 were in france
when the armistice was signed.

although american troops did not take part on a large scale until the
last phase of the war in 1918, several battalions of infantry were in
the trenches by october, 1917, and had their first severe encounter with
the germans early in november. in january, 1918, they took over a part
of the front line as an american sector. in march, general pershing
placed our forces at the disposal of general foch, commander-in-chief of
the allied armies. the first division, which entered the montdidier
salient in april, soon was engaged with the enemy, "taking with splendid
dash the town of cantigny and all other objectives, which were organized
and held steadfastly against vicious counter attacks and galling
artillery fire."

[illustration: _copyright by underwood and underwood, n.y._

troops returning from france]

when the germans launched their grand drives toward the marne and paris,
in june and july, 1918, every available man was placed at general foch's
command. at belleau wood, at chateau-thierry, and other points along the
deep salient made by the germans into the french lines, american
soldiers distinguished themselves by heroic action. they also played an
important role in the counter attack that "smashed" the salient and
drove the germans back.

in september, american troops, with french aid, "wiped out" the german
salient at st. mihiel. by this time general pershing was ready for the
great american drive to the northeast in the argonne forest, while he
also cooperated with the british in the assault on the hindenburg line.
in the meuse-argonne battle, our soldiers encountered some of the most
severe fighting of the war and pressed forward steadily against the most
stubborn resistance from the enemy. on the 6th of november, reported
general pershing, "a division of the first corps reached a point on the
meuse opposite sedan, twenty-five miles from our line of departure. the
strategical goal which was our highest hope was gained. we had cut the
enemy's main line of communications and nothing but a surrender or an
armistice could save his army from complete disaster." five days later
the end came. on the morning of november 11, the order to cease firing
went into effect. the german army was in rapid retreat and
demoralization had begun. the kaiser had abdicated and fled into
holland. the hohenzollern dreams of empire were shattered. in the
fifty-second month, the world war, involving nearly every civilized
nation on the globe, was brought to a close. more than 75,000 american
soldiers and sailors had given their lives. more than 250,000 had been
wounded or were missing or in german prison camps.

the settlement at paris

=the peace conference.=--on january 18, 1919, a conference of the allied
and associated powers assembled to pronounce judgment upon the german
empire and its defeated satellites: austria-hungary, bulgaria, and
turkey. it was a moving spectacle. seventy-two delegates spoke for
thirty-two states. the united states, great britain, france, italy, and
japan had five delegates each. belgium, brazil, and serbia were each
assigned three. canada, australia, south africa, india, china, greece,
hedjaz, poland, portugal, rumania, siam, and czechoslovakia were
allotted two apiece. the remaining states of new zealand, bolivia, cuba,
ecuador, guatemala, haiti, honduras, liberia, nicaragua, panama, peru,
and uruguay each had one delegate. president wilson spoke in person for
the united states. england, france, and italy were represented by their
premiers: david lloyd george, georges clemenceau, and vittorio orlando.

=the supreme council.=--the real work of the settlement was first
committed to a supreme council of ten representing the united states,
great britain, france, italy, and japan. this was later reduced to five
members. then japan dropped out and finally italy, leaving only
president wilson and the premiers, lloyd george and clemenceau, the
"big three," who assumed the burden of mighty decisions. on may 6, their
work was completed and in a secret session of the full conference the
whole treaty of peace was approved, though a few of the powers made
reservations or objections. the next day the treaty was presented to the
germans who, after prolonged protests, signed on the last day of grace,
june 28. this german treaty was followed by agreements with austria,
hungary, bulgaria, and turkey. collectively these great documents formed
the legal basis of the general european settlement.

=the terms of the settlement.=--the combined treaties make a huge
volume. the german treaty alone embraces about 80,000 words.
collectively they cover an immense range of subjects which may be
summarized under five heads: (1) the territorial settlement in europe;
(2) the destruction of german military power; (3) reparations for
damages done by germany and her allies; (4) the disposition of german
colonies and protectorates; and (5) the league of nations.

germany was reduced by the cession of alsace-lorraine to france and the
loss of several other provinces. austria-hungary was dissolved and
dismembered. russia was reduced by the creation of new states on the
west. bulgaria was stripped of her gains in the recent balkan wars.
turkey was dismembered. nine new independent states were created:
poland, finland, lithuania, latvia, esthonia, ukraine, czechoslovakia,
armenia, and hedjaz. italy, greece, rumania, and serbia were enlarged by
cessions of territory and serbia was transformed into the great state of
jugoslavia.

the destruction of german military power was thorough. the entire navy,
with minor exceptions, was turned over to the allied and associated
powers; germany's total equipment for the future was limited to six
battleships and six light cruisers, with certain small vessels but no
submarines. the number of enlisted men and officers for the army was
fixed at not more than 100,000; the general staff was dissolved; and the
manufacture of munitions restricted.

germany was compelled to accept full responsibility for all damages; to
pay five billion dollars in cash and goods, and to make certain other
payments which might be ordered from time to time by an inter-allied
reparations commission. she was also required to deliver to belgium,
france, and italy, millions of tons of coal every year for ten years;
while by way of additional compensation to france the rich coal basin of
the saar was placed under inter-allied control to be exploited under
french administration for a period of at least fifteen years. austria
and the other associates of germany were also laid under heavy
obligations to the victors. damages done to shipping by submarines and
other vessels were to be paid for on the basis of ton for ton.

the disposition of the german colonies and the old ottoman empire
presented knotty problems. it was finally agreed that the german
colonies and turkish provinces which were in a backward stage of
development should be placed under the tutelage of certain powers acting
as "mandatories" holding them in "a sacred trust of civilization." an
exception to the mandatory principle arose in the case of german rights
in shantung, all of which were transferred directly to japan. it was
this arrangement that led the chinese delegation to withhold their
signatures from the treaty.

=the league of nations.=--high among the purposes which he had in mind
in summoning the nation to arms, president wilson placed the desire to
put an end to war. all through the united states the people spoke of the
"war to end war." no slogan called forth a deeper response from the
public. the president himself repeatedly declared that a general
association of nations must be formed to guard the peace and protect all
against the ambitions of the few. "as i see it," he said in his address
on opening the fourth liberty loan campaign, "the constitution of the
league of nations and the clear definition of its objects must be a
part, in a sense the most essential part, of the peace settlement
itself."

nothing was more natural, therefore, than wilson's insistence at paris
upon the formation of an international association. indeed he had gone
to europe in person largely to accomplish that end. part one of the
treaty with germany, the covenant of the league of nations, was due to
his labors more than to any other influence. within the league thus
created were to be embraced all the allied and associated powers and
nearly all the neutrals. by a two-thirds vote of the league assembly the
excluded nations might be admitted.

the agencies of the league of nations were to be three in number: (1) a
permanent secretariat located at geneva; (2) an assembly consisting of
one delegate from each country, dominion, or self-governing colony
(including canada, australia, south africa, new zealand, and india); (3)
and a council consisting of representatives of the united states, great
britain, france, italy, and japan, and four other representatives
selected by the assembly from time to time.

the duties imposed on the league and the obligations accepted by its
members were numerous and important. the council was to take steps to
formulate a scheme for the reduction of armaments and to submit a plan
for the establishment of a permanent court of international justice. the
members of the league (article x) were to respect and preserve as
against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing
political independence of all the associated nations. they were to
submit to arbitration or inquiry by the council all disputes which could
not be adjusted by diplomacy and in no case to resort to war until three
months after the award. should any member disregard its covenants, its
action would be considered an act of war against the league, which would
accordingly cut off the trade and business of the hostile member and
recommend through the council to the several associated governments the
military measures to be taken. in case the decision in any arbitration
of a dispute was unanimous, the members of the league affected by it
were to abide by it.

such was the settlement at paris and such was the association of nations
formed to promote the peace of the world. they were quickly approved by
most of the powers, and the first assembly of the league of nations met
at geneva late in 1920.

=the treaty in the united states.=--when the treaty was presented to the
united states senate for approval, a violent opposition appeared. in
that chamber the republicans had a slight majority and a two-thirds vote
was necessary for ratification. the sentiment for and against the treaty
ran mainly along party lines; but the republicans were themselves
divided. the major portion, known as "reservationists," favored
ratification with certain conditions respecting american rights; while a
small though active minority rejected the league of nations in its
entirety, announcing themselves to be "irreconcilables." the grounds of
this republican opposition lay partly in the terms of peace imposed on
germany and partly in the covenant of the league of nations. exception
was taken to the clauses which affected the rights of american citizens
in property involved in the adjustment with germany, but the burden of
criticism was directed against the league. article x guaranteeing
against external aggression the political independence and territorial
integrity of the members of the league was subjected to a specially
heavy fire; while the treatment accorded to china and the sections
affecting american internal affairs were likewise attacked as "unjust
and dangerous." as an outcome of their deliberations, the republicans
proposed a long list of reservations which touched upon many of the
vital parts of the treaty. these were rejected by president wilson as
amounting in effect to a "nullification of the treaty." as a deadlock
ensued the treaty was definitely rejected, owing to the failure of its
sponsors to secure the requisite two-thirds vote.

[illustration: europe]

=the league of nations in the campaign of 1920.=--at this juncture the
presidential campaign of 1920 opened. the republicans, while condemning
the terms of the proposed league, endorsed the general idea of an
international agreement to prevent war. their candidate, senator
warren g. harding of ohio, maintained a similar position without saying
definitely whether the league devised at paris could be recast in such a
manner as to meet his requirements. the democrats, on the other hand,
while not opposing limitations clarifying the obligations of the united
states, demanded "the immediate ratification of the treaty without
reservations which would impair its essential integrity." the democratic
candidate, governor james m. cox, of ohio, announced his firm conviction
that the united states should "go into the league," without closing the
door to mild reservations; he appealed to the country largely on that
issue. the election of senator harding, in an extraordinary "landslide,"
coupled with the return of a majority of republicans to the senate, made
uncertain american participation in the league of nations.

=the united states and international entanglements.=--whether america
entered the league or not, it could not close its doors to the world and
escape perplexing international complications. it had ever-increasing
financial and commercial connections with all other countries. our
associates in the recent war were heavily indebted to our government.
the prosperity of american industries depended to a considerable extent
upon the recovery of the impoverished and battle-torn countries of
europe.

there were other complications no less specific. the united states was
compelled by force of circumstances to adopt a russian policy. the
government of the czar had been overthrown by a liberal revolution,
which in turn had been succeeded by an extreme, communist
"dictatorship." the bolsheviki, or majority faction of the socialists,
had obtained control of the national council of peasants, workingmen,
and soldiers, called the soviet, and inaugurated a radical regime. they
had made peace with germany in march, 1918. thereupon the united states
joined england, france, and japan in an unofficial war upon them. after
the general settlement at paris in 1919, our government, while
withdrawing troops from siberia and archangel, continued in its refusal
to recognize the bolshevists or to permit unhampered trade with them.
president wilson repeatedly denounced them as the enemies of
civilization and undertook to lay down for all countries the principles
which should govern intercourse with russia.

further international complications were created in connection with the
world war, wholly apart from the terms of peace or the league of
nations. the united states had participated in a general european
conflict which changed the boundaries of countries, called into being
new nations, and reduced the power and territories of the vanquished.
accordingly, it was bound to face the problem of how far it was prepared
to cooperate with the victors in any settlement of europe's
difficulties. by no conceivable process, therefore, could america be
disentangled from the web of world affairs. isolation, if desirable, had
become impossible. within three hundred years from the founding of the
tiny settlements at jamestown and plymouth, america, by virtue of its
institutions, its population, its wealth, and its commerce, had become
first among the nations of the earth. by moral obligations and by
practical interests its fate was thus linked with the destiny of all
mankind.


summary of democracy and the world war

the astounding industrial progress that characterized the period
following the civil war bequeathed to the new generation many perplexing
problems connected with the growth of trusts and railways, the
accumulation of great fortunes, the increase of poverty in the
industrial cities, the exhaustion of the free land, and the acquisition
of dominions in distant seas. as long as there was an abundance of land
in the west any able-bodied man with initiative and industry could
become an independent farmer. people from the cities and immigrants from
europe had always before them that gateway to property and prosperity.
when the land was all gone, american economic conditions inevitably
became more like those of europe.

though the new economic questions had been vigorously debated in many
circles before his day, it was president roosevelt who first discussed
them continuously from the white house. the natural resources of the
country were being exhausted; he advocated their conservation. huge
fortunes were being made in business creating inequalities in
opportunity; he favored reducing them by income and inheritance taxes.
industries were disturbed by strikes; he pressed arbitration upon
capital and labor. the free land was gone; he declared that labor was in
a less favorable position to bargain with capital and therefore should
organize in unions for collective bargaining. there had been wrong-doing
on the part of certain great trusts; those responsible should be
punished.

the spirit of reform was abroad in the land. the spoils system was
attacked. it was alleged that the political parties were dominated by
"rings and bosses." the united states senate was called "a millionaires'
club." poverty and misery were observed in the cities. state
legislatures and city governments were accused of corruption.

in answer to the charges, remedies were proposed and adopted. civil
service reform was approved. the australian ballot, popular election of
senators, the initiative, referendum, and recall, commission and city
manager plans for cities, public regulation of railways, compensation
for those injured in industries, minimum wages for women and children,
pensions for widows, the control of housing in the cities--these and a
hundred other reforms were adopted and tried out. the national watchword
became: "america, improve thyself."

the spirit of reform broke into both political parties. it appeared in
many statutes enacted by congress under president taft's leadership. it
disrupted the republicans temporarily in 1912 when the progressive party
entered the field. it led the democratic candidate in that year,
governor wilson, to make a "progressive appeal" to the voters. it
inspired a considerable program of national legislation under president
wilson's two administrations.

in the age of change, four important amendments to the federal
constitution, the first in more than forty years, were adopted. the
sixteenth empowered congress to lay an income tax. the seventeenth
assured popular election of senators. the eighteenth made prohibition
national. the nineteenth, following upon the adoption of woman suffrage
in many states, enfranchised the women of the nation.

in the sphere of industry, equally great changes took place. the major
portion of the nation's business passed into the hands of corporations.
in all the leading industries of the country labor was organized into
trade unions and federated in a national organization. the power of
organized capital and organized labor loomed upon the horizon. their
struggles, their rights, and their place in the economy of the nation
raised problems of the first magnitude.

while the country was engaged in a heated debate upon its domestic
issues, the world war broke out in europe in 1914. as a hundred years
before, american rights upon the high seas became involved at once. they
were invaded on both sides; but germany, in addition to assailing
american ships and property, ruthlessly destroyed american lives. she
set at naught the rules of civilized warfare upon the sea. warnings from
president wilson were without avail. nothing could stay the hand of the
german war party.

after long and patient negotiations, president wilson in 1917 called
upon the nation to take up arms against an assailant that had in effect
declared war upon america. the answer was swift and firm. the national
resources, human and material, were mobilized. the navy was enlarged, a
draft army created, huge loans floated, heavy taxes laid, and the spirit
of sacrifice called forth in a titanic struggle against an autocratic
power that threatened to dominate europe and the world.

in the end, american financial, naval, and military assistance counted
heavily in the scale. american sailors scoured the seas searching for
the terrible submarines. american soldiers took part in the last great
drives that broke the might of germany's army. such was the nation's
response to the president's summons to arms in a war "for democracy" and
"to end war."

when victory crowned the arms of the powers united against germany,
president wilson in person took part in the peace council. he sought to
redeem his pledge to end wars by forming a league of nations to keep the
peace. in the treaty drawn at the close of the war the first part was a
covenant binding the nations in a permanent association for the
settlement of international disputes. this treaty, the president offered
to the united states senate for ratification and to his country for
approval.

once again, as in the days of the napoleonic wars, the people seriously
discussed the place of america among the powers of the earth. the senate
refused to ratify the treaty. world politics then became an issue in the
campaign of 1920. though some americans talked as if the united states
could close its doors and windows against all mankind, the victor in the
election, senator harding, of ohio, knew better. the election returns
were hardly announced before he began to ask the advice of his
countrymen on the pressing theme that would not be downed: "what part
shall america--first among the nations of the earth in wealth and
power--assume at the council table of the world?"

during the recess of the senate, by granting commissions which shall

congress shall make.

3. the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by

a topical syllabus

as a result of a wholesome reaction against the purely chronological
treatment of history, there is now a marked tendency in the direction of
a purely topical handling of the subject. the topical method, however,
may also be pushed too far. each successive stage of any topic can be
understood only in relation to the forces of the time. for that reason,
the best results are reached when there is a combination of the
chronological and the topical methods. it is therefore suggested that
the teacher first follow the text closely and then review the subject
with the aid of this topical syllabus. the references are to pages.

section 4.  information about donations to the project gutenberg
literary archive foundation

project gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs.

the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states.  compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  to
send donations or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the united states.  u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.

please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  to donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

preface to sixth edition


much has happened since this manual was last revised, and many surgical
lessons have been learned in the hard school of war. some may yet have
to be unlearned, and others have but little bearing on the problems
presented to the civilian surgeon. save in its broadest principles, the
surgery of warfare is a thing apart from the general surgery of civil
life, and the exhaustive literature now available on every aspect of it
makes it unnecessary that it should receive detailed consideration in a
manual for students. in preparing this new edition, therefore, we have
endeavoured to incorporate only such additions to our knowledge and
resources as our experience leads us to believe will prove of permanent
value in civil practice.

for the rest, the text has been revised, condensed, and in places
rearranged; a number of old illustrations have been discarded, and a
greater number of new ones added. descriptions of operative procedures
have been omitted from the _manual_, as they are to be found in the
companion volume on _operative surgery_, the third edition of which
appeared some months ago.

we have retained the basle anatomical nomenclature, as extended
experience has confirmed our preference for it. for the convenience of
readers who still employ the old terms, these are given in brackets
after the new.

this edition of the _manual_ appears in three volumes; the first being
devoted to general surgery, the other two to regional surgery. this
arrangement has enabled us to deal in a more consecutive manner than
hitherto with the surgery of the extremities, including fractures and
dislocations.

we have once more to express our thanks to colleagues in the edinburgh
school and to other friends for aiding us in providing new
illustrations, and for other valuable help, as well as to our publishers
for their generosity in the matter of illustrations.

edinburgh,
    _march_ 1921.

introduction

to prolong human life and to alleviate suffering are the ultimate
objects of scientific medicine. the two great branches of the healing
art--medicine and surgery--are so intimately related that it is
impossible to draw a hard-and-fast line between them, but for
convenience surgery may be defined as "the art of treating lesions and
malformations of the human body by manual operations, mediate and
immediate." to apply his art intelligently and successfully, it is
essential that the surgeon should be conversant not only with the normal
anatomy and physiology of the body and with the various pathological
conditions to which it is liable, but also with the nature of the
process by which repair of injured or diseased tissues is effected.
without this knowledge he is unable to recognise such deviations from
the normal as result from mal-development, injury, or disease, or
rationally to direct his efforts towards the correction or removal of
these.


process of repair

the process of repair in living tissue depends upon an inherent power
possessed by vital cells of reacting to the irritation caused by injury
or disease. the cells of the damaged tissues, under the influence of
this irritation, undergo certain proliferative changes, which are
designed to restore the normal structure and configuration of the part.
the process by which this restoration is effected is essentially the
same in all tissues, but the extent to which different tissues can carry
the recuperative process varies. simple structures, such as skin,
cartilage, bone, periosteum, and tendon, for example, have a high power
of regeneration, and in them the reparative process may result in almost
perfect restitution to the normal. more complex structures, on the other
hand, such as secreting glands, muscle, and the tissues of the central
nervous system, are but imperfectly restored, simple cicatricial
connective tissue taking the place of what has been lost or destroyed.
any given tissue can be replaced only by tissue of a similar kind, and
in a damaged part each element takes its share in the reparative process
by producing new material which approximates more or less closely to the
normal according to the recuperative capacity of the particular tissue.
the normal process of repair may be interfered with by various
extraneous agencies, the most important of which are infection by
disease-producing micro-organisms, the presence of foreign substances,
undue movement of the affected part, and improper applications and
dressings. the effect of these agencies is to delay repair or to prevent
the individual tissues carrying the process to the furthest degree of
which they are capable.

in the management of wounds and other diseased conditions the main
object of the surgeon is to promote the natural reparative process by
preventing or eliminating any factor by which it may be disturbed.

#healing by primary union.#--the most favourable conditions for the
progress of the reparative process are to be found in a clean-cut wound
of the integument, which is uncomplicated by loss of tissue, by the
presence of foreign substances, or by infection with disease-producing
micro-organisms, and its edges are in contact. such a wound in virtue of
the absence of infection is said to be _aseptic_, and under these
conditions healing takes place by what is called "primary union"--the
"healing by first intention" of the older writers.

#granulation tissue.#--the essential and invariable medium of repair in
all structures is an elementary form of new tissue known as _granulation
tissue_, which is produced in the damaged area in response to the
irritation caused by injury or disease. the vital reaction induced by
such irritation results in dilatation of the vessels of the part,
emigration of leucocytes, transudation of lymph, and certain
proliferative changes in the fixed tissue cells. these changes are
common to the processes of inflammation and repair; no hard-and-fast
line can be drawn between these processes, and the two may go on
together. it is, however, only when the proliferative changes have come
to predominate that the reparative process is effectively established by
the production of healthy granulation tissue.

_formation of granulation tissue._--when a wound is made in the
integument under aseptic conditions, the passage of the knife through
the tissues is immediately followed by an oozing of blood, which soon
coagulates on the cut surfaces. in each of the divided vessels a clot
forms, and extends as far as the nearest collateral branch; and on the
surface of the wound there is a microscopic layer of bruised and
devitalised tissue. if the wound is closed, the narrow space between its
edges is occupied by blood-clot, which consists of red and white
corpuscles mixed with a quantity of fibrin, and this forms a temporary
uniting medium between the divided surfaces. during the first twelve
hours, the minute vessels in the vicinity of the wound dilate, and from
them lymph exudes and leucocytes migrate into the tissues. in from
twenty-four to thirty-six hours, the capillaries of the part adjacent to
the wound begin to throw out minute buds and fine processes, which
bridge the gap and form a firmer, but still temporary, connection
between the two sides. each bud begins in the wall of the capillary as a
small accumulation of granular protoplasm, which gradually elongates
into a filament containing a nucleus. this filament either joins with a
neighbouring capillary or with a similar filament, and in time these
become hollow and are filled with blood from the vessels that gave them
origin. in this way a series of young _capillary loops_ is formed.

the spaces between these loops are filled by cells of various kinds, the
most important being the _fibroblasts_, which are destined to form
cicatricial fibrous tissue. these fibroblasts are large irregular
nucleated cells derived mainly from the proliferation of the fixed
connective-tissue cells of the part, and to a less extent from the
lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells which have migrated from the
vessels. among the fibroblasts, larger multi-nucleated cells--_giant
cells_--are sometimes found, particularly when resistant substances,
such as silk ligatures or fragments of bone, are embedded in the
tissues, and their function seems to be to soften such substances
preliminary to their being removed by the phagocytes. numerous
_polymorpho-nuclear leucocytes_, which have wandered from the vessels,
are also present in the spaces. these act as phagocytes, their function
being to remove the red corpuscles and fibrin of the original clot, and
this performed, they either pass back into the circulation in virtue of
their amoeboid movement, or are themselves eaten up by the growing
fibroblasts. beyond this phagocytic action, they do not appear to play
any direct part in the reparative process. these young capillary loops,
with their supporting cells and fluids, constitute granulation tissue,
which is usually fully formed in from three to five days, after which it
begins to be replaced by cicatricial or scar tissue.

_formation of cicatricial tissue._--the transformation of this temporary
granulation tissue into scar tissue is effected by the fibroblasts,
which become elongated and spindle-shaped, and produce in and around
them a fine fibrillated material which gradually increases in quantity
till it replaces the cell protoplasm. in this way white fibrous tissue
is formed, the cells of which are arranged in parallel lines and
eventually become grouped in bundles, constituting fully formed white
fibrous tissue. in its growth it gradually obliterates the capillaries,
until at the end of two, three, or four weeks both vessels and cells
have almost entirely disappeared, and the original wound is occupied by
cicatricial tissue. in course of time this tissue becomes consolidated,
and the cicatrix undergoes a certain amount of contraction--_cicatricial
contraction_.

_healing of epidermis._--while these changes are taking place in the
deeper parts of the wound, the surface is being covered over by
_epidermis_ growing in from the margins. within twelve hours the cells
of the rete malpighii close to the cut edge begin to sprout on to the
surface of the wound, and by their proliferation gradually cover the
granulations with a thin pink pellicle. as the epithelium increases in
thickness it assumes a bluish hue and eventually the cells become
cornified and the epithelium assumes a greyish-white colour.

_clinical aspects._--so long as the process of repair is not complicated
by infection with micro-organisms, there is no interference with the
general health of the patient. the temperature remains normal; the
circulatory, gastro-intestinal, nervous, and other functions are
undisturbed; locally, the part is cool, of natural colour and free from
pain.

#modifications of the process of repair.#--the process of repair by
primary union, above described, is to be looked upon as the type of all
reparative processes, such modifications as are met with depending
merely upon incidental differences in the conditions present, such as
loss of tissue, infection by micro-organisms, etc.

_repair after loss or destruction of tissue._--when the edges of a wound
cannot be approximated either because tissue has been lost, for example
in excising a tumour or because a drainage tube or gauze packing has
been necessary, a greater amount of granulation tissue is required to
fill the gap, but the process is essentially the same as in the ideal
method of repair.

the raw surface is first covered by a layer of coagulated blood and
fibrin. an extensive new formation of capillary loops and fibroblasts
takes place towards the free surface, and goes on until the gap is
filled by a fine velvet-like mass of granulation tissue. this
granulation tissue is gradually replaced by young cicatricial tissue,
and the surface is covered by the ingrowth of epithelium from the edges.

this modification of the reparative process can be best studied
clinically in a recent wound which has been packed with gauze. when the
plug is introduced, the walls of the cavity consist of raw tissue with
numerous oozing blood vessels. on removing the packing on the fifth or
sixth day, the surface is found to be covered with minute, red,
papillary granulations, which are beginning to fill up the cavity. at
the edges the epithelium has proliferated and is covering over the newly
formed granulation tissue. as lymph and leucocytes escape from the
exposed surface there is a certain amount of serous or sero-purulent
discharge. on examining the wound at intervals of a few days, it is
found that the granulation tissue gradually increases in amount till the
gap is completely filled up, and that coincidently the epithelium
spreads in and covers over its surface. in course of time the epithelium
thickens, and as the granulation tissue is slowly replaced by young
cicatricial tissue, which has a peculiar tendency to contract and so to
obliterate the blood vessels in it, the scar that is left becomes
smooth, pale, and depressed. this method of healing is sometimes spoken
of as "healing by granulation"--although, as we have seen, it is by
granulation that all repair takes place.

_healing by union of two granulating surfaces._--in gaping wounds union
is sometimes obtained by bringing the two surfaces into apposition after
each has become covered with healthy granulations. the exudate on the
surfaces causes them to adhere, capillary loops pass from one to the
other, and their final fusion takes place by the further development of
granulation and cicatricial tissue.

_reunion of parts entirely separated from the body._--small portions of
tissue, such as the end of a finger, the tip of the nose or a portion of
the external ear, accidentally separated from the body, if accurately
replaced and fixed in position, occasionally adhere by primary union.

in the course of operations also, portions of skin, fascia, or bone, or
even a complete joint may be transplanted, and unite by primary union.

_healing under a scab._--when a small superficial wound is exposed to
the air, the blood and serum exuded on its surface may dry and form a
hard crust or _scab_, which serves to protect the surface from external
irritation in the same way as would a dry pad of sterilised gauze. under
this scab the formation of granulation tissue, its transformation into
cicatricial tissue, and the growth of epithelium on the surface, go on
until in the course of time the crust separates, leaving a scar.

_healing by blood-clot._--in subcutaneous wounds, for example tenotomy,
in amputation wounds, and in wounds made in excising tumours or in
operating upon bones, the space left between the divided tissues becomes
filled with blood-clot, which acts as a temporary scaffolding in which
granulation tissue is built up. capillary loops grow into the coagulum,
and migrated leucocytes from the adjacent blood vessels destroy the red
corpuscles, and are in turn disposed of by the developing fibroblasts,
which by their growth and proliferation fill up the gap with young
connective tissue. it will be evident that this process only differs
from healing by primary union in the _amount_ of blood-clot that is
present.

_presence of a foreign body._--when an aseptic foreign body is present
in the tissues, _e.g._ a piece of unabsorbable chromicised catgut, the
healing process may be modified. after primary union has taken place the
scar may broaden, become raised above the surface, and assume a
bluish-brown colour; the epidermis gradually thins and gives way,
revealing the softened portion of catgut, which can be pulled out in
pieces, after which the wound rapidly heals and resumes a normal
appearance.


repair in individual tissues

_skin and connective tissue._--the mode of regeneration of these tissues
under aseptic conditions has already been described as the type of ideal
repair. in highly vascular parts, such as the face, the reparative
process goes on with great rapidity, and even extensive wounds may be
firmly united in from three to five days. where the anastomosis is less
free the process is more prolonged. the more highly organised elements
of the skin, such as the hair follicles, the sweat and sebaceous glands,
are imperfectly reproduced; hence the scar remains smooth, dry, and
hairless.

_epithelium._--epithelium is only reproduced from pre-existing
epithelium, and, as a rule, from one of a similar type, although
metaplastic transformation of cells of one kind of epithelium into
another kind can take place. thus a granulating surface may be covered
entirely by the ingrowing of the cutaneous epithelium from the margins;
or islets, originating in surviving cells of sebaceous glands or sweat
glands, or of hair follicles, may spring up in the centre of the raw
area. such islets may also be due to the accidental transference of
loose epithelial cells from the edges. even the fluid from a blister, in
virtue of the isolated cells of the rete malpighii which it contains, is
capable of starting epithelial growth on a granulating surface. hairs
and nails may be completely regenerated if a sufficient amount of the
hair follicles or of the nail matrix has escaped destruction. the
epithelium of a mucous membrane is regenerated in the same way as that
on a cutaneous surface.

epithelial cells have the power of living for some time after being
separated from their normal surroundings, and of growing again when once
more placed in favourable circumstances. on this fact the practice of
skin grafting is based (p. 11).

_cartilage._--when an articular cartilage is divided by incision or by
being implicated in a fracture involving the articular end of a bone, it
is repaired by ordinary cicatricial fibrous tissue derived from the
proliferating cells of the perichondrium. cartilage being a non-vascular
tissue, the reparative process goes on slowly, and it may be many weeks
before it is complete.

it is possible for a metaplastic transformation of connective-tissue
cells into cartilage cells to take place, the characteristic hyaline
matrix being secreted by the new cells. this is sometimes observed as an
intermediary stage in the healing of fractures, especially in young
bones. it may also take place in the regeneration of lost portions of
cartilage, provided the new tissue is so situated as to constitute part
of a joint and to be subjected to pressure by an opposing cartilaginous
surface. this is illustrated by what takes place after excision of
joints where it is desired to restore the function of the articulation.
by carrying out movements between the constituent parts, the fibrous
tissue covering the ends of the bones becomes moulded into shape, its
cells take on the characters of cartilage cells, and, forming a matrix,
so develop a new cartilage.

conversely, it is observed that when articular cartilage is no longer
subjected to pressure by an opposing cartilage, it tends to be
transformed into fibrous tissue, as may be seen in deformities attended
with displacement of articular surfaces, such as hallux valgus and
club-foot.

after fractures of costal cartilage or of the cartilages of the larynx
the cicatricial tissue may be ultimately replaced by bone.

_tendons._--when a tendon is divided, for example by subcutaneous
tenotomy, the end nearer the muscle fibres is drawn away from the other,
leaving a gap which is speedily filled by blood-clot. in the course of a
few days this clot becomes permeated by granulation tissue, the
fibroblasts of which are derived from the sheath of the tendon, the
surrounding connective tissue, and probably also from the divided ends
of the tendon itself. these fibroblasts ultimately develop into typical
tendon cells, and the fibres which they form constitute the new tendon
fibres. under aseptic conditions repair is complete in from two to three
weeks. in the course of the reparative process the tendon and its sheath
may become adherent, which leads to impaired movement and stiffness. if
the ends of an accidentally divided tendon are at once brought into
accurate apposition and secured by sutures, they unite directly with a
minimum amount of scar tissue, and function is perfectly restored.

_muscle._--unstriped muscle does not seem to be capable of being
regenerated to any but a moderate degree. if the ends of a divided
striped muscle are at once brought into apposition by stitches, primary
union takes place with a minimum of intervening fibrous tissue. the
nuclei of the muscle fibres in close proximity to this young cicatricial
tissue proliferate, and a few new muscle fibres may be developed, but
any gross loss of muscular tissue is replaced by a fibrous cicatrix. it
would appear that portions of muscle transplanted from animals to fill
up gaps in human muscle are similarly replaced by fibrous tissue. when a
muscle is paralysed from loss of its nerve supply and undergoes complete
degeneration, it is not capable of being regenerated, even should the
integrity of the nerve be restored, and so its function is permanently
lost.

_secretory glands._--the regeneration of secretory glands is usually
incomplete, cicatricial tissue taking the place of the glandular
substance which has been destroyed. in wounds of the liver, for example,
the gap is filled by fibrous tissue, but towards the periphery of the

wound the liver cells proliferate and a certain amount of regeneration
takes place. in the kidney also, repair mainly takes place by
cicatricial tissue, and although a few collecting tubules may be
reformed, no regeneration of secreting tissue takes place. after the
operation of decapsulation of the kidney a new capsule is formed, and
during the process young blood vessels permeate the superficial parts
of the kidney and temporarily increase its blood supply, but in the
consolidation of the new fibrous tissue these vessels are ultimately
obliterated. this does not prove that the operation is useless, as the
temporary improvement of the circulation in the kidney may serve to tide
the patient over a critical period of renal insufficiency.

_stomach and intestine._--provided the peritoneal surfaces are
accurately apposed, wounds of the stomach and intestine heal with great
rapidity. within a few hours the peritoneal surfaces are glued together
by a thin layer of fibrin and leucocytes, which is speedily organised
and replaced by fibrous tissue. fibrous tissue takes the place of the
muscular elements, which are not regenerated. the mucous lining is
restored by ingrowth from the margins, and there is evidence that some
of the secreting glands may be reproduced.

hollow viscera, like the oesophagus and urinary bladder, in so far
as they are not covered by peritoneum, heal less rapidly.

_nerve tissues._--there is no trustworthy evidence that regeneration of
the tissues of the brain or spinal cord in man ever takes place. any
loss of substance is replaced by cicatricial tissue.

the repair of _bone_, _blood vessels_, and _peripheral nerves_ is more
conveniently considered in the chapters dealing with these structures.

#rate of healing.#--while the rate at which wounds heal is remarkably
constant there are certain factors that influence it in one direction or
the other. healing is more rapid when the edges are in contact, when
there is a minimum amount of blood-clot between them, when the patient
is in normal health and the vitality of the tissues has not been
impaired. wounds heal slightly more quickly in the young than in the
old, although the difference is so small that it can only be
demonstrated by the most careful observations.

certain tissues take longer to heal than others: for example, a fracture
of one of the larger long bones takes about six weeks to unite, and
divided nerve trunks take much longer--about a year.

wounds of certain parts of the body heal more quickly than others: those
of the scalp, face, and neck, for example, heal more quickly than those
over the buttock or sacrum, probably because of their greater
vascularity.

the extent of the wound influences the rate of healing; it is only

natural that a long and deep wound should take longer to heal than a
short and superficial one, because there is so much more work to be
done in the conversion of blood-clot into granulation tissue, and this
again into scar tissue that will be strong enough to stand the strain on
the edges of the wound.


the transplantation or grafting of tissues

conditions are not infrequently met with in which healing is promoted
and restoration of function made possible by the transference of a
portion of tissue from one part of the body to another; the tissue
transferred is known as the _graft_ or the _transplant_. the simplest
example of grafting is the transplantation of skin.

in order that the graft may survive and have a favourable chance of
"taking," as it is called, the transplanted tissue must retain its
vitality until it has formed an organic connection with the tissue in
which it is placed, so that it may derive the necessary nourishment from
its new bed. when these conditions are fulfilled the tissues of the
graft continue to proliferate, producing new tissue elements to replace
those that are lost and making it possible for the graft to become
incorporated with the tissue with which it is in contact.

dead tissue, on the other hand, can do neither of these things; it is
only capable of acting as a model, or, at the most, as a scaffolding for
such mobile tissue elements as may be derived from, the parent tissue
with which the graft is in contact: a portion of sterilised marine
sponge, for example, may be observed to become permeated with
granulation tissue when it is embedded in the tissues.

a successful graft of living tissue is not only capable of regeneration,
but it acquires a system of lymph and blood vessels, so that in time it
bleeds when cut into, and is permeated by new nerve fibres spreading in
from the periphery towards the centre.

it is instructive to associate the period of survival of the different
tissues of the body after death, with their capacity of being used for
grafting purposes; the higher tissues such as those of the central
nervous system and highly specialised glandular tissues like those of
the kidney lose their vitality quickly after death and are therefore
useless for grafting; connective tissues, on the other hand, such as
fat, cartilage, and bone retain their vitality for several hours after
death, so that when they are transplanted, they readily "take" and do
all that is required of them: the same is true of the skin and its
appendages.

_sources of grafts._--it is convenient to differentiate between
_autoplastic_ grafts, that is those derived from the same individual;
_homoplastic_ grafts, derived from another animal of the same species;
and _heteroplastic_ grafts, derived from an animal of another species.
other conditions being equal, the prospects of success are greatest with
autoplastic grafts, and these are therefore preferred whenever possible.

there are certain details making for success that merit attention: the
graft must not be roughly handled or allowed to dry, or be subjected to
chemical irritation; it must be brought into accurate contact with the
new soil, no blood-clot intervening between the two, no movement of the
one upon the other should be possible and all infection must be
excluded; it will be observed that these are exactly the same conditions
that permit of the primary healing of wounds, with which of course the
healing of grafts is exactly comparable.

_preservation of tissues for grafting._--it was at one time believed
that tissues might be taken from the operating theatre and kept in cold
storage until they were required. it is now agreed that tissues which
have been separated from the body for some time inevitably lose their
vitality, become incapable of regeneration, and are therefore unsuited
for grafting purposes. if it is intended to preserve a portion of tissue
for future grafting, it should be embedded in the subcutaneous tissue of
the abdominal wall until it is wanted; this has been carried out with
portions of costal cartilage and of bone.


individual tissues as grafts

#the blood# lends itself in an ideal manner to transplantation, or, as
it has long been called, _transfusion_. being always a homoplastic
transfer, the new blood is not always tolerated by the old, in which
case biochemical changes occur, resulting in haemolysis, which
corresponds to the disintegration of other unsuccessful homoplastic
grafts. (see article on transfusion, _op. surg._, p. 37.)

#the skin.#--the skin was the first tissue to be used for grafting
purposes, and it is still employed with greater frequency than any
other, as lesions causing defects of skin are extremely common and
without the aid of grafts are tedious in healing.

skin grafts may be applied to a raw surface or to one that is covered
with granulations.

_skin grafting of raw surfaces_ is commonly indicated after operations
for malignant disease in which considerable areas of skin must be
sacrificed, and after accidents, such as avulsion of the scalp by
machinery.

_skin grafting of granulating surfaces_ is chiefly employed to promote
healing in the large defects of skin caused by severe burns; the
grafting is carried out when the surface is covered by a uniform layer
of healthy granulations and before the inevitable contraction of scar
tissue makes itself manifest. before applying the grafts it is usual to
scrape away the granulations until the young fibrous tissue underneath
is exposed, but, if the granulations are healthy and can be rendered
aseptic, the grafts may be placed on them directly.

if it is decided to scrape away the granulations, the oozing must be
arrested by pressure with a pad of gauze, a sheet of dental rubber or
green protective is placed next the raw surface to prevent the gauze
adhering and starting the bleeding afresh when it is removed.

#methods of skin-grafting.#--two methods are employed: one in which the
epidermis is mainly or exclusively employed--epidermis or epithelial
grafting; the other, in which the graft consists of the whole thickness
of the true skin--cutis-grafting.

_epidermis or epithelial grafting._--the method introduced by the late
professor thiersch of leipsic is that almost universally practised. it
consists in transplanting strips of epidermis shaved from the surface of
the skin, the razor passing through the tips of the papillae, which
appear as tiny red points yielding a moderate ooze of blood.

the strips are obtained from the front and lateral aspects of the thigh
or upper arm, the skin in those regions being pliable and comparatively
free from hairs.

they are cut with a sharp hollow-ground razor or with thiersch's
grafting knife, the blade of which is rinsed in alcohol and kept
moistened with warm saline solution. the cutting is made easier if the
skin is well stretched and kept flat and perfectly steady, the
operator's left hand exerting traction on the skin behind, the hands of
the assistant on the skin in front, one above and the other below the
seat of operation. to ensure uniform strips being cut, the razor is kept
parallel with the surface and used with a short, rapid, sawing movement,
so that, with a little practice, grafts six or eight inches long by one
or two inches broad can readily be cut. the patient is given a general
anaesthetic, or regional anaesthesia is obtained by injections of a
solution of one per cent. novocain into the line of the lateral and
middle cutaneous nerves; the disinfection of the skin is carried out on
the usual lines, any chemical agent being finally got rid of, however,
by means of alcohol followed by saline solution.

the strips of epidermis wrinkle up on the knife and are directly
transferred to the surface, for which they should be made to form a
complete carpet, slightly overlapping the edges of the area and of one
another; some blunt instrument is used to straighten out the strips,
which are then subjected to firm pressure with a pad of gauze to express
blood and air-bells and to ensure accurate contact, for this must be as
close as that between a postage stamp and the paper to which it is
affixed.

as a dressing for the grafted area and of that also from which the
grafts have been taken, gauze soaked in _liquid paraffin_--the patent
variety known as _ambrine_ is excellent--appears to be the best; the
gauze should be moistened every other day or so with fresh paraffin, so
that, at the end of a week, when the grafts should have united, the
gauze can be removed without risk of detaching them. _dental wax_ is
another useful type of dressing; as is also _picric acid_ solution. over
the gauze, there is applied a thick layer of cotton wool, and the whole
dressing is kept in place by a firmly applied bandage, and in the case
of the limbs some form of splint should be added to prevent movement.

a dressing may be dispensed with altogether, the grafts being protected
by a wire cage such as is used after vaccination, but they tend to dry
up and come to resemble a scab.

when the grafts have healed, it is well to protect them from injury and
to prevent them drying up and cracking by the liberal application of
lanoline or vaseline.

the new skin is at first insensitive and is fixed to the underlying
connective tissue or bone, but in course of time (from six weeks
onwards) sensation returns and the formation of elastic tissue beneath
renders the skin pliant and movable so that it can be pinched up between
the finger and thumb.

_reverdin's_ method consists in planting out pieces of skin not bigger
than a pin-head over a granulating surface. it is seldom employed.

_grafts of the cutis vera._--grafts consisting of the entire thickness
of the true skin were specially advocated by wolff and are often
associated with his name. they should be cut oval or spindle-shaped, to
facilitate the approximation of the edges of the resulting wound. the
graft should be cut to the exact size of the surface it is to cover;
gillies believes that tension of the graft favours its taking. these
grafts may be placed either on a fresh raw surface or on healthy
granulations. it is sometimes an advantage to stitch them in position,
especially on the face. the dressing and the after-treatment are the
same as in epidermis grafting.

there is a degree of uncertainty about the graft retaining its vitality
long enough to permit of its deriving the necessary nourishment from its
new surroundings; in a certain number of cases the flap dies and is
thrown off as a slough--moist or dry according to the presence or
absence of septic infection.

the technique for cutis-grafting must be without a flaw, and the asepsis
absolute; there must not only be a complete absence of movement, but
there must be no traction on the flap that will endanger its blood
supply.

owing to the uncertainty in the results of cutis-grafting the
_two-stage_ or _indirect method_ has been introduced, and its almost
uniform success has led to its sphere of application being widely
extended. the flap is raised as in the direct method but is left
attached at one of its margins for a period ranging from 14 to 21 days
until its blood supply from its new bed is assured; the detachment is
then made complete. the blood supply of the proposed flap may influence
its selection and the way in which it is fashioned; for example, a flap
cut from the side of the head to fill a defect in the cheek, having in
its margin of attachment or pedicle the superficial temporal artery, is
more likely to take than a flap cut with its base above.

another modification is to raise the flap but leave it connected at both
ends like the piers of a bridge; this method is well suited to defects
of skin on the dorsum of the fingers, hand and forearm, the bridge of
skin is raised from the abdominal wall and the hand is passed beneath it
and securely fixed in position; after an interval of 14 to 21 days, when
the flap is assured of its blood supply, the piers of the bridge are
divided (fig. 1). with undermining it is usually easy to bring the
edges of the gap in the abdominal wall together, even in children; the
skin flap on the dorsum of the hand appears rather thick and
prominent--almost like the pad of a boxing-glove--for some time, but
the restoration of function in the capacity to flex the fingers is
gratifying in the extreme.

[illustration: fig. 1.--ulcer of back of hand covered by flap of skin
raised from anterior abdominal wall. the lateral edges of the flap are
divided after the graft has adhered.]

the indirect element of this method of skin-grafting may be carried
still further by transferring the flap of skin first to one part of the
body and then, after it has taken, transferring it to a third part.
gillies has especially developed this method in the remedying of
deformities of the face caused by gunshot wounds and by petrol burns in
air-men. a rectangular flap of skin is marked out in the neck and chest,
the lateral margins of the flap are raised sufficiently to enable them
to be brought together so as to form a tube of skin: after the
circulation has been restored, the lower end of the tube is detached and
is brought up to the lip or cheek, or eyelid, where it is wanted; when
this end has derived its new blood supply, the other end is detached
from the neck and brought up to where it is wanted. in this way, skin
from the chest may be brought up to form a new forehead and eyelids.

grafts of _mucous membrane_ are used to cover defects in the lip, cheek,
and conjunctiva. the technique is similar to that employed in
skin-grafting; the sources of mucous membrane are limited and the
element of septic infection cannot always be excluded.

_fat._--adipose tissue has a low vitality, but it is easily retained and
it readily lends itself to transplantation. portions of fat are often
obtainable at operations--from the omentum, for example, otherwise the
subcutaneous fat of the buttock is the most accessible; it may be
employed to fill up cavities of all kinds in order to obtain more rapid
and sounder healing and also to remedy deformity, as in filling up a
depression in the cheek or forehead. it is ultimately converted into
ordinary connective tissue _pari passu_ with the absorption of the fat.

the _fascia lata of the thigh_ is widely and successfully used as a
graft to fill defects in the dura mater, and interposed between the
bones of a joint--if the articular cartilage has been destroyed--to
prevent the occurrence of ankylosis.

the _peritoneum_ of hydrocele and hernial sacs and of the omentum
readily lends itself to transplantation.

_cartilage and bone_, next to skin, are the tissues most frequently
employed for grafting purposes; their sphere of action is so extensive
and includes so much of technical detail in their employment, that they
will be considered later with the surgery of the bones and joints and
with the methods of re-forming the nose.

_tendons and blood vessels_ readily lend themselves to transplantation
and will also be referred to later.

_muscle and nerve_, on the other hand, do not retain their vitality when
severed from their surroundings and do not functionate as grafts except
for their connective-tissue elements, which it goes without saying are
more readily obtainable from other sources.

portions of the _ovary_ and of the _thyreoid_ have been successfully
transplanted into the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the abdominal wall
by tuffier and others. in these new surroundings, the ovary or thyreoid
is vascularised and has been shown to functionate, but there is not
sufficient regeneration of the essential tissue elements to "carry on";
the secreting tissue is gradually replaced by connective tissue and the
special function comes to an end. even such temporary function may,
however, tide a patient over a difficult period.

conditions which interfere with repair


surgical bacteriology

want of rest--irritation--unhealthy tissues--pathogenic bacteria.
    surgical bacteriology--general characters of
    bacteria--classification of bacteria--conditions of bacterial
    life--pathogenic powers of bacteria--results of bacterial
    growth--death of bacteria--immunity--antitoxic sera--identification
    of bacteria--pyogenic bacteria.

in the management of wounds and other surgical conditions it is
necessary to eliminate various extraneous influences which tend to delay
or arrest the natural process of repair.

of these, one of the most important is undue movement of the affected
part. "the first and great requisite for the restoration of injured
parts is _rest_," said john hunter; and physiological and mechanical
rest as the chief of natural therapeutic agents was the theme of john
hilton's classical work--_rest and pain_. in this connection it must be
understood that "rest" implies more than the mere state of physical
repose: all physiological as well as mechanical function must be
prevented as far as is possible. for instance, the constituent bones of
a joint affected with tuberculosis must be controlled by splints or
other appliances so that no movement can take place between them, and
the limb may not be used for any purpose; physiological rest may be
secured to an inflamed colon by making an artificial anus in the caecum;
the activity of a diseased kidney may be diminished by regulating the
quantity and quality of the fluids taken by the patient.

another source of interference with repair in wounds is _irritation_,
either by mechanical agents such as rough, unsuitable dressings,
bandages, or ill-fitting splints; or by chemical agents in the form of
strong lotions or other applications.

an _unhealthy or devitalised condition of the patient's tissues_ also
hinders the reparative process. bruised or lacerated skin heals less
kindly than skin cut with a smooth, sharp instrument; and persistent

venous congestion of a part, such as occurs, for example, in the leg
when the veins are varicose, by preventing the access of healthy blood,
tends to delay the healing of open wounds. the existence of grave
constitutional disease, such as bright's disease, diabetes, syphilis,
scurvy, or alcoholism, also impedes healing.

infection by disease-producing micro-organisms or _pathogenic bacteria_
is, however, the most potent factor in disturbing the natural process of
repair in wounds.


surgical bacteriology

the influence of micro-organisms in the causation of disease, and the
role played by them in interfering with the natural process of repair,
are so important that the science of applied bacteriology has now come
to dominate every department of surgery, and it is from the standpoint
of bacteriology that nearly all surgical questions have to be
considered.

the term _sepsis_ as now used in clinical surgery no longer retains its
original meaning as synonymous with "putrefaction," but is employed to
denote all conditions in which bacterial infection has taken place, and
more particularly those in which pyogenic bacteria are present. in the
same way the term _aseptic_ conveys the idea of freedom from all forms
of bacteria, putrefactive or otherwise; and the term _antiseptic_ is
used to denote a power of counteracting bacteria and their products.

#general characters of bacteria.#--a _bacterium_ consists of a finely
granular mass of protoplasm, enclosed in a thin gelatinous envelope.
many forms are motile--some in virtue of fine thread-like flagella, and
others through contractility of the protoplasm. the great majority
multiply by simple fission, each parent cell giving rise to two daughter
cells, and this process goes on with extraordinary rapidity. other
varieties, particularly bacilli, are propagated by the formation of
_spores_. a spore is a minute mass of protoplasm surrounded by a dense,
tough membrane, developed in the interior of the parent cell. spores are
remarkable for their tenacity of life, and for the resistance they offer
to the action of heat and chemical germicides.

bacteria are most conveniently classified according to their shape. thus
we recognise (1) those that are globular--_cocci_; (2) those that
resemble a rod--_bacilli_; (3) the spiral or wavy forms--_spirilla_.

_cocci_ or _micrococci_ are minute round bodies, averaging about 1 u in
diameter. the great majority are non-motile. they multiply by fission;
and when they divide in such a way that the resulting cells remain in
pairs, are called _diplococci_, of which the bacteria of gonorrhoea and
pneumonia are examples (fig. 5). when they divide irregularly, and form
grape-like bunches, they are known as _staphylococci_, and to this

variety the commonest pyogenic or pus-forming organisms belong (fig. 2).
when division takes place only in one axis, so that long chains are
formed, the term _streptococcus_ is applied (fig. 3). streptococci are
met with in erysipelas and various other inflammatory and suppurative
processes of a spreading character.

_bacilli_ are rod-shaped bacteria, usually at least twice as long as
they are broad (fig. 4). some multiply by fission, others by
sporulation. some forms are motile, others are non-motile. tuberculosis,
tetanus, anthrax, and many other surgical diseases are due to different
forms of bacilli.

_spirilla_ are long, slender, thread-like cells, more or less spiral or
wavy. some move by a screw-like contraction of the protoplasm, some by
flagellae. the spirochaete associated with syphilis (fig. 36) is the most
important member of this group.

#conditions of bacterial life.#--bacteria require for their growth and
development a suitable food-supply in the form of proteins,
carbohydrates, and salts of calcium and potassium which they break up
into simpler elements. an alkaline medium favours bacterial growth; and
moisture is a necessary condition; spores, however, can survive the want
of water for much longer periods than fully developed bacteria. the
necessity for oxygen varies in different species. those that require
oxygen are known as _aerobic bacilli_ or _aerobes_; those that cannot
live in the presence of oxygen are spoken of as _anaerobes_. the great
majority of bacteria, however, while they prefer to have oxygen, are
able to live without it, and are called _facultative anaerobes_.

the most suitable temperature for bacterial life is from 95 o to 102 o f.,
roughly that of the human body. extreme or prolonged cold paralyses but
does not kill micro-organisms. few, however, survive being raised to a
temperature of 134 1/2 o f. boiling for ten to twenty minutes will kill all
bacteria, and the great majority of spores. steam applied in an
autoclave under a pressure of two atmospheres destroys even the most
resistant spores in a few minutes. direct sunlight, electric light, or
even diffuse daylight, is inimical to the growth of bacteria, as are
also rontgen rays and radium emanations.

#pathogenic properties of bacteria.#--we are now only concerned with
pathogenic bacteria--that is, bacteria capable of producing disease in
the human subject. this capacity depends upon two sets of factors--(1)
certain features peculiar to the invading bacteria, and (2) others
peculiar to the host. many bacteria have only the power of living upon
dead matter, and are known as _saphrophytes_. such as do nourish in
living tissue are, by distinction, known as _parasites_. the power a
given parasitic micro-organism has of multiplying in the body and giving
rise to disease is spoken of as its _virulence_, and this varies not
only with different species, but in the same species at different times
and under varying circumstances. the actual number of organisms
introduced is also an important factor in determining their pathogenic
power. healthy tissues can resist the invasion of a certain number of
bacteria of a given species, but when that number is exceeded, the
organisms get the upper hand and disease results. when the organisms
gain access directly to the blood-stream, as a rule they produce their
effects more certainly and with greater intensity than when they are
introduced into the tissues.

further, the virulence of an organism is modified by the condition of
the patient into whose tissues it is introduced. so long as a person is
in good health, the tissues are able to resist the attacks of moderate
numbers of most bacteria. any lowering of the vitality of the
individual, however, either locally or generally, at once renders him
more susceptible to infection. thus bruised or torn tissue is much more
liable to infection with pus-producing organisms than tissues clean-cut
with a knife; also, after certain diseases, the liability to infection
by the organisms of diphtheria, pneumonia, or erysipelas is much
increased. even such slight depression of vitality as results from
bodily fatigue, or exposure to cold and damp, may be sufficient to turn
the scale in the battle between the tissues and the bacteria. age is an
important factor in regard to the action of certain bacteria. young
subjects are attacked by diphtheria, tuberculosis, acute osteomyelitis,
and some other diseases with greater frequency and severity than those
of more advanced years.

in different races, localities, environment, and seasons, the pathogenic
powers of certain organisms, such as those of erysipelas, diphtheria,
and acute osteomyelitis, vary considerably.

there is evidence that a _mixed infection_--that is, the introduction of
more than one species of organism, for example, the tubercle bacillus
and a pyogenic staphylococcus--increases the severity of the resulting
disease. if one of the varieties gain the ascendancy, the poisons
produced by the others so devitalise the tissue cells, and diminish
their power of resistance, that the virulence of the most active
organisms is increased. on the other hand, there is reason to believe
that the products of certain organisms antagonise one another--for
example, an attack of erysipelas may effect the cure of a patch of
tuberculous lupus.

lastly, in patients suffering from chronic wasting diseases, bacteria
may invade the internal organs by the blood-stream in enormous numbers
and with great rapidity, during the period of extreme debility which
shortly precedes death. the discovery of such collections of organisms
on post-mortem examination may lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn
as to the cause of death.

#results of bacterial growth.#--some organisms, such as those of tetanus
and erysipelas, and certain of the pyogenic bacteria, show little
tendency to pass far beyond the point at which they gain an entrance to
the body. others, on the contrary--for example, the tubercle bacillus
and the organism of acute osteomyelitis--although frequently remaining
localised at the seat of inoculation, tend to pass to distant parts,
lodging in the capillaries of joints, bones, kidney, or lungs, and there
producing their deleterious effects.

in the human subject, multiplication in the blood-stream does not occur
to any great extent. in some general acute pyogenic infections, such as
osteomyelitis, cellulitis, etc., pure cultures of staphylococci or of
streptococci may be obtained from the blood. in pneumococcal and typhoid
infections, also, the organisms may be found in the blood.

it is by the vital changes they bring about in the parts where they
settle that micro-organisms disturb the health of the patient. in
deriving nourishment from the complex organic compounds in which they
nourish, the organisms evolve, probably by means of a ferment, certain
chemical products of unknown composition, but probably colloidal in
nature, and known as _toxins_. when these poisons are absorbed into the
general circulation they give rise to certain groups of symptoms--such
as rise of temperature, associated circulatory and respiratory
derangements, interference with the gastro-intestinal functions and also
with those of the nervous system--which go to make up the condition
known as blood-poisoning, toxaemia, or _bacterial intoxication_. in
addition to this, certain bacteria produce toxins that give rise to
definite and distinct groups of symptoms--such as the convulsions of
tetanus, or the paralyses that follow diphtheria.

_death of bacteria._--under certain circumstances, it would appear that
the accumulation of the toxic products of bacterial action tends to
interfere with the continued life and growth of the organisms
themselves, and in this way the natural cure of certain diseases is
brought about. outside the body, bacteria may be killed by starvation,
by want of moisture, by being subjected to high temperature, or by the
action of certain chemical agents of which carbolic acid, the
perchloride and biniodide of mercury, and various chlorine preparations
are the most powerful.

#immunity.#--some persons are insusceptible to infection by certain
diseases, from which they are said to enjoy a _natural immunity_. in
many acute diseases one attack protects the patient, for a time at
least, from a second attack--_acquired immunity_.

_phagocytosis._--in the production of immunity the leucocytes and
certain other cells play an important part in virtue of the power they
possess of ingesting bacteria and of destroying them by a process of
intra-cellular digestion. to this process metchnikoff gave the name of
_phagocytosis_, and he recognised two forms of _phagocytes_: (1) the
_microphages_, which are the polymorpho-nuclear leucocytes of the blood;
and (2) the _macrophages_, which include the larger hyaline leucocytes,
endothelial cells, and connective-tissue corpuscles.

during the process of phagocytosis, the polymorpho-nuclear leucocytes in
the circulating blood increase greatly in numbers (_leucocytosis_), as
well as in their phagocytic action, and in the course of destroying the
bacteria they produce certain ferments which enter the blood serum.
these are known as _opsonins_ or _alexins_, and they act on the bacteria
by a process comparable to narcotisation, and render them an easy prey
for the phagocytes.

_artificial or passive immunity._--a form of immunity can be induced by
the introduction of protective substances obtained from an animal which
has been actively immunised. the process by which passive immunity is
acquired depends upon the fact that as a result of the reaction between
the specific virus of a particular disease (the _antigen_) and the
tissues of the animal attacked, certain substances--_antibodies_--are
produced, which when transferred to the body of a susceptible animal
protect it against that disease. the most important of these antibodies
are the _antitoxins_. from the study of the processes by which immunity
is secured against the effects of bacterial action the serum and vaccine
methods of treating certain infective diseases have been evolved. the
_serum treatment_ is designed to furnish the patient with a sufficiency
of antibodies to neutralise the infection. the anti-diphtheritic and the
anti-tetanic act by neutralising the specific toxins of the
disease--_antitoxic serums_; the anti-streptcoccic and the serum for
anthrax act upon the bacteria--_anti-bacterial serums_.

a _polyvalent_ serum, that is, one derived from an animal which has been
immunised by numerous strains of the organism derived from various
sources, is much more efficacious than when a single strain has been
used.

_clinical use of serums._--every precaution must be taken to prevent
organismal contamination of the serum or of the apparatus by means of
which it is injected. syringes are so made that they can be sterilised
by boiling. the best situations for injection are under the skin of the
abdomen, the thorax, or the buttock, and the skin should be purified at
the seat of puncture. if the bulk of the full dose is large, it should
be divided and injected into different parts of the body, not more than
20 c.c. being injected at one place. the serum may be introduced
directly into a vein, or into the spinal canal, _e.g._ anti-tetanic
serum. the immunity produced by injections of antitoxic sera lasts only
for a comparatively short time, seldom longer than a few weeks.

_"serum disease" and anaphylaxis._--it is to be borne in mind that some
patients exhibit a supersensitiveness with regard to protective sera, an
injection being followed in a few days by the appearance of an
urticarial or erythematous rash, pain and swelling of the joints, and a
variable degree of fever. these symptoms, to which the name _serum
disease_ is applied, usually disappear in the course of a few days.

the term _anaphylaxis_ is applied to an allied condition of
supersensitiveness which appears to be induced by the injection of
certain substances, including toxins and sera, that are capable of
acting as antigens. when a second injection is given after an interval
of some days, if anaphylaxis has been established by the first dose, the
patient suddenly manifests toxic symptoms of the nature of profound
shock which may even prove fatal. the conditions which render a person
liable to develop anaphylaxis and the mechanism by which it is
established are as yet imperfectly understood.

_vaccine treatment._--the vaccine treatment elaborated by a. e. wright
consists in injecting, while the disease is still active, specially
prepared dead cultures of the causative organisms, and is based on the
fact that these "vaccines" render the bacteria in the tissues less able
to resist the attacks of the phagocytes. the method is most successful
when the vaccine is prepared from organisms isolated from the patient
himself, _autogenous vaccine_, but when this is impracticable, or takes
a considerable time, laboratory-prepared polyvalent _stock vaccines_ may
be used.

_clinical use of vaccines._--vaccines should not be given while a
patient is in a negative phase, as a certain amount of the opsonin in
the blood is used up in neutralising the substances injected, and this
may reduce the opsonic index to such an extent that the vaccines
themselves become dangerous. as a rule, the propriety of using a vaccine
can be determined from the general condition of the patient. the initial
dose should always be a small one, particularly if the disease is acute,
and the subsequent dosage will be regulated by the effect produced. if
marked constitutional disturbance with rise of temperature follows the
use of a vaccine, it indicates a negative phase, and calls for a
diminution in the next dose. if, on the other hand, the local as well as
the general condition of the patient improves after the injection, it
indicates a positive phase, and the original dose may be repeated or
even increased. vaccines are best introduced subcutaneously, a part
being selected which is not liable to pressure, as there is sometimes
considerable local reaction. repeated doses may be necessary at
intervals of a few days.

the vaccine treatment has been successfully employed in various
tuberculous lesions, in pyogenic infections such as acne, boils,
sycosis, streptococcal, pneumococcal, and gonococcal conditions, in
infections of the accessory air sinuses, and in other diseases caused by
bacteria.


pyogenic bacteria

from the point of view of the surgeon the most important varieties of
micro-organisms are those that cause inflammation and suppuration--the
_pyogenic bacteria_. this group includes a great many species, and these
are so widely distributed that they are to be met with under all
conditions of everyday life.

the nature of the inflammatory and suppurative processes will be
considered in detail later; suffice it here to say that they are brought
about by the action of one or other of the organisms that we have now to
consider.

it is found that the _staphylococci_, which cluster into groups, tend to
produce localised lesions; while the chain-forms--_streptococci_--give
rise to diffuse, spreading conditions. many varieties of pyogenic
bacteria have now been differentiated, the best known being the
staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus, and the bacillus coli
communis.

[illustration: fig. 2.--staphylococcus aureus in pus from case of
osteomyelitis. x 1000 diam. gram's stain.]

_staphylococcus aureus._--this is the commonest organism found in
localised inflammatory and suppurative conditions. it varies greatly in
its virulence, and is found in such widely different conditions as skin
pustules, boils, carbuncles, and some acute inflammations of bone. as
seen by the microscope it occurs in grape-like clusters, fission of the
individual cells taking place irregularly (fig. 2). when grown in
artificial media, the colonies assume an orange-yellow colour--hence the
name _aureus_. it is of high vitality and resists more prolonged
exposure to high temperatures than most non-sporing bacteria. it is
capable of lying latent in the tissues for long periods, for example, in
the marrow of long bones, and of again becoming active and causing a
fresh outbreak of suppuration. this organism is widely distributed: it
is found on the skin, in the mouth, and in other situations in the body,
and as it is present in the dust of the air and on all objects upon
which dust has settled, it is a continual source of infection unless
means are taken to exclude it from wounds.

the _staphylococcus albus_ is much less common than the aureus, but has
the same properties and characters, save that its growth on artificial
media assumes a white colour. it is the common cause of stitch
abscesses, the skin being its normal habitat.

[illustration: fig. 3.--streptococci in pus from an acute abscess in
subcutaneous tissue. x 1000 diam. gram's stain.]

_streptococcus pyogenes._--this organism also varies greatly in its
virulence; in some instances--for example in erysipelas--it causes a
sharp attack of acute spreading inflammation, which soon subsides
without showing any tendency to end in suppuration; under other
conditions it gives rise to a generalised infection which rapidly proves
fatal. the streptococcus has less capacity of liquefying the tissues
than the staphylococcus, so that pus formation takes place more slowly.
at the same time its products are very potent in destroying the tissues
in their vicinity, and so interfering with the exudation of leucocytes
which would otherwise exercise their protective influence. streptococci
invade the lymph spaces, and are associated with acute spreading
conditions such as phlegmonous or erysipelatous inflammations and
suppurations, lymphangitis and suppuration in lymph glands, and
inflammation of serous and synovial membranes, also with a form of
pneumonia which is prone to follow on severe operations in the mouth and
throat. streptococci are also concerned in the production of spreading
gangrene and pyaemia.

division takes place in one axis, so that chains of varying length are
formed (fig. 3). it is less easily cultivated by artificial media than
the staphylococcus; it forms a whitish growth.

[illustration: fig. 4.--bacillus coli communis in urine, from a case of
cystitis. x 1000 diam. leishman's stain.]

_bacillus coli communis._--this organism, which is a normal inhabitant
of the intestinal tract, shows a great tendency to invade any organ or
tissue whose vitality is lowered. it is causatively associated with such
conditions as peritonitis and peritoneal suppuration resulting from
strangulated hernia, appendicitis, or perforation in any part of the
alimentary canal. in cystitis, pyelitis, abscess of the kidney,
suppuration in the bile-ducts or liver, and in many other abdominal
conditions, it plays a most important part. the discharge from wounds
infected by this organism has usually a foetid, or even a faecal odour,
and often contains gases resulting from putrefaction.

it is a small rod-shaped organism with short flagellae, which render it
motile (fig. 4). it closely resembles the typhoid bacillus, but is
distinguished from it by its behaviour in artificial culture media.

[illustration: fig. 5.--fraenkel's pneumococci in pus from empyema
following pneumonia. x 100 diam. stained with muir's capsule stain.]

_pneumo-bacteria._--two forms of organism associated with
pneumonia--_fraenkel's pneumococcus_ (one of the diplococci) (fig. 5)
and _friedlander's pneumo-bacillus_ (a short rod-shaped form)--are
frequently met with in inflammations of the serous and synovial
membranes, in suppuration in the liver, and in various other
inflammatory and suppurative conditions.

_bacillus typhosus._--this organism has been found in pure culture in
suppurative conditions of bone, of cellular tissue, and of internal
organs, especially during convalescence from typhoid fever. like the
staphylococcus, it is capable of lying latent in the tissues for long
periods.

_other pyogenic bacteria._--it is not necessary to do more than name
some of the other organisms that are known to be pyogenic, such as the
bacillus pyocyaneus, which is found in green and blue pus, the
micrococcus tetragenus, the gonococcus, actinomyces, the glanders
bacillus, and the tubercle bacillus. most of these will receive further
mention in connection with the diseases to which they give rise.

#leucocytosis.#--most bacterial diseases, as well as certain other
pathological conditions, are associated with an increase in the number
of leucocytes in the blood throughout the circulatory system. this
condition of the blood, which is known as _leucocytosis_, is believed to
be due to an excessive output and rapid formation of leucocytes by the
bone marrow, and it probably has as its object the arrest and
destruction of the invading organisms or toxins. to increase the
resisting power of the system to pathogenic organisms, an artificial
leucocytosis may be induced by subcutaneous injection of a solution of
nucleinate of soda (16 minims of a 5 per cent. solution).

the _normal_ number of leucocytes per cubic millimetre varies in
different individuals, and in the same individual under different
conditions, from 5000 to 10,000: 7500 is a normal average, and anything
above 12,000 is considered abnormal. when leucocytosis is present, the
number may range from 12,000 to 30,000 or even higher; 40,000 is looked
upon as a high degree of leucocytosis. according to ehrlich, the
following may be taken as the standard proportion of the various forms
of leucocytes in normal blood: polynuclear neutrophile leucocytes, 70 to
72 per cent.; lymphocytes, 22 to 25 per cent.; eosinophile cells, 2 to 4
per cent.; large mononuclear and transitional leucocytes, 2 to 4 per
cent.; mast-cells, 0.5 to 2 per cent.

in estimating the clinical importance of a leucocytosis, it is not
sufficient merely to count the aggregate number of leucocytes present. a
differential count must be made to determine which variety of cells is
in excess. in the majority of surgical affections it is chiefly the
granular polymorpho-nuclear neutrophile leucocytes that are in excess
(_ordinary leucocytosis_). in some cases, and particularly in parasitic
diseases such as trichiniasis and hydatid disease, the eosinophile
leucocytes also show a proportionate increase (_eosinophilia_). the term
_lymphocytosis_ is applied when there is an increase in the number of
circulating lymphocytes, as occurs, for example, in lymphatic leucaemia,
and in certain cases of syphilis.

leucocytosis is met with in nearly all acute infective diseases, and in
acute pyogenic inflammatory affections, particularly in those attended
with suppuration. in exceptionally acute septic conditions the extreme
virulence of the toxins may prevent the leucocytes reacting, and
leucocytosis may be absent. the absence of leucocytosis in a disease in
which it is usually present is therefore to be looked upon as a grave
omen, particularly when the general symptoms are severe. in some cases
of malignant disease the number of leucocytes is increased to 15,000 or
20,000. a few hours after a severe haemorrhage also there is usually a
leucocytosis of from 15,000 to 30,000, which lasts for three or four
days (lyon). in cases of haemorrhage the leucocytosis is increased by
infusion of fluids into the circulation. after all operations there is
at least a transient leucocytosis (_post-operative leucocytosis_)
(f. i. dawson).

the leucocytosis begins soon after the infection manifests itself--for
example, by shivering, rigor, or rise of temperature. the number of
leucocytes rises somewhat rapidly, increases while the condition is
progressing, and remains high during the febrile period, but there is no
constant correspondence between the number of leucocytes and the height
of the temperature. the arrest of the inflammation and its resolution
are accompanied by a fall in the number of leucocytes, while the
occurrence of suppuration is attended with a further increase in their
number.

in interpreting the "blood count," it is to be kept in mind that a
_physiological leucocytosis_ occurs within three or four hours of taking
a meal, especially one rich in proteins, from 1500 to 2000 being added
to the normal number. in this _digestion leucocytosis_ the increase is
chiefly in the polynuclear neutrophile leucocytes. immediately before
and after delivery, particularly in primiparae, there is usually a
moderate degree of leucocytosis. if the labour is normal and the
puerperium uncomplicated, the number of leucocytes regains the normal in
about a week. lactation has no appreciable effect on the number of
leucocytes. in new-born infants the leucocyte count is abnormally high,
ranging from 15,000 to 20,000. in children under one year of age, the
normal average is from 10,000 to 20,000.

_absence of leucocytosis--leucopenia._--in certain infective diseases
the number of leucocytes in the circulating blood is abnormally
low--3000 or 4000--and this condition is known as _leucopenia_. it
occurs in typhoid fever, especially in the later stages of the disease,
in tuberculous lesions unaccompanied by suppuration, in malaria, and in
most cases of uncomplicated influenza. the occurrence of leucocytosis in
any of these conditions is to be looked upon as an indication that a
mixed infection has taken place, and that some suppurative process is
present.

the absence of leucocytosis in some cases of virulent septic poisoning
has already been referred to.

it will be evident that too much reliance must not be placed upon a
single observation, particularly in emergency cases. whenever possible,
a series of observations should be made, the blood being examined about
four hours after meals, and about the same hour each day.

the clinical significance of the blood count in individual diseases will
be further referred to.

_the iodine or glycogen reaction._--the leucocyte count may be
supplemented by staining films of the blood with a watery solution of
iodine and potassium iodide. in all advancing purulent conditions, in
septic poisonings, in pneumonia, and in cancerous growths associated
with ulceration, a certain number of the polynuclear leucocytes are
stained a brown or reddish-brown colour, due to the action of the iodine
on some substance in the cells of the nature of glycogen. this reaction
is absent in serous effusions, in unmixed tuberculous infections, in
uncomplicated typhoid fever, and in the early stages of cancerous
growths.




chapter iii

inflammation


definition--nature of inflammation from surgical point of
    view--sequence of changes in bacterial inflammation--clinical
    aspects of inflammation--general principles of treatment--chronic
    inflammation.

inflammation may be defined as the series of vital changes that occurs
in the tissues in response to irritation. these changes represent the
reaction of the tissue elements to the irritant, and constitute the
attempt made by nature to arrest or to limit its injurious effects, and
to repair the damage done by it.

the phenomena which characterise the inflammatory reaction can be
induced by any form of irritation--such, for example, as mechanical
injury, the application of heat or of chemical substances, or the action
of pathogenic bacteria and their toxins--and they are essentially
similar in kind whatever the irritant may be. the extent to which the
process may go, however, and its effects on the part implicated and on
the system as a whole, vary with different irritants and with the
intensity and duration of their action. a mechanical, a thermal, or a
chemical irritant, acting alone, induces a degree of reaction directly
proportionate to its physical properties, and so long as it does not
completely destroy the vitality of the part involved, the changes in the
tissues are chiefly directed towards repairing the damage done to the
part, and the inflammatory reaction is not only compatible with the
occurrence of ideal repair, but may be looked upon as an integral step
in the reparative process.

the irritation caused by infection with bacteria, on the other hand, is
cumulative, as the organisms not only multiply in the tissues, but in
addition produce chemical poisons (toxins) which aggravate the
irritative effects. the resulting reaction is correspondingly
progressive, and has as its primary object the expulsion of the irritant
and the limitation of its action. if the natural protective effort is
successful, the resulting tissue changes subserve the process of repair,
but if the bacteria gain the upper hand in the struggle, the
inflammatory reaction becomes more intense, certain of the tissue
elements succumb, and the process for the time being is a destructive
one. during the stage of bacterial inflammation, reparative processes
are in abeyance, and it is only after the inflammation has been allayed,
either by natural means or by the aid of the surgeon, that repair takes
place.

in applying the antiseptic principle to the treatment of wounds, our
main object is to exclude or to eliminate the bacterial factor, and so
to prevent the inflammatory reaction going beyond the stage in which it
is protective, and just in proportion as we succeed in attaining this
object, do we favour the occurrence of ideal repair.

#sequence of changes in bacterial inflammation.#--as the form of
inflammation with which we are most concerned is that due to the action
of bacteria, in describing the process by which the protective influence
of the inflammatory reaction is brought into play, we shall assume the
presence of a bacterial irritant.

the introduction of a colony of micro-organisms is quickly followed by
an accumulation of wandering cells, and proliferation of
connective-tissue cells in the tissues at the site of infection. the
various cells are attracted to the bacteria by a peculiar chemical or
biological power known as _chemotaxis_, which seems to result from
variations in the surface tension of different varieties of cells,
probably caused by some substance produced by the micro-organisms.
changes in the blood vessels then ensue, the arteries becoming dilated
and the rate of the current in them being for a time increased--_active
hyperaemia_. soon, however, the rate of the blood flow becomes slower
than normal, and in course of time the current may cease (_stasis_), and
the blood in the vessels may even coagulate (_thrombosis_). coincidently
with these changes in the vessels, the leucocytes in the blood of the
inflamed part rapidly increase in number, and they become viscous and
adhere to the vessel wall, where they may accumulate in large numbers.
in course of time the leucocytes pass through the vessel
wall--_emigration of leucocytes_--and move towards the seat of
infection, giving rise to a marked degree of _local leucocytosis_.
through the openings by which the leucocytes have escaped from the
vessels, red corpuscles may be passively extruded--_diapedesis of red
corpuscles_. these processes are accompanied by changes in the
endothelium of the vessel walls, which result in an increased formation
of lymph, which transudes into the meshes of the connective tissue
giving rise to an _inflammatory oedema_, or, if the inflammation is on a
free surface, forming an _inflammatory exudate_. the quantity and
characters of this exudate vary in different parts of the body, and
according to the nature, virulence, and location of the organisms
causing the inflammation. thus it may be _serous_, as in some forms of
synovitis; _sero-fibrinous_, as in certain varieties of peritonitis, the
fibrin tending to limit the spread of the inflammation by forming
adhesions; _croupous_, when it coagulates on a free surface and forms a
false membrane, as in diphtheria; _haemorrhagic_ when mixed with blood;
or _purulent_, when suppuration has occurred. the protective effects of
the inflammatory reaction depend for the most part upon the transudation
of lymph and the emigration of leucocytes. the lymph contains the
opsonins which act on the bacteria and render them less able to resist
the attack of the phagocytes, as well as the various protective
antibodies which neutralise the toxins. the polymorph leucocytes are the
principal agents in the process of phagocytosis (p. 22), and together
with the other forms of phagocytes they ingest and destroy the bacteria.

if the attempt to repel the invading organisms is successful, the
irritant effects are overcome, the inflammation is arrested, and
_resolution_ is said to take place.

certain of the vascular and cellular changes are now utilised to restore
the condition to the normal, and _repair_ ensues after the manner
already described. in certain situations, notably in tendon sheaths, in
the cavities of joints, and in the interior of serous cavities, for
example the pleura and peritoneum, the restoration to the normal is not
perfect, adhesions forming between the opposing surfaces.

if, however, the reaction induced by the infection is insufficient to
check the growth and spread of the organisms, or to inhibit their toxin
production, local necrosis of tissue may take place, either in the form
of suppuration or of gangrene, or the toxins absorbed into the
circulation may produce blood-poisoning, which may even prove fatal.

#clinical aspects of inflammation.#--it must clearly be understood that
inflammation is not to be looked upon as a disease in itself, but rather
as an evidence of some infective process going on in the tissues in
which it occurs, and of an effort on the part of these tissues to
overcome the invading organisms and their products. the chief danger to
the patient lies, not in the reactive changes that constitute the
inflammatory process, but in the fact that he is liable to be poisoned
by the toxins of the bacteria at work in the inflamed area.

since the days of celsus (first century a.d.), heat, redness, swelling,
and pain have been recognised as cardinal signs of inflammation, and to
these may be added, interference with function in the inflamed part, and
general constitutional disturbance. variations in these signs and
symptoms depend upon the acuteness of the condition, the nature of the
causative organism and of the tissue attacked, the situation of the part
in relation to the surface, and other factors.

the _heat_ of the inflamed part is to be attributed to the increased
quantity of blood present in it, and the more superficial the affected
area the more readily is the local increase of temperature detected by
the hand. this clinical point is best tested by placing the palm of the
hand and fingers for a few seconds alternately over an uninflamed and an
inflamed area, otherwise under similar conditions as to coverings and
exposure. in this way even slight differences may be recognised.

_redness_, similarly, is due to the increased afflux of blood to the
inflamed part. the shade of colour varies with the stage of the
inflammation, being lighter and brighter in the early, hyperaemic stages,
and darker and duskier when the blood flow is slowed or when stasis has
occurred and the oxygenation of the blood is defective. in the
thrombotic stage the part may assume a purplish hue.

the _swelling_ is partly due to the increased amount of blood in the
affected part and to the accumulation of leucocytes and proliferated
tissue cells, but chiefly to the exudate in the connective
tissue--_inflammatory oedema_. the more open the structure of the tissue
of the part, the greater is the amount of swelling--witness the marked
degree of oedema that occurs in such parts as the scrotum or the eyelids.

_pain_ is a symptom seldom absent in inflammation. _tenderness_--that
is, pain elicited on pressure--is one of the most valuable diagnostic
signs we possess, and is often present before pain is experienced by the
patient. that the area of tenderness corresponds to the area of
inflammation is almost an axiom of surgery. pain and tenderness are due
to the irritation of nerve filaments of the part, rendered all the more
sensitive by the abnormal conditions of their blood supply. in
inflammatory conditions of internal organs, for example the abdominal
viscera, the pain is frequently referred to other parts, usually to an
area supplied by branches from the same segment of the cord as that
supplying the inflamed part.

for purposes of diagnosis, attention should be paid to the terms in
which the patient describes his pain. for example, the pain caused by
an inflammation of the skin is usually described as of a _burning_ or
_itching_ character; that of inflammation in dense tissues like
periosteum or bone, or in encapsuled organs, as _dull_, _boring_, or
_aching_. when inflammation is passing on to suppuration the pain
assumes a _throbbing_ character, and as the pus reaches the surface, or
"points," as it is called, sharp, _darting_, or _lancinating_ pains are
experienced. inflammation involving a nerve-trunk may cause a _boring_
or a _tingling_ pain; while the implication of a serous membrane such as
the pleura or peritoneum gives rise to a pain of a sharp, _stabbing_
character.

_interference with the function_ of the inflamed part is always present
to a greater or less extent.

#constitutional disturbances.#--under the term constitutional
disturbances are included the presence of fever or elevation of
temperature; certain changes in the pulse rate and the respiration;
gastro-intestinal and urinary disturbances; and derangements of the
central nervous system. these are all due to the absorption of toxins
into the general circulation.

_temperature._--a marked rise of temperature is one of the most constant
and important concomitants of acute inflammatory conditions, and the
temperature chart forms a fairly reliable index of the state of the
patient. the toxins interfere with the nerve-centres in the medulla that
regulate the balance between the production and the loss of body heat.

clinically the temperature is estimated by means of a self-registering
thermometer placed, for from one to five minutes, in close contact with
the skin in the axilla, or in the mouth. sometimes the thermometer is
inserted into the rectum, where, however, the temperature is normally
3/4 o f. higher than in the axilla.

_in health_ the temperature of the body is maintained at a mean of about
98.4 o f. (37 o c.) by the heat-regulating mechanism. it varies from hour
to hour even in health, reaching its maximum between four and eight in
the evening, when it may rise to 99 o f., and is at its lowest between
four and six in the morning, when it may be about 97 o f.

the temperature is more easily disturbed in children than in adults, and
may become markedly elevated (104 o or 105 o f.) from comparatively slight
causes; in the aged it is less liable to change, so that a rise to 103 o
or 104 o f. is to be looked upon as indicating a high state of fever.

a sudden rise of temperature is usually associated with a feeling of
chilliness down the back and in the limbs, which may be so marked that
the patient shivers violently, while the skin becomes cold, pale, and
shrivelled--_cutis anserina_. this is a nervous reaction due to a want
of correspondence between the internal and the surface temperature of
the body, and is known clinically as a _rigor_. when the temperature
rises gradually the chill is usually slight and may be unobserved. even
during the cold stage, however, the internal temperature is already
raised, and by the time the chill has passed off its maximum has been
reached.

the _pulse_ is always increased in frequency, and usually varies
directly with the height of the temperature. _respiration_ is more
active during the progress of an inflammation; and bronchial catarrh is
common apart from any antecedent respiratory disease.

_gastro-intestinal disturbances_ take the form of loss of appetite,
vomiting, diminished secretion of the alimentary juices, and weakening
of the peristalsis of the bowel, leading to thirst, dry, furred tongue,
and constipation. diarrhoea is sometimes present. the _urine_ is usually
scanty, of high specific gravity, rich in nitrogenous substances,
especially urea and uric acid, and in calcium salts, while sodium
chloride is deficient. albumin and hyaline casts may be present in cases
of severe inflammation with high temperature. the significance of
general _leucocytosis_ has already been referred to.

#general principles of treatment.#--the capacity of the inflammatory
reaction for dealing with bacterial infections being limited, it often
becomes necessary for the surgeon to aid the natural defensive
processes, as well as to counteract the local and general effects of the
reaction, and to relieve symptoms.

the ideal means of helping the tissues is by removing the focus of
infection, and when this can be done, as for example in a carbuncle or
an anthrax pustule, the infected area may be completely excised. when
the focus is not sufficiently limited to admit of this, the infected
tissue may be scraped away with the sharp spoon, or destroyed by
caustics or by the actual cautery. if this is inadvisable, the organisms
may be attacked by strong antiseptics, such as pure carbolic acid.

moist dressings favour the removal of bacteria by promoting the escape
of the inflammatory exudate, in which they are washed out.

#artificial hyperaemia.#--when such direct means as the above are
impracticable, much can be done to aid the tissues in their struggle by
improving the condition of the circulation in the inflamed area, so as
to ensure that a plentiful supply of fresh arterial blood reaches it.
the beneficial effects of _hot fomentations and poultices_ depend on
their causing a dilatation of the vessels, and so inducing a hyperaemia
in the affected area. it has been shown experimentally that repeated,
short applications of moist heat (not exceeding 106 o f.) are more
efficacious than continuous application. it is now believed that the
so-called _counter-irritants_--mustard, iodine, cantharides, actual
cautery--act in the same way; and the method of treating erysipelas by
applying a strong solution of iodine around the affected area is based
on the same principle.

[illustration: fig. 6.--passive hyperaemia of hand and forearm induced by
bier's bandage.]

while these and similar methods have long been employed in the treatment
of inflammatory conditions, it is only within comparatively recent years
that their mode of action has been properly understood, and to august
bier belongs the credit of having put the treatment of inflammation on a
scientific and rational basis. recognising the "beneficent intention" of
the inflammatory reaction, and the protective action of the leucocytosis
which accompanies the hyperaemic stages of the process, bier was led to
study the effects of increasing the hyperaemia by artificial means. as a
result of his observations, he has formulated a method of treatment
which consists in inducing an artificial hyperaemia in the inflamed area,
either by obstructing the venous return from the part (_passive
hyperaemia_), or by stimulating the arterial flow through it (_active
hyperaemia_).

_bier's constricting bandage._--to induce a _passive hyperaemia_ in a
limb, an elastic bandage is applied some distance above the inflamed
area sufficiently tightly to obstruct the venous return from the distal
parts without arresting in any way the inflow of arterial blood (fig. 6).
if the constricting band is correctly applied, the parts beyond
become swollen and oedematous, and assume a bluish-red hue, but they
retain their normal temperature, the pulse is unchanged, and there is no
pain. if the part becomes blue, cold, or painful, or if any existing
pain is increased, the band has been applied too tightly. the hyperaemia
is kept up from twenty to twenty-two hours out of the twenty-four, and
in the intervals the limb is elevated to get rid of the oedema and to
empty it of impure blood, and so make room for a fresh supply of healthy
blood when the bandage is re-applied. as the inflammation subsides, the
period during which the band is kept on each day is diminished; but the
treatment should be continued for some days after all signs of
inflammation have subsided.

this method of treating acute inflammatory conditions necessitates
close supervision until the correct degree of tightness of the band has
been determined.

[illustration: fig. 7.--passive hyperaemia of finger induced by klapp's
suction bell.]

_klapp's suction bells._--in inflammatory conditions to which the
constricting band cannot be applied, as for example an acute mastitis, a
bubo in the groin, or a boil on the neck, the affected area may be
rendered hyperaemic by an appropriately shaped glass bell applied over it
and exhausted by means of a suction-pump, the rarefaction of the air in
the bell determining a flow of blood into the tissues enclosed within it
(figs. 7 and 8). the edge of the bell is smeared with vaseline, and the
suction applied for from five to ten minutes at a time, with a
corresponding interval between the applications. each sitting lasts for
from half an hour to an hour, and the treatment may be carried out once
or twice a day according to circumstances. this apparatus acts in the
same way as the old-fashioned _dry cup_, and is more convenient and
equally efficacious.

[illustration: fig. 8.--passive hyperaemia induced by klapp's suction
bell for inflammation of inguinal gland.]

_active hyperaemia_ is induced by the local application of heat,
particularly by means of hot air. it has not proved so useful in acute
inflammation as passive hyperaemia, but is of great value in hastening
the absorption of inflammatory products and in overcoming adhesions and
stiffness in tendons and joints.

_general treatment._--the patient should be kept at rest, preferably in
bed, to diminish the general tissue waste; and the diet should be
restricted to fluids, such as milk, beef-tea, meat juices or gruel, and
these may be rendered more easily assimilable by artificial digestion if
necessary. to counteract the general effect of toxins absorbed into
the circulation, specific antitoxic sera are employed in certain forms
of infection, such as diphtheria, streptococcal septicaemia, and tetanus.
in other forms of infection, vaccines are employed to increase the
opsonic power of the blood. when such means are not available, the
circulating toxins may to some extent be diluted by giving plenty of
bland fluids by the mouth or normal salt solution by the rectum.

the elimination of the toxins is promoted by securing free action of the
emunctories. a saline purge, such as half an ounce of sulphate of
magnesium in a small quantity of water, ensures a free evacuation of the
bowels. the kidneys are flushed by such diluent drinks as equal parts of
milk and lime water, or milk with a dram of liquor calcis saccharatus
added to each tumblerful. barley-water and "imperial drink," which
consists of a dram and a half of cream of tartar added to a pint of
boiling water and sweetened with sugar after cooling, are also useful
and non-irritating diuretics. the skin may be stimulated by dover's
powder (10 grains) or liquor ammoniae acetatis in three-dram doses every
four hours.

various drugs administered internally, such as quinine, salol,
salicylate of iron, and others, have a reputation, more or less
deserved, as internal antiseptics.

weakness of the heart, as indicated by the condition of the pulse, is
treated by the use of such drugs as digitalis, strophanthus, or
strychnin, according to circumstances.

gastro-intestinal disturbances are met by ordinary medical means.
vomiting, for example, can sometimes be checked by effervescing drinks,
such as citrate of caffein, or by dilute hydrocyanic acid and bismuth.
in severe cases, and especially when the vomited matter resembles
coffee-grounds from admixture with altered blood--the so-called
post-operative haematemesis--the best means of arresting the vomiting is
by washing out the stomach. thirst is relieved by rectal injections of
saline solution. the introduction of saline solution into the veins or
by the rectum is also useful in diluting and hastening the elimination
of circulating toxins.

in surgical inflammations, as a rule, nothing is gained by lowering the
temperature, unless at the same time the cause is removed. when severe
or prolonged pyrexia becomes a source of danger, the use of hot or cold
sponging, or even the cold bath, is preferable to the administration of
drugs.

_relief of symptoms._--for the relief of _pain_, rest is essential. the
inflamed part should be placed in a splint or other appliance which will
prevent movement, and steps must be taken to reduce its functional
activity as far as possible. locally, warm and moist dressings, such as
a poultice or fomentation, may be used. to make a fomentation, a piece
of flannel or lint is wrung out of very hot water or antiseptic lotion
and applied under a sheet of mackintosh. fomentations should be renewed
as often as they cool. an ordinary india-rubber bag filled with hot
water and fixed over the fomentation, by retaining the heat, obviates
the necessity of frequently changing the application. the addition of a
few drops of laudanum sprinkled on the flannel has a soothing effect.
lead and opium lotion is a useful, soothing application employed as a
fomentation. we prefer the application of lint soaked in a 10 per cent.
aqueous or glycerine solution of ichthyol, or smeared with ichthyol
ointment (1 in 3). belladonna and glycerine, equal parts, may be used.

dry cold obtained by means of icebags, or by leiter's lead tubes through
which a continuous stream of ice-cold water is kept flowing, is
sometimes soothing to the patient, but when the vessels in the inflamed
part are greatly congested its use is attended with considerable risk,
as it not only contracts the arterioles supplying the part, but also
diminishes the outflow of venous blood, and so may determine gangrene of
tissues already devitalised.

a milder form of employing cold is by means of evaporating lotions: a
thin piece of lint or gauze is applied over the inflamed part and kept
constantly moist with the lotion, the dressing being left freely exposed
to allow of continuous evaporation. a useful evaporating lotion is made
up as follows: take of chloride of ammonium, half an ounce; rectified
spirit, one ounce; and water, seven ounces.

the administration of opiates may be necessary for the relief of pain.

the accumulation of an excessive amount of inflammatory exudate may
endanger the vitality of the tissues by pressing on the blood vessels to
such an extent as to cause stasis, and by concentrating the local action
of the toxins. under such conditions the tension should be relieved and
the exudate with its contained toxins removed by making an incision into
the inflamed tissues, and applying a suction bell. when the exudate has
collected in a synovial cavity, such as a joint or bursa, it may be
withdrawn by means of a trocar and cannula. there are other methods of
withdrawing blood and exudate from an inflamed area, for example by
leeches or wet-cupping, but they are seldom employed now.

before applying leeches the part must be thoroughly cleansed, and if
the leech is slow to bite, may be smeared with cream. the leech is
retained in position under an inverted wine-glass or wide test-tube till
it takes hold. after it has sucked its fill it usually drops off, having
withdrawn a dram or a dram and a half of blood. if it be desirable to
withdraw more blood, hot fomentations should be applied to the bite. as
it is sometimes necessary to employ considerable pressure to stop the
bleeding, leeches should, if possible, be applied over a bone which will
furnish the necessary resistance. the use of styptics may be called for.

_wet-cupping_ has almost entirely been superseded by the use of klapp's
suction bells.

_general blood-letting_ consists in opening a superficial vein
(venesection) and allowing from eight to ten ounces of blood to flow
from it. it is seldom used in the treatment of surgical forms of
inflammation.

_counter-irritants._--in deep-seated inflammations, counter-irritants
are sometimes employed in the form of mustard leaves or blisters,
according to the degree of irritation required. a mustard leaf or
plaster should not be left on longer than ten or fifteen minutes, unless
it is desired to produce a blister. blistering may be produced by a
_cantharides plaster_, or by painting with _liquor epispasticus_. the
plaster should be left on from eight to ten hours, and if it has failed
to raise a blister, a hot fomentation should be applied to the part.
_liquor epispasticus_, alone or mixed with equal parts of collodion, is
painted on the part with a brush. several paintings are often required
before a blister is raised. the preliminary removal of the natural
grease from the skin favours the action of these applications.

the treatment of inflammation in special tissues and organs will be
considered in the sections devoted to regional surgery.

#chronic inflammation.#--a variety of types of chronic and subacute
inflammation are met with which, owing to ignorance of their causations,
cannot at present be satisfactorily classified.

the best defined group is that of the _granulomata_, which includes such
important diseases as tuberculosis and syphilis, and in which different
types of chronic inflammation are caused by infection with a specific
organism, all having the common character, however, that abundant
granulation tissue is formed in which cellular changes are more in
evidence than changes in the blood vessels, and in which the subsequent
degeneration and necrosis of the granulation tissue results in the
breaking down and destruction of the tissue in which it is formed.
another group is that in which chronic inflammation is due to mild or
attenuated forms of pyogenic infection affecting especially the lymph
glands and the bone marrow. in the glands of the groin, for example,
associated with various forms of irritation about the external genitals,
different types of _chronic lymphadenitis_ are met with; they do not
frankly suppurate as do the acute types, but are attended with a
hyperplasia of the tissue elements which results in enlargement of the
affected glands of a persistent, and sometimes of a relapsing character.
similar varieties of _osteomyelitis_ are met with that do not, like the
acute forms, go on to suppuration or to death of bone, but result in
thickening of the bone affected, both on the surface and in the
interior, resulting in obliteration of the medullary canal.

a third group of chronic inflammations are those that begin as an acute
pyogenic inflammation, which, instead of resolving completely, persists
in a chronic form. it does so apparently because there is some factor
aiding the organisms and handicapping the tissues, such as the presence
of a foreign body, a piece of glass or metal, or a piece of dead bone;
in these circumstances the inflammation persists in a chronic form,
attended with the formation of fibrous tissue, and, in the case of bone,
with the formation of new bone in excess. it will be evident that in
this group, chronic inflammation and repair are practically
interchangeable terms.

there are other groups of chronic inflammation, the origin of which
continues to be the subject of controversy. reference is here made to
the chronic inflammations of the synovial membrane of joints, of tendon
sheaths and of bursae--_chronic synovitis_, _teno-synovitis_ and
_bursitis_; of the fibrous tissues of joints--chronic forms of
_arthritis_; of the blood vessels--chronic forms of _endarteritis_ and
of _phlebitis_ and of the peripheral nerves--_neuritis_. also in the
breast and in the prostate, with the waning of sexual life there may
occur a formation of fibrous tissue--chronic _interstitial mastitis_,
_chronic prostatitis_, having analogies with the chronic interstitial
inflammations of internal organs like the kidney--_chronic interstitial
nephritis_; and in the breast and prostate, as in the kidney, the
formation of fibrous tissue leads to changes in the secreting epithelium
resulting in the formation of cysts.

lastly, there are still other types of chronic inflammation attended
with the formation of fibrous tissue on such a liberal scale as to
suggest analogies with new growths. the best known of these are the
systematic forms of fibromatosis met with in the central nervous system
and in the peripheral nerves--_neuro-fibromatosis_; in the submucous
coat of the stomach--_gastric fibromatosis_; and in the
colon--_intestinal fibromatosis_.

these conditions will be described with the tissues and organs in which
they occur.

in the _treatment of chronic inflammations_, pending further knowledge
as to their causation, and beyond such obvious indications as to help
the tissues by removing a foreign body or a piece of dead bone, there
are employed--empirically--a number of procedures such as the induction
of hyperaemia, exposure to the x-rays, and the employment of blisters,
cauteries, and setons. vaccines may be had recourse to in those of
bacterial origin.




chapter iv

suppuration


definition--pus--_varieties_--acute circumscribed abscess--_acute
    suppuration in a wound_--_acute suppuration in a mucous
    membrane_--diffuse cellulitis and diffuse suppuration--
    _whitlow_--_suppurative cellulitis in different situations_--chronic
    suppuration--sinus, fistula--constitutional manifestations of
    pyogenic infection--_sapraemia_--_septicaemia_--_pyaemia_.

suppuration, or the formation of pus, is one of the results of the
action of bacteria on the tissues. the invading organism is usually one
of the staphylococci, less frequently a streptococcus, and still less
frequently one of the other bacteria capable of producing pus, such as
the bacillus coli communis, the gonococcus, the pneumococcus, or the
typhoid bacillus.

so long as the tissues are in a healthy condition they are able to
withstand the attacks of moderate numbers of pyogenic bacteria of
ordinary virulence, but when devitalised by disease, by injury, or by
inflammation due to the action of other pathogenic organisms,
suppuration ensues.

it would appear, for example, that pyogenic organisms can pass through
the healthy urinary tract without doing any damage, but if the pelvis of
the kidney, the ureter, or the bladder is the seat of stone, they give
rise to suppuration. similarly, a calculus in one of the salivary ducts
frequently results in an abscess forming in the floor of the mouth. when
the lumen of a tubular organ, such as the appendix or the fallopian tube
is blocked also, the action of pyogenic organisms is favoured and
suppuration ensues.

#pus.#--the fluid resulting from the process of suppuration is known
as _pus_. in its typical form it is a yellowish creamy substance, of
alkaline reaction, with a specific gravity of about 1030, and it has a
peculiar mawkish odour. if allowed to stand in a test-tube it does not
coagulate, but separates into two layers: the upper, transparent,
straw-coloured fluid, the _liquor puris_ or pus serum, closely
resembling blood serum in its composition, but containing less protein
and more cholestrol; it also contains leucin, tyrosin, and certain
albumoses which prevent coagulation.

the layer at the bottom of the tube consists for the most part of
polymorph leucocytes, and proliferated connective tissue and endothelial
cells (_pus corpuscles_). other forms of leucocytes may be present,
especially in long-standing suppurations; and there are usually some red
corpuscles, dead bacteria, fat cells and shreds of tissue, cholestrol
crystals, and other detritus in the deposit.

if a film of fresh pus is examined under the microscope, the pus cells
are seen to have a well-defined rounded outline, and to contain a finely
granular protoplasm and a multi-partite nucleus; if still warm, the
cells may exhibit amoeboid movement. in stained films the nuclei take the
stain well. in older pus cells the outline is irregular, the protoplasm
coarsely granular, and the nuclei disintegrated, no longer taking the
stain.

_variations from typical pus._--pus from old-standing sinuses is often
watery in consistence (ichorous), with few cells. where the granulations
are vascular and bleed easily, it becomes sanious from admixture with
red corpuscles; while, if a blood-clot be broken down and the debris
mixed with the pus, it contains granules of blood pigment and is said to
be "grumous." the _odour_ of pus varies with the different bacteria
producing it. pus due to ordinary pyogenic cocci has a mawkish odour;
when putrefactive organisms are present it has a putrid odour; when it
forms in the vicinity of the intestinal canal it usually contains the
bacillus coli communis and has a faecal odour.

the _colour_ of pus also varies: when due to one or other of the
varieties of the bacillus pyocyaneus, it is usually of a blue or green
colour; when mixed with bile derivatives or altered blood pigment, it
may be of a bright orange colour. in wounds inflicted with rough iron
implements from which rust is deposited, the pus often presents the same
colour.

the pus may form and collect within a circumscribed area, constituting a
localised _abscess_; or it may infiltrate the tissues over a wide
area--_diffuse suppuration_.


acute circumscribed abscess

any tissue of the body may be the seat of an acute abscess, and there
are many routes by which the bacteria may gain access to the affected
area. for example: an abscess in the integument or subcutaneous
cellular tissue usually results from infection by organisms which have
entered through a wound or abrasion of the surface, or along the ducts
of the skin; an abscess in the breast from organisms which have passed
along the milk ducts opening on the nipple, or along the lymphatics
which accompany these. an abscess in a lymph gland is usually due to
infection passing by way of the lymph channels from the area of skin or
mucous membrane drained by them. abscesses in internal organs, such as
the kidney, liver, or brain, usually result from organisms carried in
the blood-stream from some focus of infection elsewhere in the body.

a knowledge of the possible avenues of infection is of clinical
importance, as it may enable the source of a given abscess to be traced
and dealt with. in suppuration in the fallopian tube (pyosalpynx), for
example, the fact that the most common origin of the infection is in the
genital passage, leads to examination for vaginal discharge; and if none
is present, the abscess is probably due to infection carried in the
blood-stream from some primary focus about the mouth, such as a gumboil
or an infective sore throat.

the exact location of an abscess also may furnish a key to its source;
in axillary abscess, for example, if the suppuration is in the lymph
glands the infection has come through the afferent lymphatics; if in the
cellular tissue, it has spread from the neck or chest wall; if in the
hair follicles, it is a local infection through the skin.

#formation of an abscess.#--when pyogenic bacteria are introduced into
the tissue there ensues an inflammatory reaction, which is characterised
by dilatation of the blood vessels, exudation of large numbers of
leucocytes, and proliferation of connective-tissue cells. these
wandering cells soon accumulate round the focus of infection, and form a
protective barrier which tends to prevent the spread of the organisms
and to restrict their field of action. within the area thus
circumscribed the struggle between the bacteria and the phagocytes takes
place, and in the process toxins are formed by the organisms, a certain
number of the leucocytes succumb, and, becoming degenerated, set free
certain proteolytic enzymes or ferments. the toxins cause
coagulation-necrosis of the tissue cells with which they come in
contact, the ferments liquefy the exudate and other albuminous
substances, and in this way _pus_ is formed.

if the bacteria gain the upper hand, this process of liquefaction which
is characteristic of suppuration, extends into the surrounding tissues,
the protective barrier of leucocytes is broken down, and the
suppurative process spreads. a fresh accession of leucocytes, however,
forms a new barrier, and eventually the spread is arrested, and the
collection of pus so hemmed in constitutes an _abscess_.

owing to the swelling and condensation of the parts around, the pus thus
formed is under considerable pressure, and this causes it to burrow
along the lines of least resistance. in the case of a subcutaneous
abscess the pus usually works its way towards the surface, and "points,"
as it is called. where it approaches the surface the skin becomes soft
and thin, and eventually sloughs, allowing the pus to escape.

an abscess forming in the deeper planes is prevented from pointing
directly to the surface by the firm fasciae and other fibrous structures.
the pus therefore tends to burrow along the line of the blood vessels
and in the connective-tissue septa, till it either finds a weak spot or
causes a portion of fascia to undergo necrosis and so reaches the
surface. accordingly, many abscess cavities resulting from deep-seated
suppuration are of irregular shape, with pouches and loculi in various
directions--an arrangement which interferes with their successful
treatment by incision and drainage.

the relief of tension which follows the bursting of an abscess, the
removal of irritation by the escape of pus, and the casting off of
bacteria and toxins, allow the tissues once more to assert themselves,
and a process of repair sets in. the walls of the abscess fall in;
granulation tissue grows into the space and gradually fills it; and
later this is replaced by cicatricial tissue. as a result of the
subsequent contraction of the cicatricial tissue, the scar is usually
depressed below the level of the surrounding skin surface.

if an abscess is prevented from healing--for example, by the presence of
a foreign body or a piece of necrosed bone--a sinus results, and from it
pus escapes until the foreign body is removed.

#clinical features of an acute circumscribed abscess.#--in the initial
stages the usual symptoms of inflammation are present. increased
elevation of temperature, with or without a rigor, progressive
leucocytosis, and sweating, mark the transition between inflammation and
suppuration. an increasing leucocytosis is evidence that a suppurative
process is spreading.

the local symptoms vary with the seat of the abscess. when it is
situated superficially--for example, in the breast tissue--the affected
area is hot, the redness of inflammation gives place to a dusky purple
colour, with a pale, sometimes yellow, spot where the pus is near the
surface. the swelling increases in size, the firm brawny centre becomes
soft, projects as a cone beyond the level of the rest of the swollen
area, and is usually surrounded by a zone of induration.

by gently palpating with the finger-tips over the softened area, a fluid
wave may be detected--_fluctuation_--and when present this is a certain
indication of the existence of fluid in the swelling. its recognition,
however, is by no means easy, and various fallacies are to be guarded
against in applying this test clinically. when, for example, the walls
of the abscess are thick and rigid, or when its contents are under
excessive tension, the fluid wave cannot be elicited. on the other hand,
a sensation closely resembling fluctuation may often be recognised in
oedematous tissues, in certain soft, solid tumours such as fatty tumours
or vascular sarcomata, in aneurysm, and in a muscle when it is palpated
in its transverse axis.

when pus has formed in deeper parts, and before it has reached the
surface, oedema of the overlying skin is frequently present, and the skin
pits on pressure.

with the formation of pus the continuous burning or boring pain of
inflammation assumes a throbbing character, with occasional sharp,
lancinating twinges. should doubt remain as to the presence of pus,
recourse may be had to the use of an exploring needle.

_differential diagnosis of acute abscess._--a practical difficulty which
frequently arises is to decide whether or not pus has actually formed.
it may be accepted as a working rule in practice that when an acute
inflammation has lasted for four or five days without showing signs of
abatement, suppuration has almost certainly occurred. in deep-seated
suppuration, marked oedema of the skin and the occurrence of rigors and
sweating may be taken to indicate the formation of pus.

there are cases on record where rapidly growing sarcomatous and
angiomatous tumours, aneurysms, and the bruises that occur in
haemophylics, have been mistaken for acute abscesses and incised, with
disastrous results.

#treatment of acute abscesses.#--the dictum of john bell, "where there
is pus, let it out," summarises the treatment of abscess. the extent and
situation of the incision and the means taken to drain the cavity,
however, vary with the nature, site, and relations of the abscess. in a
superficial abscess, for example a bubo, or an abscess in the breast or
face where a disfiguring scar is undesirable, a small puncture should be
made where the pus threatens to point, and a klapp's suction bell be
applied as already described (p. 39). a drain is not necessary, and in
the intervals between the applications of the bell the part is covered
with a moist antiseptic dressing.

in abscesses deeply placed, as for example under the gluteal or pectoral
muscles, one or more incisions should be made, and the cavity drained by
glass or rubber tubes or by strips of rubber tissue.

the wound should be dressed the next day, and the tube shortened, in the
case of a rubber tube, by cutting off a portion of its outer end. on the
second day or later, according to circumstances, the tube is removed,
and after this the dressing need not be repeated oftener than every
second or third day.

where pus has formed in relation to important structures--as, for
example, in the deeper planes of the neck--_hilton's method_ of opening
the abscess may be employed. an incision is made through the skin and
fascia, a grooved director is gently pushed through the deeper tissues
till pus escapes along its groove, and then the track is widened by
passing in a pair of dressing forceps and expanding the blades. a tube,
or strip of rubber tissue, is introduced, and the subsequent treatment
carried out as in other abscesses. when the drain lies in proximity to a
large blood vessel, care must be taken not to leave it in position long
enough to cause ulceration of the vessel wall by pressure.

in some abscesses, such as those in the vicinity of the anus, the cavity
should be laid freely open in its whole extent, stuffed with iodoform or
bismuth gauze, and treated by the open method.

it is seldom advisable to wash out an abscess cavity, and squeezing out
the pus is also to be avoided, lest the protective zone be broken down
and the infection be diffused into the surrounding tissues.

the importance of taking precautions against further infection in
opening an abscess can scarcely be exaggerated, and the rapidity with
which healing occurs when the access of fresh bacteria is prevented is
in marked contrast to what occurs when such precautions are neglected
and further infection is allowed to take place.

_acute suppuration in a wound._--if in the course of an operation
infection of the wound has occurred, a marked inflammatory reaction soon
manifests itself, and the same changes as occur in the formation of an
acute abscess take place, modified, however, by the fact that the pus
can more readily reach the surface. in from twenty-four to forty-eight
hours the patient is conscious of a sensation of chilliness, or may
even have a rigor. at the same time he feels generally out of sorts,
with impaired appetite, headache, and it may be looseness of the bowels.
his temperature rises to 100 o or 101 o f., and the pulse quickens to 100
or 110.

on exposing the wound it is found that the parts for some distance
around are red, glazed, and oedematous. the discoloration and swelling
are most intense in the immediate vicinity of the wound, the edges of
which are everted and moist. any stitches that may have been introduced
are tight, and the deep ones may be cutting into the tissues. there is
heat, and a constant burning or throbbing pain, which is increased by
pressure. if the stitches be cut, pus escapes, the wound gapes, and its
surfaces are found to be inflamed and covered with pus.

the open method is the only safe means of treating such wounds. the
infected surface may be sponged over with pure carbolic acid, the excess
of which is washed off with absolute alcohol, and the wound either
drained by tubes or packed with iodoform gauze. the practice of scraping
such surfaces with the sharp spoon, squeezing or even of washing them
out with antiseptic lotions, is attended with the risk of further
diffusing the organisms in the tissue, and is only to be employed under
exceptional circumstances. continuous irrigation of infected wounds or
their immersion in antiseptic baths is sometimes useful. the free
opening up of the wound is almost immediately followed by a fall in the
temperature. the surrounding inflammation subsides, the discharge of pus
lessens, and healing takes place by the formation of granulation
tissue--the so-called "healing by second intention."

wound infection may take place from _catgut_ which has not been
efficiently prepared. the local and general reactions may be slight,
and, as a rule, do not appear for seven or eight days after the
operation, and, it may be, not till after the skin edges have united.
the suppuration is strictly localised to the part of the wound where
catgut was employed for stitches or ligatures, and shows little tendency
to spread. the infected part, however, is often long of healing. the
irritation in these cases is probably due to toxins in the catgut and
not to bacteria.

when suppuration occurs in connection with buried sutures of
unabsorbable materials, such as silk, silkworm gut, or silver wire, it
is apt to persist till the foreign material is cast off or removed.

suppuration may occur in the track of a skin stitch, producing a _stitch
abscess_. the infection may arise from the material used, especially
catgut or silk, or, more frequently perhaps, from the growth of
staphylococcus albus from the skin of the patient when this has been
imperfectly disinfected. the formation of pus under these conditions may
not be attended with any of the usual signs of suppuration, and beyond
some induration around the wound and a slight tenderness on pressure
there may be nothing to suggest the presence of an abscess.

_acute suppuration of a mucous membrane._--when pyogenic organisms gain
access to a mucous membrane, such as that of the bladder, urethra, or
middle ear, the usual phenomena of acute inflammation and suppuration
ensue, followed by the discharge of pus on the free surface. it would
appear that the most marked changes take place in the submucous tissue,
causing the covering epithelium in places to die and leave small
superficial ulcers, for example in gonorrhoeal urethritis, the
cicatricial contraction of the scar subsequently leading to the
formation of stricture. when mucous glands are present in the membrane,
the pus is mixed with mucus--_muco-pus_.


diffuse cellulitis and diffuse suppuration

cellulitis is an acute affection resulting from the introduction of some
organism--commonly the _streptococcus pyogenes_--into the cellular
connective tissue of the integument, intermuscular septa, tendon
sheaths, or other structures. infection always takes place through a
breach of the surface, although this may be superficial and
insignificant, such as a pin-prick, a scratch, or a crack under a nail,
and the wound may have been healed for some time before the inflammation
becomes manifest. the cellulitis, also, may develop at some distance
from the seat of inoculation, the organisms having travelled by the
lymphatics.

the virulence of the organisms, the loose, open nature of the tissues in
which they develop, and the free lymphatic circulation by means of which
they are spread, account for the diffuse nature of the process.
sometimes numbers of cocci are carried for a considerable distance from
the primary area before they are arrested in the lymphatics, and thus
several patches of inflammation may appear with healthy areas between.

the pus infiltrates the meshes of the cellular tissue, there is
sloughing of considerable portions of tissue of low vitality, such as
fat, fascia, or tendon, and if the process continues for some time
several collections of pus may form.

_clinical features._--the reaction in cases of diffuse cellulitis is
severe, and is usually ushered in by a distinct chill or even a rigor,
while the temperature rises to 103 o, 104 o, or 105 o f. the pulse is
proportionately increased in frequency, and is small, feeble, and often
irregular. the face is flushed, the tongue dry and brown, and the
patient may become delirious, especially during the night. leucocytosis
is present in cases of moderate severity; but in severe cases the
virulence of the toxins prevents reaction taking place, and leucocytosis
is absent.

the local manifestations vary with the relation of the seat of the
inflammation to the surface. when the superficial cellular tissue is
involved, the skin assumes a dark bluish-red colour, is swollen,
oedematous, and the seat of burning pain. to the touch it is firm, hot,
and tender. when the primary focus is in the deeper tissues, the
constitutional disturbance is aggravated, while the local signs are
delayed, and only become prominent when pus forms and approaches the
surface. it is not uncommon for blebs containing dark serous fluid to
form on the skin. the infection frequently spreads along the line of the
main lymph vessels of the part (_septic lymphangitis_) and may reach the
lymph glands (_septic lymphadenitis_).

with the formation of pus the skin becomes soft and boggy at several
points, and eventually breaks, giving exit to a quantity of thick
grumous discharge. sometimes several small collections under the skin
fuse, and an abscess is formed in which fluctuation can be detected.
occasionally gases are evolved in the tissues, giving rise to emphysema.
it is common for portions of fascia, ligaments, or tendons to slough,
and this may often be recognised clinically by a peculiar crunching or
grating sensation transmitted to the fingers on making firm pressure on
the part.

if it is not let out by incision, the pus, travelling along the lines of
least resistance, tends to point at several places on the surface, or to
open into joints or other cavities.

_prognosis._--the occurrence of _septicaemia_ is the most serious risk,
and it is in cases of diffuse suppurative cellulitis that this form of
blood-poisoning assumes its most aggravated forms. the toxins of the
streptococci are exceedingly virulent, and induce local death of tissue
so rapidly that the protective emigration of leucocytes fails to take
place. in some cases the passage of masses of free cocci in the
lymphatics, or of infective emboli in the blood vessels, leads to the
formation of _pyogenic abscesses_ in vital organs, such as the brain,
lungs, liver, kidneys, or other viscera. _haemorrhage_ from erosion of
arterial or venous trunks may take place and endanger life.

_treatment._--the treatment of diffuse cellulitis depends to a large
extent on the situation and extent of the affected area, and on the
stage of the process.

_in the limbs_, for example, where the application of a constricting
band is practicable, bier's method of inducing passive hyperaemia yields
excellent results. if pus is formed, one or more small incisions are
made and a light moist dressing placed over the wounds to absorb the
discharge, but no drain is inserted. the whole of the inflamed area
should be covered with gauze wrung out of a 1 in 10 solution of ichthyol
in glycerine. the dressing is changed as often as necessary, and in the
intervals when the band is off, gentle active and passive movements
should be carried out to prevent the formation of adhesions. after
incisions have been made, we have found the _immersion_ of the limb, for
a few hours at a time, in a water-bath containing warm boracic lotion or
eusol a useful adjuvant to the passive hyperaemia.

_continuous irrigation_ of the part by a slow, steady stream of lotion,
at the body temperature, such as eusol, or dakin's solution, or boracic
acid, or frequent washing with peroxide of hydrogen, has been found of
value.

a suitably arranged splint adds to the comfort of the patient; and the
limb should be placed in the attitude which, in the event of stiffness
resulting, will least interfere with its usefulness. the elbow, for
example, should be flexed to a little less than a right angle; at the
wrist, the hand should be dorsiflexed and the fingers flexed slightly
towards the palm.

massage, passive movement, hot and cold douching, and other measures,
may be necessary to get rid of the chronic oedema, adhesions of tendons,
and stiffness of joints which sometimes remain.

in situations where a constricting band cannot be applied, for example,
on the trunk or the neck, klapp's suction bells may be used, small
incisions being made to admit of the escape of pus.

if these measures fail or are impracticable, it may be necessary to make
one or more free incisions, and to insert drainage-tubes, portions of
rubber dam, or iodoform worsted.

the general treatment of toxaemia must be carried out, and in cases due
to infection by streptococci, anti-streptococcic serum may be used.

in a few cases, amputation well above the seat of disease, by removing
the source of toxin production, offers the only means of saving the
patient.


whitlow

the clinical term whitlow is applied to an acute infection, usually
followed by suppuration, commonly met with in the fingers, less
frequently in the toes. the point of infection is often trivial--a
pin-prick, a puncture caused by a splinter of wood, a scratch, or even
an imperceptible lesion of the skin.

several varieties of whitlow are recognised, but while it is convenient
to describe them separately, it is to be clearly understood that
clinically they merge one into another, and it is not always possible to
determine in which connective-tissue plane a given infection has
originated.

_initial stage._--attention is usually first attracted to the condition
by a sensation of tightness in the finger and tenderness when the part
is squeezed or knocked against anything. in the course of a few hours
the part becomes red and swollen; there is continuous pain, which soon
assumes a throbbing character, particularly when the hand is dependent,
and may be so severe as to prevent sleep, and the patient may feel
generally out of sorts.

if a constricting band is applied at this stage, the infection can
usually be checked and the occurrence of suppuration prevented. if this
fails, or if the condition is allowed to go untreated, the inflammatory
reaction increases and terminates in suppuration, giving rise to one or
other of the forms of whitlow to be described.

_the purulent blister._--in the most superficial variety, pus forms
between the rete malpighii and the stratum corneum of the skin, the
latter being raised as a blister in which fluctuation can be detected
(fig. 9, a). this is commonly met with in the palm of the hand of
labouring men who have recently resumed work after a spell of idleness.
when the blister forms near the tip of the finger, the pus burrows under
the nail--which corresponds to the stratum corneum--raising it from its
bed.

there is some local heat and discoloration, and considerable pain and
tenderness, but little or no constitutional disturbance. superficial
lymphangitis may extend a short distance up the forearm. by clipping
away the raised epidermis, and if necessary the nail, the pus is allowed
to escape, and healing speedily takes place.

_whitlow at the nail fold._--this variety, which is met with among those
who handle septic material, occurs in the sulcus between the nail and
the skin, and is due to the introduction of infective matter at the root
of the nail (fig. 9, b). a small focus of suppuration forms under the
nail, with swelling and redness of the nail fold, causing intense pain
and discomfort, interfering with sleep, and producing a constitutional
reaction out of all proportion to the local lesion.

to allow the pus to escape, it is necessary, under local anaesthesia, to
cut away the nail fold as well as the portion of nail in the infected
area, or, it may be, to remove the nail entirely. if only a small
opening is made in the nail it is apt to be blocked by granulations.

[illustration: fig. 9.--diagram of various forms of whitlow.
  a = purulent blister.
  b = suppuration at nail fold.
  c = subcutaneous whitlow.
  d = whitlow in sheath of flexor tendon (e). ]

_subcutaneous whitlow._--in this variety the infection manifests itself
as a cellulitis of the pulp of the finger (fig. 9, c), which sometimes
spreads towards the palm of the hand. the finger becomes red, swollen,
and tense; there is severe throbbing pain, which is usually worst at
night and prevents sleep, and the part is extremely tender on pressure.
when the palm is invaded there may be marked oedema of the back of the
hand, the dense integument of the palm preventing the swelling from
appearing on the front. the pus may be under such tension that
fluctuation cannot be detected. the patient is usually able to flex the
finger to a certain extent without increasing the pain--a point which
indicates that the tendon sheaths have not been invaded. the
suppurative process may, however, spread to the tendon sheaths, or even
to the bone. sometimes the excessive tension and virulent toxins induce
actual gangrene of the distal part, or even of the whole finger. there
is considerable constitutional disturbance, the temperature often
reaching 101 o or 102 o f.

the treatment consists in applying a constriction band and making an
incision over the centre of the most tender area, care being taken to
avoid opening the tendon sheath lest the infection be conveyed to it.
moist dressings should be employed while the suppuration lasts. carbolic
fomentations, however, are to be avoided on account of the risk of
inducing gangrene.

_whitlow of the tendon sheaths._--in this form the main incidence of the
infection is on the sheaths of the flexor tendons, but it is not always
possible to determine whether it started there or spread thither from
the subcutaneous cellular tissue (fig. 9, d). in some cases both
connective tissue planes are involved. the affected finger becomes red,
painful, and swollen, the swelling spreading to the dorsum. the
involvement of the tendon sheath is usually indicated by the patient
being unable to flex the finger, and by the pain being increased when he
attempts to do so. on account of the anatomical arrangement of the
tendon sheaths, the process may spread into the forearm--directly in the
case of the thumb and little finger, and after invading the palm in the
case of the other fingers--and there give rise to a diffuse cellulitis
which may result in sloughing of fasciae and tendons. when the infection
spreads into the common flexor sheath under the transverse carpal
(anterior annular) ligament, it is not uncommon for the intercarpal and
wrist joints to become implicated. impaired movement of tendons and
joints is, therefore, a common sequel to this variety of whitlow.

the _treatment_ consists in inducing passive hyperaemia by bier's method,
and, if this is done early, suppuration may be avoided. if pus forms,
small incisions are made, under local anaesthesia, to relieve the tension
in the sheath and to diminish the risk of the tendons sloughing. no form
of drain should be inserted. in the fingers the incisions should be made
in the middle line, and in the palm they should be made over the
metacarpal bones to avoid the digital vessels and nerves. if pus has
spread under the transverse carpal ligament, the incision must be made
above the wrist. passive movements and massage must be commenced as
early as possible and be perseveringly employed to diminish the
formation of adhesions and resulting stiffness.

_subperiosteal whitlow._--this form is usually an extension of the
subcutaneous or of the thecal variety, but in some cases the
inflammation begins in the periosteum--usually of the terminal phalanx.
it may lead to necrosis of a portion or even of the entire phalanx. this
is usually recognised by the persistence of suppuration long after the
acute symptoms have passed off, and by feeling bare bone with the probe.
in such cases one or more of the joints are usually implicated also, and
lateral mobility and grating may be elicited. recovery does not take
place until the dead bone is removed, and the usefulness of the finger
is often seriously impaired by fibrous or bony ankylosis of the
interphalangeal joints. this may render amputation advisable when a
stiff finger is likely to interfere with the patient's occupation.


suppurative cellulitis in different situations

_cellulitis of the forearm_ is usually a sequel to one of the deeper
varieties of whitlow.

in the _region of the elbow-joint_, cellulitis is common around the
olecranon. it may originate as an inflammation of the olecranon bursa,
or may invade the bursa secondarily. in exceptional cases the
elbow-joint is also involved.

cellulitis of the _axilla_ may originate in suppuration in the lymph
glands, following an infected wound of the hand, or it may spread from a
septic wound on the chest wall or in the neck. in some cases it is
impossible to discover the primary seat of infection. a firm, brawny
swelling forms in the armpit and extends on to the chest wall. it is
attended with great pain, which is increased on moving the arm, and
there is marked constitutional disturbance. when suppuration occurs, its
spread is limited by the attachments of the axillary fascia, and the pus
tends to burrow on to the chest wall beneath the pectoral muscles, and
upwards towards the shoulder-joint, which may become infected. when the
pus forms in the axillary space, the treatment consists in making free
incisions, which should be placed on the thoracic side of the axilla to
avoid the axillary vessels and nerves. if the pus spreads on to the
chest wall, the abscess should be opened below the clavicle by hilton's
method, and a counter opening may be made in the axilla.

cellulitis of the _sole of the foot_ may follow whitlow of the toes.

in the _region of the ankle_ cellulitis is not common; but _around the
knee_ it frequently occurs in relation to the prepatellar bursa and to
the popliteal lymph glands, and may endanger the knee-joint. it is also
met with in the _groin_ following on inflammation and suppuration of the
inguinal glands, and cases are recorded in which the sloughing process
has implicated the femoral vessels and led to secondary haemorrhage.

cellulitis of the scalp, orbit, neck, pelvis, and perineum will be
considered with the diseases of these regions.


chronic suppuration

while it is true that a chronic pyogenic abscess is sometimes met
with--for example, in the breast and in the marrow of long bones--in the
great majority of instances the formation of a chronic or cold abscess
is the result of the action of the tubercle bacillus. it is therefore
more convenient to study this form of suppuration with tuberculosis
(p. 139).


sinus and fistula

#sinus.#--a sinus is a track leading from a focus of suppuration to a
cutaneous or mucous surface. it usually represents the path by which the
discharge escapes from an abscess cavity that has been prevented from
closing completely, either from mechanical causes or from the persistent
formation of discharge which must find an exit. a sinus is lined by
granulation tissue, and when it is of long standing the opening may be
dragged below the level of the surrounding skin by contraction of the
scar tissue around it. as a sinus will persist until the obstacle to
closure of the original abscess is removed, it is necessary that this
should be sought for. it may be a foreign body, such as a piece of dead
bone, an infected ligature, or a bullet, acting mechanically or by
keeping up discharge, and if the body is removed the sinus usually
heals. the presence of a foreign body is often suggested by a mass of
redundant granulations at the mouth of the sinus. if a sinus passes
through a muscle, the repeated contractions tend to prevent healing
until the muscle is kept at rest by a splint, or put out of action by
division of its fibres. the sinuses associated with empyema are
prevented from healing by the rigidity of the chest wall, and will only
close after an operation which admits of the cavity being obliterated.
in any case it is necessary to disinfect the track, and, it may be, to
remove the unhealthy granulations lining it, by means of the sharp
spoon, or to excise it bodily. to encourage healing from the bottom the
cavity should be packed with bismuth or iodoform gauze. the healing of
long and tortuous sinuses is often hastened by the injection of beck's
bismuth paste (p. 145). if disfigurement is likely to follow from
cicatricial contraction--for example, in a sinus over the lower jaw
associated with a carious tooth--the sinus should be excised and the raw
surfaces approximated with stitches.

the _tuberculous sinus_ is described under tuberculosis.

a #fistula# is an abnormal canal passing from a mucous surface to the
skin or to another mucous surface. fistulae resulting from suppuration
usually occur near the natural openings of mucous canals--for example,
on the cheek, as a salivary fistula; beside the inner angle of the eye,
as a lacrymal fistula; near the ear, as a mastoid fistula; or close to
the anus, as a fistula-in-ano. intestinal fistulae are sometimes met with
in the abdominal wall after strangulated hernia, operations for
appendicitis, tuberculous peritonitis, and other conditions. in the
perineum, fistulae frequently complicate stricture of the urethra.

fistulae also occur between the bladder and vagina (_vesico-vaginal
fistula_), or between the bladder and the rectum (_recto-vesical
fistula_).

the _treatment_ of these various forms of fistula will be described in
the sections dealing with the regions in which they occur.

_congenital fistulae_, such as occur in the neck from imperfect closure
of branchial clefts, or in the abdomen from unobliterated foetal ducts
such as the urachus or meckel's diverticulum, will be described in their
proper places.


constitutional manifestations of pyogenic infection

we have here to consider under the terms sapraemia, septicaemia, and
pyaemia certain general effects of pyogenic infection, which, although
their clinical manifestations may vary, are all associated with the
action of the same forms of bacteria. they may occur separately or in
combination, or one may follow on and merge into another.

#sapraemia#, or septic intoxication, is the name applied to a form of
poisoning resulting from the absorption into the blood of the toxic
products of pyogenic bacteria. these products, which are of the nature
of alkaloids, act immediately on their entrance into the circulation,
and produce effects in direct proportion to the amount absorbed. as the
toxins are gradually eliminated from the body the symptoms abate, and if
no more are introduced they disappear. sapraemia in these respects,
therefore, is comparable to poisoning by any other form of alkaloid,
such as strychnin or morphin.

_clinical features._--the symptoms of sapraemia seldom manifest
themselves within twenty-four hours of an operation or injury, because
it takes some time for the bacteria to produce a sufficient dose of
their poisons. the onset of the condition is marked by a feeling of
chilliness, sometimes amounting to a rigor, and a rise of temperature to
102 o, 103 o, or 104 o f., with morning remissions (fig. 10). the heart's
action is markedly depressed, and the pulse is soft and compressible.
the appetite is lost, the tongue dry and covered with a thin
brownish-red fur, so that it has the appearance of "dried beef." the
urine is scanty and loaded with urates. in severe cases diarrhoea and
vomiting of dark coffee-ground material are often prominent features.
death is usually impending when the skin becomes cold and clammy, the
mucous membranes livid, the pulse feeble and fluttering, the discharges
involuntary, and when a low form of muttering delirium is present.

[illustration: fig. 10.--charts of acute sapraemia from (a) case of
crushed foot, and (b) case of incomplete abortion.]

a local form of septic infection is always present--it may be an
abscess, an infected compound fracture, or an infection of the cavity of
the uterus, for example, from a retained portion of placenta.

_treatment._--the first indication is the immediate and complete removal
of the infected material. the wound must be freely opened, all
blood-clot, discharge, or necrosed tissue removed, and the area
disinfected by washing with sterilised salt solution, peroxide of
hydrogen, or eusol. stronger lotions are to be avoided as being likely
to depress the tissues, and so interfere with protective phagocytosis.
on account of its power of neutralising toxins, iodoform is useful in
these cases, and is best employed by packing the wound with iodoform
gauze, and treating it by the open method, if this is possible.

the general treatment is carried out on the same lines as for other
infective conditions.

#chronic sapraemia or hectic fever.#--hectic fever differs from acute
sapraemia merely in degree. it usually occurs in connection with
tuberculous conditions, such as bone or joint disease, psoas abscess, or
empyema, which have opened externally, and have thereby become infected
with pyogenic organisms. it is gradual in its development, and is of a
mild type throughout.

[illustration: fig. 11.--chart of hectic fever.]

the pulse is small, feeble, and compressible, and the temperature rises
in the afternoon or evening to 102 o or 103 o f. (fig. 11), the cheeks
becoming characteristically flushed. in the early morning the
temperature falls to normal or below it, and the patient breaks into a
profuse perspiration, which leaves him pale, weak, and exhausted. he
becomes rapidly and markedly emaciated, even although in some cases the
appetite remains good and is even voracious.

the poisons circulating in the blood produce _waxy degeneration_ in
certain viscera, notably the liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestines. the
process begins in the arterial walls, and spreads thence to the
connective-tissue structures, causing marked enlargement of the affected
organs. albuminuria, ascites, oedema of the lower limbs, clubbing of the
fingers, and diarrhoea are among the most prominent symptoms of this
condition.

the _prognosis_ in hectic fever depends on the completeness with which
the further absorption of toxins can be prevented. in many cases this
can only be effected by an operation which provides for free drainage,
and, if possible, the removal of infected tissues. the resulting wound
is best treated by the open method. even advanced waxy degeneration does
not contra-indicate this line of treatment, as the diseased organs
usually recover if the focus from which absorption of toxic material is
taking place is completely eradicated.

[illustration: fig. 12.--chart of case of septicaemia followed by
pyaemia.]

#septicaemia.#--this form of blood-poisoning is the result of the action
of pyogenic bacteria, which not only produce their toxins at the primary
seat of infection, but themselves enter the blood-stream and are carried
to other parts, where they settle and produce further effects.

_clinical features._--there may be an incubation period of some hours
between the infection and the first manifestation of acute septicaemia.
in such conditions as acute osteomyelitis or acute peritonitis, we see
the most typical clinical pictures of this condition. the onset is
marked by a chill, or a rigor, which may be repeated, while the
temperature rises to 103 o or 104 o f., although in very severe cases the
temperature may remain subnormal throughout, the virulence of the toxins
preventing reaction. it is in the general appearance of the patient and
in the condition of the pulse that we have our best guides as to the
severity of the condition. if the pulse remains firm, full, and regular,
and does not exceed 110 or even 120, while the temperature is moderately
raised, the outlook is hopeful; but when the pulse becomes small and
compressible, and reaches 130 or more, especially if at the same time
the temperature is low, a grave prognosis is indicated. the tongue is
often dry and coated with a black crust down the centre, while the sides
are red. it is a good omen when the tongue becomes moist again. thirst
is most distressing, especially in septicaemia of intestinal origin.
persistent vomiting of dark-brown material is often present, and
diarrhoea with blood-stained stools is not uncommon. the urine is small
in amount, and contains a large proportion of urates. as the poisons
accumulate, the respiration becomes shallow and laboured, the face of a
dull ashy grey, the nose pinched, and the skin cold and clammy.
capillary haemorrhages sometimes take place in the skin or mucous
membranes; and in a certain proportion of cases cutaneous eruptions
simulating those of scarlet fever or measles appear, and are apt to lead
to errors in diagnosis. in other cases there is slight jaundice. the
mental state is often one of complete apathy, the patient failing to
realise the gravity of his condition; sometimes there is delirium.

the _prognosis_ is always grave, and depends on the possibility of
completely eradicating the focus of infection, and on the reserve force
the patient has to carry him over the period during which he is
eliminating the poison already circulating in his blood.

the _treatment_ is carried out on the same lines as in sapraemia, but it
is less likely to be successful owing to the organisms having entered
the circulation. when possible, the primary focus of infection should be
dealt with.

#pyaemia# is a form of blood-poisoning characterised by the development
of secondary foci of suppuration in different parts of the body. toxins
are thus introduced into the blood, not only at the primary seat of
infection, but also from each of these metastatic collections. like
septicaemia, this condition is due to pyogenic bacteria, the
_streptococcus pyogenes_ being the commonest organism found. the primary
infection is usually in a wound--for example, a compound fracture--but
cases occur in which the point of entrance of the bacteria is not
discoverable. the dissemination of the organisms takes place through the
medium of infected emboli which form in a thrombosed vein in the
vicinity of the original lesion, and, breaking loose, are carried
thence in the blood-stream. these emboli lodge in the minute vessels of
the lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleura, brain, synovial membranes, or
cellular tissue, and the bacteria they contain give rise to secondary
foci of suppuration. secondary abscesses are thus formed in those parts,
and these in turn may be the starting-point of new emboli which give
rise to fresh areas of pus formation. the organs above named are the
commonest situations of pyaemic abscesses, but these may also occur in
the bone marrow, the substance of muscles, the heart and pericardium,
lymph glands, subcutaneous tissue, or, in fact, in any tissue of the
body. organisms circulating in the blood are prone to lodge on the
valves of the heart and give rise to endocarditis.

[illustration: fig. 13.--chart of pyaemia following on acute
osteomyelitis.]

_clinical features._--before antiseptic surgery was practised, pyaemia
was a common complication of wounds. in the present day it is not only
infinitely less common, but appears also to be of a less severe type.
its rarity and its mildness may be related as cause and effect, because
it was formerly found that pyaemia contracted from a pyaemic patient was
more virulent than that from other sources.

in contrast with sapraemia and septicaemia, pyaemia is late of developing,
and it seldom begins within a week of the primary infection. the first
sign is a feeling of chilliness, or a violent rigor lasting for perhaps
half an hour, during which time the temperature rises to 103 o, 104 o, or
105 o f. in the course of an hour it begins to fall again, and the
patient breaks into a profuse sweat. the temperature may fall several
degrees, but seldom reaches the normal. in a few days there is a second
rigor with rise of temperature, and another remission, and such attacks
may be repeated at diminishing intervals during the course of the
illness (figs. 12 and 13). the pulse is soft, and tends to remain
abnormally rapid even when the temperature falls nearly to normal.

the face is flushed, and wears a drawn, anxious expression, and the eyes
are bright. a characteristic sweetish odour, which has been compared to
that of new-mown hay, can be detected in the breath and may pervade the
patient. the appetite is lost; there may be sickness and vomiting and
profuse diarrhoea; and the patient emaciates rapidly. the skin is
continuously hot, and has often a peculiar pungent feel. patches of
erythema sometimes appear scattered over the body. the skin may assume a
dull sallow or earthy hue, or a bright yellow icteric tint may appear.
the conjunctivae also may be yellow. in the latter stages of the disease
the pulse becomes small and fluttering; the tongue becomes dry and
brown; sordes collect on the teeth; and a low muttering form of delirium
supervenes.

secondary infection of the parotid gland frequently occurs, and gives
rise to a suppurative parotitis. this condition is associated with
severe pain, gradually extending from behind the angle of the jaw on to
the face. there is also swelling over the gland, and eventually
suppuration and sloughing of the gland tissue and overlying skin.

secondary abscesses in the lymph glands, subcutaneous tissue, or joints
are often so insidious and painless in their development that they are
only discovered accidentally. when the abscess is evacuated, healing
often takes place with remarkable rapidity, and with little impairment
of function.

the general symptoms may be simulated by an attack of malaria.

_prognosis._--the prognosis in acute pyaemia is much less hopeless than
it once was, a considerable proportion of the patients recovering. in
acute cases the disease proves fatal in ten days or a fortnight, death
being due to toxaemia. chronic cases often run a long course, lasting for
weeks or even months, and prove fatal from exhaustion and waxy disease
following on prolonged suppuration.

_treatment._--in such conditions as compound fractures and severe
lacerated wounds, much can be done to avert the conditions which lead to
pyaemia, by applying a bier's constricting bandage as soon as there is
evidence of infection having taken place, or even if there is reason to
suspect that the wound is not aseptic.

if sepsis is already established, and evidence of general infection is
present, the wound should be opened up sufficiently to admit of thorough
disinfection and drainage, and the constricting bandage applied to aid
the defensive processes going on in the tissues. if these measures fail,
amputation of the limb may be the only means of preventing further
dissemination of infective material from the primary source of
infection.

attempts have been made to interrupt the channel along which the
infective emboli spread, by ligating or resecting the main vein of the
affected part, but this is seldom feasible except in the case of the
internal jugular vein for infection of the transverse sinus.

secondary abscesses must be aspirated or opened and drained whenever
possible.

the general treatment is conducted on the same lines as on other forms
of pyogenic infection.




chapter v

ulceration and ulcers


definitions--clinical examination of an ulcer--the healing
    sore.--classification of ulcers--a. according to cause:
    _traumatism_, _imperfect circulation_, _imperfect nerve-supply_,
    _constitutional causes_--b. according to condition: _healing_,
    _stationary_, _spreading_.--treatment.

the process of _ulceration_ may be defined as the molecular or cellular
death of tissue taking place on a free surface. it is essentially of the
same nature as the process of suppuration, only that the purulent
discharge, instead of collecting in a closed cavity and forming an
abscess, at once escapes on the surface.

an _ulcer_ is an open wound or sore in which there are present certain
conditions tending to prevent it undergoing the natural process of
repair. of these, one of the most important is the presence of
pathogenic bacteria, which by their action not only prevent healing, but
so irritate and destroy the tissues as to lead to an actual increase in
the size of the sore. interference with the nutrition of a part by oedema
or chronic venous congestion may impede healing; as may also induration
of the surrounding area, by preventing the contraction which is such an
important factor in repair. defective innervation, such as occurs in
injuries and diseases of the spinal cord, also plays an important part
in delaying repair. in certain constitutional conditions, too--for
example, bright's disease, diabetes, or syphilis--the vitiated state of
the tissues is an impediment to repair. mechanical causes, such as
unsuitable dressings or ill-fitting appliances, may also act in the same
direction.

#clinical examination of an ulcer.#--in examining any ulcer, we
observe--(1) its _base_ or _floor_, noting the presence or absence of
granulations, their disposition, size, colour, vascularity, and whether
they are depressed or elevated in relation to the surrounding parts. (2)
the _discharge_ as to quantity, consistence, colour, composition, and
odour. (3) the _edges_, noting particularly whether or not the marginal
epithelium is attempting to grow over the surface; also their shape,
regularity, thickness, and whether undermined or overlapping, everted or
depressed. (4) the _surrounding tissues_, as to whether they are
congested, oedematous, inflamed, indurated, or otherwise. (5) whether or
not there is _pain_ or tenderness in the raw surface or its
surroundings. (6) the _part of the body_ on which it occurs, because
certain ulcers have special seats of election--for example, the varicose
ulcer in the lower third of the leg, the perforating ulcer on the sole
of the foot, and so on.

#the healing sore.#--if a portion of skin be excised aseptically, and no
attempt made to close the wound, the raw surface left is soon covered
over with a layer of coagulated blood and lymph. in the course of a few
days this is replaced by the growth of _granulations_, which are of
uniform size, of a pinkish-red colour, and moist with a slight serous
exudate containing a few dead leucocytes. they grow until they reach the
level of the surrounding skin, and so fill the gap with a fine velvety
mass of granulation tissue. at the edges, the young epithelium may be
seen spreading in over the granulations as a fine bluish-white pellicle,
which gradually covers the sore, becoming paler in colour as it
thickens, and eventually forming the smooth, non-vascular covering of
the cicatrix. there is no pain, and the surrounding parts are healthy.

this may be used as a type with which to compare the ulcers seen at the
bedside, so that we may determine how far, and in what particulars,
these differ from the type; and that we may in addition recognise the
conditions that have to be counteracted before the characters of the
typical healing sore are assumed.

for purposes of contrast we may indicate the characters of an open sore
in which bacterial infection with pathogenic bacteria has taken place.
the layer of coagulated blood and lymph becomes liquefied and is thrown
off, and instead of granulations being formed, the tissues exposed on
the floor of the ulcer are destroyed by the bacterial toxins, with the
formation of minute sloughs and a quantity of pus.

the discharge is profuse, thin, acrid, and offensive, and consists of
pus, broken-down blood-clot, and sloughs. the edges are inflamed,
irregular, and ragged, showing no sign of growing epithelium--on the
contrary, the sore may be actually increasing in area by the
breaking-down of the tissues at its margins. the surrounding parts are
hot, red, swollen, and oedematous; and there is pain and tenderness both
in the sore itself and in the parts around.

#classification of ulcers.#--the nomenclature of ulcers is much involved
and gives rise to great confusion, chiefly for the reason that no one
basis of classification has been adopted. thus some ulcers are named
according to the causes at work in producing or maintaining them--for
example, the traumatic, the septic, and the varicose ulcer; some from
the constitutional element present, as the gouty and the diabetic ulcer;
and others according to the condition in which they happen to be when
seen by the surgeon, such as the weak, the inflamed, and the callous
ulcer.

so long as we retain these names it will be impossible to find a single
basis for classification; and yet many of the terms are so descriptive
and so generally understood that it is undesirable to abolish them. we
must therefore remain content with a clinical arrangement of ulcers,--it
cannot be called a classification,--considering any given ulcer from two
points of view: first its _cause_, and second its _present condition_.
this method of studying ulcers has the practical advantage that it
furnishes us with the main indications for treatment as well as for
diagnosis: the cause must be removed, and the condition so modified as
to convert the ulcer into an aseptic healing sore.

a. #arrangement of ulcers according to their cause.#--although any given
ulcer may be due to a combination of causes, it is convenient to
describe the following groups:

_ulcers due to traumatism._--traumatism in the form of a _crush_ or
_bruise_ is a frequent cause of ulcer formation, acting either by
directly destroying the skin, or by so diminishing its vitality that it
is rendered a suitable soil for bacteria. if these gain access, in the
course of a few days the damaged area of skin becomes of a greyish
colour, blebs form on it, and it undergoes necrosis, leaving an
unhealthy raw surface when the slough separates.

_heat_ and _prolonged exposure to the rontgen rays_ or _to radium
emanations_ act in a similar way.

the _pressure_ of improperly padded splints or other appliances may so
far interfere with the circulation of the part pressed upon, that the
skin sloughs, leaving an open sore. this is most liable to occur in
patients who suffer from some nerve lesion--such as anterior
poliomyelitis, or injury of the spinal cord or nerve-trunks.
splint-pressure sores are usually situated over bony prominences, such
as the malleoli, the condyles of the femur or humerus, the head of the
fibula, the dorsum of the foot, or the base of the fifth metatarsal
bone. on removing the splint, the skin of the part pressed upon is found
to be of a red or pink colour, with a pale grey patch in the centre,
which eventually sloughs and leaves an ulcer. certain forms of
_bed-sore_ are also due to prolonged pressure.

pressure sores are also known to have been produced artificially by
malingerers and hysterical subjects.

[illustration: fig. 14.--leg ulcers associated with varicose veins and
pigmentation of the skin.]

_ulcers due to imperfect circulation._--imperfect circulation is an
important causative factor in ulceration, especially when it is the
_venous return_ that is defective. this is best illustrated in the
so-called _leg ulcer_, which occurs most frequently on the front and
medial aspect of the lower third of the leg. at this point the
anastomosis between the superficial and deep veins of the leg is less
free than elsewhere, so that the extra stress thrown upon the surface
veins interferes with the nutrition of the skin (hilton). the importance
of imperfect venous return in the causation of such ulcers is evidenced
by the fact that as soon as the condition of the circulation is improved
by confining the patient to bed and elevating the limb, the ulcer begins
to heal, even although all methods of local treatment have hitherto
proved ineffectual. in a considerable number of cases, but by no means
in all, this form of ulcer is associated with the presence of varicose
veins, and in such cases it is spoken of as the _varicose ulcer_ (fig. 14).
the presence of varicose veins is frequently associated with a
diffuse brownish or bluish pigmentation of the skin of the lower third
of the leg, or with an obstinate form of dermatitis (_varicose eczema_),
and the scratching or rubbing of the part is liable to cause a breach of
the surface and permit of infection which leads to ulceration. varicose
ulcers may also originate from the bursting of a small peri-phlebitic
abscess.

varicose veins in immediate relation to the base of a large chronic
ulcer usually become thrombosed, and in time are reduced to fibrous
cords, and therefore in such cases haemorrhage is not a common
complication. in smaller and more superficial ulcers, however, the
destructive process is liable to implicate the wall of the vessel before
the occurrence of thrombosis, and to lead to profuse and it may be
dangerous bleeding.

these ulcers are at first small and superficial, but from want of care,
from continued standing or walking, or from injudicious treatment, they
gradually become larger and deeper. they are not infrequently multiple,
and this, together with their depth, may lead to their being mistaken
for ulcers due to syphilis. the base of the ulcer is covered with
imperfectly formed, soft, oedematous granulations, which give off a thin
sero-purulent discharge. the edges are slightly inflamed, and show no
evidence of healing. the parts around are usually pigmented and slightly
oedematous, and as a rule there is little pain. this variety of ulcer is
particularly prone to pass into the condition known as callous.

in _anaemic_ patients, especially young girls, ulcers are occasionally
met with which have many of the clinical characters of those associated
with imperfect venous return. they are slow to heal, and tend to pass
into the condition known as weak.

_ulcers due to interference with nerve-supply._--any interference with
the nerve-supply of the superficial tissues predisposes to ulceration.
for example, _trophic_ ulcers are liable to occur in injuries or
diseases of the spinal cord, in cerebral paralysis, in limbs weakened by
poliomyelitis, in ascending or peripheral neuritis, or after injuries of
nerve-trunks.

the _acute bed-sore_ is a rapidly progressing form of ulceration, often
amounting to gangrene, of portions of skin exposed to pressure when
their trophic nerve-supply has been interfered with.

[illustration: fig. 15.--perforating ulcers of sole of foot.

(from photograph lent by sir montagu cotterill.)]

the _perforating ulcer of the foot_ is a peculiar type of sore which
occurs in association with the different forms of peripheral neuritis,
and with various lesions of the brain and spinal cord, such as general
paralysis, locomotor ataxia, or syringo-myelia (fig. 15). it also occurs
in patients suffering from glycosuria, and is usually associated with
arterio-sclerosis--local or general. perforating ulcer is met with most
frequently under the head of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. a
callosity forms and suppuration occurs under it, the pus escaping
through a small hole in the centre. the process slowly and gradually
spreads deeper and deeper, till eventually the bone or joint is reached,
and becomes implicated in the destructive process--hence the term
"perforating ulcer." the flexor tendons are sometimes destroyed, the toe
being dorsiflexed by the unopposed extensors. the depth of the track
being so disproportionate to its superficial area, the condition closely
simulates a tuberculous sinus, for which it is liable to be mistaken.
the raw surface is absolutely insensitive, so that the probe can be
freely employed without the patient even being aware of it or suffering
the least discomfort--a significant fact in diagnosis. the cavity is
filled with effete and decomposing epidermis, which has a most offensive
odour. the chronic and intractable character of the ulcer is due to
interference with the trophic nerve-supply of the parts, and to the fact
that the epithelium of the skin grows in and lines the track leading
down to the deepest part of the ulcer and so prevents closure. while
they are commonest on the sole of the foot and other parts subjected to
pressure, perforating ulcers are met with on the sides and dorsum of the
foot and toes, on the hands, and on other parts where no pressure has
been exerted.

the _tuberculous ulcer_, so often seen in the neck, in the vicinity of
joints, or over the ribs and sternum, usually results from the bursting
through the skin of a tuberculous abscess. the base is soft, pale, and
covered with feeble granulations and grey shreddy sloughs. the edges are
of a dull blue or purple colour, and gradually thin out towards their
free margins, and in addition are characteristically undermined, so that
a probe can be passed for some distance between the floor of the ulcer
and the thinned-out edges. thin, devitalised tags of skin often stretch
from side to side of the ulcer. the outline is irregular; small
perforations often occur through the skin, and a thin, watery discharge,
containing grey shreds of tuberculous debris, escapes.

_bazin's disease._--this term is applied to an affection of the skin and
subcutaneous tissue which bears certain resemblances to tuberculosis. it
is met with almost exclusively between the knee and the ankle, and it
usually affects both legs. it is commonest in girls of delicate
constitution, in whose family history there is evidence of a tuberculous
taint. the patient often presents other lesions of a tuberculous
character, notably enlarged cervical glands, and phlyctenular
ophthalmia. the tubercle bacillus has rarely been found, but we have
always observed characteristic epithelioid cells and giant cells in
sections made from the edge or floor of the ulcer.

[illustration: fig. 16.--bazin's disease in a girl aet. 16.]

the condition begins by the formation in the skin and subcutaneous
tissue of dusky or livid nodules of induration, which soften and
ulcerate, forming small open sores with ragged and undermined edges, not
unlike those resulting from the breaking down of superficial syphilitic
gummata (fig. 16). fresh crops of nodules appear in the neighbourhood of
the ulcers, and in turn break down. while in the nodular stage the
affection is sometimes painful, but with the formation of the ulcer the
pain subsides.

the disease runs a chronic course, and may slowly extend over a wide
area in spite of the usual methods of treatment. after lasting for some
months, or even years, however, it may eventually undergo spontaneous
cure. the most satisfactory treatment is to excise the affected tissues
and fill the gap with skin-grafts.

[illustration: fig. 17.--syphilitic ulcers in region of knee, showing
punched-out appearance and raised indurated edges.]

the _syphilitic ulcer_ is usually formed by the breaking down of a
cutaneous or subcutaneous gumma in the tertiary stage of syphilis. when
the gummatous tissue is first exposed by the destruction of the skin or
mucous membrane covering it, it appears as a tough greyish slough,
compared to "wash leather," which slowly separates and leaves a more or
less circular, deep, punched-out gap which shows a few feeble unhealthy
granulations and small sloughs on its floor. the edges are raised and
indurated; and the discharge is thick, glairy, and peculiarly offensive.
the parts around the ulcer are congested and of a dark brown colour.
there are usually several such ulcers together, and as they tend to heal
at one part while they spread at another, the affected area assumes a
sinuous or serpiginous outline. syphilitic ulcers may be met with in any
part of the body, but are most frequent in the upper part of the leg
(fig. 17), especially around the knee-joint in women, and over the ribs
and sternum. on healing, they usually leave a depressed and adherent
cicatrix.

the _scorbutic ulcer_ occurs in patients suffering from scurvy, and is
characterised by its prominent granulations, which show a marked
tendency to bleed, with the formation of clots, which dry and form a
spongy crust on the surface.

in _gouty_ patients small ulcers which are exceedingly irritable and
painful are liable to occur.

_ulcers associated with malignant disease._--cancer and sarcoma when
situated in the subcutaneous tissue may destroy the overlying skin so
that the substance of the tumour is exposed. the fungating masses thus
produced are sometimes spoken of as malignant ulcers, but as they are
essentially different in their nature from all other forms of ulcers,
and call for totally different treatment, it is best to consider them
along with the tumours with which they are associated. rodent ulcer,
which is one form of cancer of the skin, will be discussed with new
growths of the skin.

b. #arrangement of ulcers according to their condition.#--having arrived
at an opinion as to the cause of a given ulcer, and placed it in one or
other of the preceding groups, the next question to ask is, in what
condition do i find this ulcer at the present moment?

any ulcer is in one of three states--healing, stationary, or spreading;
although it is not uncommon to find healing going on at one part while
the destructive process is extending at another.

_the healing condition._--the process of healing in an ulcer has already
been studied, and we have learned that it takes place by the formation
of granulation tissue, which becomes converted into connective tissue,
and is covered over by epithelium growing in from the edges.

those ulcers which are _stationary_--that is, neither healing nor
spreading--may be in one of several conditions.

_the weak condition._--any ulcer may get into a weak state from
receiving a blood supply which is defective either in quantity or in
quality. the granulations are small and smooth, and of a pale yellow or
grey colour, the discharge is small in amount, and consists of thin
serum and a few pus cells, and as this dries on the edges it forms scabs
which interfere with the growth of epithelium.

should the part become oedematous, either from general causes, such as
heart or kidney disease, or from local causes, such as varicose veins,
the granulations share in the oedema, and there is an abundant serous
discharge.

the excessive use of moist dressings leads to a third variety of weak
ulcer--namely, one in which the granulations become large, soft, pale,
and flabby, projecting beyond the level of the skin and overlapping the
edges, which become pale and sodden. the term "proud flesh" is popularly
applied to such redundant granulations.

[illustration: fig. 18.--callous ulcer, showing thickened edges and
indurated swelling of surrounding parts.]

_the callous condition._--this condition is usually met with in ulcers
on the lower third of the leg, and is often associated with the presence
of varicose veins. it is chiefly met with in hospital practice. the want
of healing is mainly due to impeded venous return and to oedema and
induration of the surrounding skin and cellular tissues (fig. 18). the
induration results from coagulation and partial organisation of the
inflammatory effusion, and prevents the necessary contraction of the
sore. the base of a callous ulcer lies at some distance below the level
of the swollen, thickened, and white edges, and presents a glazed
appearance, such granulations as are present being unhealthy and
irregular. the discharge is usually watery, and cakes in the dressing.
when from neglect and want of cleanliness the ulcer becomes inflamed,
there is considerable pain, and the discharge is purulent and often
offensive.

the prolonged hyperaemia of the tissues in relation to a callous ulcer of
the leg often leads to changes in the underlying bones. the periosteum
is abnormally thick and vascular, the superficial layers of the bone
become injected and porous, and the bones, as a whole, are thickened. in
the macerated bone "the surface is covered with irregular,
stalactite-like processes or foliaceous masses, which, to a certain
extent, follow the line of attachment of the interosseous membrane and
of the intermuscular septa" (cathcart) (fig. 19). when the whole
thickness of the soft tissues is destroyed by the ulcerative process,
the area of bone that comes to form the base of the ulcer projects as a
flat, porous node, which in its turn may be eroded. these changes as
seen in the macerated specimen are often mistaken for disease
originating in the bone.

[illustration: fig. 19.--tibia and fibula, showing changes due to
chronic ulcer of leg.]

the _irritable condition_ is met with in ulcers which occur, as a rule,
just above the external malleolus in women of neurotic temperament. they
are small in size and have prominent granulations, and by the aid of a
probe points of excessive tenderness may be discovered. these, hilton
believed, correspond to exposed nerve filaments.

_ulcers which are spreading_ may be met with in one of several
conditions.

_the inflamed condition._--any ulcer may become acutely inflamed from
the access of fresh organisms, aided by mechanical irritation from
trauma, ill-fitting splints or bandages, or want of rest, or from
chemical irritants, such as strong antiseptics. the best clinical
example of an inflamed ulcer is the venereal soft sore. the base of the
ulcer becomes red and angry-looking, the granulations disappear, and a
copious discharge of thin yellow pus, mixed with blood, escapes. sloughs
of granulation tissue or of connective tissue may form. the edges become
red, ragged, and everted, and the ulcer increases in size by spreading
into the inflamed and oedematous surrounding tissues. such ulcers are
frequently multiple. pain is a constant symptom, and is often severe,
and there is usually some constitutional disturbance.

the _phagedaenic condition_ is the result of an ulcer being infected with
specially virulent bacteria. it occurs in syphilitic ulcers, and rapidly
leads to a widespread destruction of tissue. it is also met with in the
throat in some cases of scarlet fever, and may give rise to fatal
haemorrhage by ulcerating into large blood vessels. all the local and
constitutional signs of a severe septic infection are present.

#treatment of ulcers.#--an ulcer is not only an immediate cause of
suffering to the patient, crippling and incapacitating him for his work,
but is a distinct and constant menace to his health: the prolonged
discharge reduces his strength; the open sore is a possible source of
infection by the organisms of suppuration, erysipelas, or other specific
diseases; phlebitis, with formation of septic emboli, leading to pyaemia,
is liable to occur; and in old persons it is not uncommon for ulcers of
long standing to become the seat of cancer. in addition, the offensive
odour of many ulcers renders the patient a source of annoyance and
discomfort to others. the primary object of treatment in any ulcer is to
bring it into the condition of a healing sore. when this has been
effected, nature will do the rest, provided extraneous sources of
irritation are excluded.

steps must be taken to facilitate the venous return from the ulcerated
part, and to ensure that a sufficient supply of fresh, healthy blood
reaches it. the septic element must be eliminated by disinfecting the
ulcer and its surroundings, and any other sources of irritation must be
removed.

if the patient's health is below par, good nourishing food, tonics, and
general hygienic treatment are indicated.

_management of a healing sore._--perhaps the best dressing for a healing
sore is a layer of lister's perforated oiled-silk protective, which is
made to cover the raw surface and the skin for about a quarter of an
inch beyond the margins of the sore. over this three or four thicknesses
of sterilised gauze, wrung out of eusol, creolin, or sterilised water,
are applied, and covered by a pad of absorbent wool. as far as possible
the part should be kept at rest, and the position should be adjusted so
as to favour the circulation in the affected area.

the dressing may be renewed at intervals, and care must be taken to
avoid any rough handling of the sore. any discharge that lies on the
surface should be removed by a gentle stream of lotion rather than by
wiping. the area round the sore should be cleansed before the fresh
dressing is applied.

in some cases, healing goes on more rapidly under a dressing of weak
boracic ointment (one-quarter the strength of the pharmacopoeial
preparation). the growth of epithelium may be stimulated by a 6 to 8 per
cent. ointment of scarlet-red.

dusting powders and poultice dressings are best avoided in the treatment
of healing sores.

in extensive ulcers resulting from recent burns, if the granulations are
healthy and aseptic, skin-grafts may safely be placed on them directly.
if, however, their asepticity cannot be relied upon, it is necessary to
scrape away the superficial layer of the granulations, the young fibrous
tissue underneath being conserved, as it is sufficiently vascular to
nourish the grafts placed on it.

#treatment of special varieties of ulcers.#--before beginning to treat a
given ulcer, two questions have to be answered--first, what are the
causative conditions present? and second, in what condition do i find
the ulcer?--in other words, in what particulars does it differ from a
healthy healing sore?

if the cause is a local one, it must be removed; if a constitutional
one, means must be taken to counteract it. this done, the condition of
the ulcer must be so modified as to bring it into the state of a healing
sore, after which it will be managed on the lines already laid down.

#treatment in relation to the cause of the ulcer.#--_traumatic
group._--the _prophylaxis_ of these ulcers consists in excluding
bacteria, by cleansing crushed or bruised parts, and applying sterilised
dressings and properly adjusted splints. if there is reason to fear that
the disinfection has not been complete, a bier's constricting bandage
should be applied for some hours each day. these measures will often
prevent a grossly injured portion of skin dying, and will ensure
asepticity should it do so. in the event of the skin giving way, the
same form of dressing should be continued till the slough has separated
and a healthy granulating surface is formed. the protective dressing
appropriate to a healing sore is then substituted. _pressure sores_ are
treated on the same lines.

the treatment of ulcers caused by _burns and scalds_ will be described
later.

in _ulcers of the leg due to interference with the venous return_, the
primary indication is to elevate the limb in order to facilitate the
flow of the blood in the veins, and so admit of fresh blood reaching the
part. the limb may be placed on pillows, or the foot of the bed raised
on blocks, so that the ulcer lies on a higher level than the heart.
should varicose veins be present, the question of operative treatment
must be considered.

when an _imperfect nerve supply_ is the main factor underlying ulcer
formation, prophylaxis is the chief consideration. in patients suffering
from spinal injuries or diseases, cerebral paralysis, or affections of
the peripheral nerves, all sources of irritation, such as ill-fitting
splints, tight bandages, moist applications, and hot bottles, should be
avoided. any part liable to pressure, from the position of the patient
or otherwise, must be carefully protected by pads of wool, air-cushions,
or water-bags, and must be kept absolutely dry. the skin should be
hardened by daily applications of methylated spirit.

should an ulcer form in spite of these precautions, the mildest
antiseptics must be employed for bathing and dressing it, and as far as
possible all dressings should be dry.

the _perforating ulcer_ of the foot calls for special treatment. to
avoid pressure on the sole of the foot, the patient must be confined to
bed. as the main local obstacle to healing is the down-growth of
epithelium along the sides of the ulcer, this must be removed by the
knife or sharp spoon. the base also should be excised, and any bone
which may have become involved should be gouged away, so as to leave a
healthy and vascular surface. the cavity thus formed is stuffed with
bismuth or iodoform gauze and encouraged to heal from the bottom. as the
parts are insensitive an anaesthetic is not required. after the ulcer has
healed, the patient should wear in his boot a thick felt sole with a
hole cut out opposite the situation of the cicatrix. when a joint has
been opened into, the difficulty of thoroughly getting rid of all
unhealthy and infected granulations is so great that amputation may be
advisable, but it is to be remembered that ulceration may recur in the
stump if pressure is put upon it. the treatment of any nervous disease
or glycosuria which may coexist is, of course, indicated.

exposure of the plantar nerves by an incision behind the medial
malleolus, and subjecting them to forcible stretching, has been employed
by chipault and others in the treatment of perforating ulcers of the
foot.

the ulcer that forms in relation to callosities on the sole of the foot
is treated by paring away all the thickened skin, after softening it
with soda fomentations, removing the unhealthy granulations, and
applying stimulating dressings.

_treatment of ulcers due to constitutional causes._--when ulcers are
associated with such diseases as tuberculosis, syphilis, diabetes,
bright's disease, scurvy, or gout, these must receive appropriate
treatment.

the local treatment of the _tuberculous ulcer_ calls for special
mention. if the ulcer is of limited extent and situated on an exposed
part of the body, the most satisfactory method is complete removal, by
means of the knife, scissors, or sharp spoon, of the ulcerated surface
and of all the infected area around it, so as to leave a healthy surface
from which granulations may spring up. should the raw surface left be
likely to result in an unsightly scar or in cicatricial contraction,
skin-grafting should be employed.

for extensive ulcers on the limbs, the chest wall, or on other covered
parts, or when operative treatment is contra-indicated, the use of
tuberculin and exposure to the rontgen rays have proved beneficial. the
induction of passive hyperaemia, by bier's or by klapp's apparatus,
should also be used, either alone or supplementary to other measures.

no ulcerative process responds so readily to medicinal treatment as the
_syphilitic ulcer_ does to the intra-venous administration of arsenical
preparations of the "606" or "914" groups or to full doses of iodide of
potassium and mercury, and the local application of black wash. when the
ulceration has lasted for a long time, however, and is widespread and
deep, the duration of treatment is materially shortened by a thorough
scraping with the sharp spoon.

#treatment in relation to the condition of the ulcer.#--_ulcers in a
weak condition._--if the weak condition of the ulcer is due to anaemia
or kidney disease, these affections must first be treated. locally, the
imperfect granulations should be scraped away, and some stimulating
agent applied to the raw surface to promote the growth of healthy
granulations. for this purpose the sore may be covered with gauze
smeared with a 6 to 8 per cent. ointment of scarlet-red, the surrounding
parts being protected from the irritant action of the scarlet-red by a
layer of vaseline. a dressing of gauze moistened with eusol or of
boracic lint wrung out of red lotion (2 grains of sulphate of zinc, and
10 minims of compound tincture of lavender, to an ounce of water), and
covered with a layer of gutta-percha tissue, is also useful.

when the condition has resulted from the prolonged use of moist
dressings, these must be stopped, the redundant granulations clipped
away with scissors, the surface rubbed with silver nitrate or sulphate
of copper (blue-stone), and dry dressings applied.

when the ulcer has assumed the characters of a healing sore, skin-grafts
may be applied to hasten cicatrisation.

_ulcers in a callous condition_ call for treatment in three
directions--(1) the infective element must be eliminated. when the ulcer
is foul, relays of charcoal poultices (three parts of linseed meal to
one of charcoal), maintained for thirty-six to forty-eight hours, are
useful as a preliminary step. the base of the ulcer and the thickened
edges should then be freely scraped with a sharp spoon, and the
resulting raw surface sponged over with undiluted carbolic acid or
iodine, after which an antiseptic dressing is applied, and changed daily
till healthy granulations appear. (2) the venous return must be
facilitated by elevation of the limb and massage. (3) the induration of
the surrounding parts must be got rid of before contraction of the sore
is possible. for this purpose the free application of blisters, as first
recommended by syme, leaves little to be desired. liquor epispasticus
painted over the parts, or a large fly-blister (emplastrum cantharidis)
applied all round the ulcer, speedily disperses the inflammatory
products which cause the induration. the use of elastic pressure or of
strapping, of hot-air baths, or the making of multiple incisions in the
skin around the ulcer, fulfils the same object.

as soon as the ulcer assumes the characters of a healing sore, it should
be covered with skin-grafts, which furnish a much better cicatrix than
that which forms when the ulcer is allowed to heal without such aid.

a more radical method of treatment consists in excising the whole
ulcer, including its edges and about a quarter of an inch of the
surrounding tissue, as well as the underlying fibrous tissue, and
grafting the raw surface.

_ambulatory treatment._--when the circumstances of the patient forbid
his lying up in bed, the healing of the ulcer is much delayed. he should
be instructed to take every possible opportunity of placing the limb in
an elevated position, and must constantly wear a firm bandage of
_elastic webbing_. this webbing is porous and admits of evaporation of
the skin and wound secretions--an advantage it has over martin's rubber
bandage. the bandage should extend from the toes to well above the knee,
and should always be applied while the patient is in the recumbent
position with the leg elevated, preferably before getting out of bed in
the morning. additional support is given to the veins if the bandage is
applied as a figure of eight.

we have found the following method satisfactory in out-patient
practice. the patient lying on a couch, the limb is raised about
eighteen inches and kept in this position for five minutes--till the
excess of blood has left it. with the limb still raised, the ulcer with
the surrounding skin is covered with a layer, about half an inch thick,
of finely powdered boracic acid, and the leg, from foot to knee,
excluding the sole, is enveloped in a thick layer of wood-wool wadding.
this is held in position by ordinary cotton bandages, painted over with
liquid starch; while the starch is drying the limb is kept elevated.
with this appliance the patient may continue to work, and the dressing
does not require to be changed oftener than once in three or four weeks
(w. g. richardson).

when an ulcer becomes acutely _inflamed_ as a result of superadded
infection, antiseptic measures are employed to overcome the infection,
and ichthyol or other soothing applications may be used to allay the
pain.

the _phagedaenic ulcer_ calls for more energetic means of disinfection;
the whole of the affected surface is touched with the actual cautery at
a white heat, or is painted with pure carbolic acid. relays of charcoal
poultices are then applied until the spread of the disease is arrested.

for the _irritable ulcer_ the most satisfactory treatment is complete
excision and subsequent skin-grafting.

gangrene or mortification is the process by which a portion of tissue
dies _en masse_, as distinguished from the molecular or cellular death
which constitutes ulceration. the dead portion is known as a _slough_.

in this chapter we shall confine our attention to the process as it
affects the limbs and superficial parts, leaving gangrene of the viscera
to be described in regional surgery.


types of gangrene

two distinct types of gangrene are met with, which, from their most
obvious point of difference, are known respectively as _dry_ and
_moist_, and there are several clinical varieties of each type.

speaking generally, it may be said that dry gangrene is essentially due
to a simple _interference with the blood supply_ of a part; while the
main factor in the production of moist gangrene is _bacterial
infection_.

the cardinal signs of gangrene are: change in the colour of the part,
coldness, loss of sensation and motor power, and, lastly, loss of
pulsation in the arteries.

#dry gangrene# or #mummification# is a comparatively slow form of local
death due, as a rule, to a diminution in the arterial blood supply of
the affected part, resulting from such causes as the gradual narrowing
of the lumen of the arteries by disease of their coats, or the blocking
of the main vessel by an embolus.

as the fluids in the tissues are lost by evaporation the part becomes
dry and shrivelled, and as the skin is usually intact, infection does
not take place, or if it does, the want of moisture renders the part an
unsuitable soil, and the organisms do not readily find a footing. any
spread of the process that may take place is chiefly influenced by the
anatomical distribution of the blocked arteries, and is arrested as soon
as it reaches an area rich in anastomotic vessels. the dead portion is
then cast off, the irritation resulting from the contact of the dead
with the still living tissue inducing the formation of granulations on
the proximal side of the junction, and these by slowly eating into the
dead portion produce a furrow--the _line of demarcation_--which
gradually deepens until complete separation is effected. as the muscles
and bones have a richer blood supply than the integument, the death of
skin and subcutaneous tissues extends higher than that of muscles and
bone, with the result that the stump left after spontaneous separation
is conical, the end of the bone projecting beyond the soft parts.

_clinical features._--the part undergoing mortification becomes colder
than normal, the temperature falling to that of the surrounding
atmosphere. in many instances, but not in all, the onset of the process
is accompanied by severe neuralgic pain in the part, probably due to
anaemia of the nerves, to neuritis, or to the irritation of the exposed
axis cylinders by the dead and dying tissues around them. this pain soon
ceases and gives place to a complete loss of sensation. the dead part
becomes dry, horny, shrivelled, and semi-transparent--at first of a dark
brown, but finally of a black colour, from the dissemination of blood
pigment throughout the tissues. there is no putrefaction, and therefore
no putrid odour; and the condition being non-infective, there is not
necessarily any constitutional disturbance. in itself, therefore, dry
gangrene does not involve immediate risk to life; the danger lies in the
fact that the breach of surface at the line of demarcation furnishes a
possible means of entrance for bacteria, which may lead to infective
complications.

#moist gangrene# is an acute process, the dead part retaining its fluids
and so affording a favourable soil for the development of bacteria. the
action of the organisms and their toxins on the adjacent tissues leads
to a rapid and wide spread of the process. the skin becomes moist and
macerated, and bullae, containing dark-coloured fluid or gases, form
under the epidermis. the putrefactive gases evolved cause the skin to
become emphysematous and crepitant and produce an offensive odour. the
tissues assume a greenish-black colour from the formation in them of a
sulphide of iron resulting from decomposition of the blood pigment.
under certain conditions the dead part may undergo changes resembling
more closely those of ordinary post-mortem decomposition. owing to its
nature the spread of the gangrene is seldom arrested by the natural
protective processes, and it usually continues until the condition
proves fatal from the absorption of toxins into the circulation.

the _clinical features_ vary in the different varieties of moist
gangrene, but the local results of bacterial action and the
constitutional disturbance associated with toxin absorption are present
in all; the prognosis therefore is grave in the extreme.

from what has been said, it will be gathered that in dry gangrene there
is no urgent call for operation to save the patient's life, the primary
indication being to prevent the access of bacteria to the dead part, and
especially to the surface exposed at the line of demarcation. in moist
gangrene, on the contrary, organisms having already obtained a footing,
immediate removal of the dead and dying tissues, as a rule, offers the
only hope of saving life.


varieties of gangrene

#varieties of gangrene essentially due to interference with the
circulation#

while the varieties of gangrene included in this group depend primarily
on interference with the circulation, it is to be borne in mind that the
clinical course of the affection may be profoundly influenced by
superadded infection with micro-organisms. although the bacteria do not
play the most important part in producing tissue necrosis, their

subsequent introduction is an accident of such importance that it may
change the whole aspect of affairs and convert a dry form of gangrene
into one of the moist type. moreover, the low state of vitality of the
tissues, and the extreme difficulty of securing and maintaining asepsis,
make it a sequel of great frequency.

#senile gangrene.#--senile gangrene is the commonest example of local
death produced by a _gradual_ diminution in the quantity of blood
passing through the parts, as a result of arterio-sclerosis or other
chronic disease of the arteries leading to diminution of their calibre.
it is the most characteristic example of the dry type of gangrene. as
the term indicates, it occurs in old persons, but the patient's age is
to be reckoned by the condition of his arteries rather than by the
number of his years. thus the vessels of a comparatively young man who
has suffered from syphilis and been addicted to alcohol are more liable
to atheromatous degeneration leading to this form of gangrene than are
those of a much older man who has lived a regular and abstemious life.
this form of gangrene is much more common in men than in women. while it
usually attacks only one foot, it is not uncommon for the other foot to
be affected after an interval, and in some cases it is bilateral from
the outset. it must clearly be understood that any form of gangrene may

occur in old persons, the term senile being here restricted to that
variety which results from arterio-sclerosis.

[illustration: fig. 20.--senile gangrene of the foot, showing line of
demarcation.]

_clinical features._--the commonest seat of the disease is in the toes,
especially the great toe, whence it spreads up the foot to the heel, or
even to the leg (fig. 20). there is often a history of some slight
injury preceding its onset. the vitality of the tissues is so low that
the balance between life and death may be turned by the most trivial
injury, such as a cut while paring a toe-nail or a corn, a blister
caused by an ill-fitting shoe or the contact of a hot-bottle. in some
cases the actual gangrene is determined by thrombosis of the popliteal
or tibial arteries, which are already narrowed by obliterating
endarteritis.

it is common to find that the patient has been troubled for a long time
before the onset of definite signs of gangrene, with cold feet, with
tingling and loss of feeling, or a peculiar sensation as if walking on
cotton wool.

the first evidence of the death of the part varies in different cases.
sometimes a dark-blue spot appears on the medial side of the great toe
and gradually increases in size; or a blister containing blood-stained
fluid may form. streaks or patches of dark-blue mottling appear higher
up on the foot or leg. in other cases a small sore surrounded by a
congested areola forms in relation to the nail and refuses to heal. such
sores on the toes of old persons are always to be looked upon with
suspicion and treated with the greatest care; and the urine should be
examined for sugar. there is often severe, deep-seated pain of a
neuralgic character, with cramps in the limb, and these may persist long
after a line of demarcation has formed. the dying part loses sensibility
to touch and becomes cold and shrivelled.

all the physical appearances and clinical symptoms associated with dry
gangrene supervene, and the dead portion is delimited by a line of
demarcation. if this forms slowly and irregularly it indicates a very
unsatisfactory condition of the circulation; while, if it forms quickly
and decidedly, the presumption is that the circulation in the parts
above is fairly good. the separation of the dead part is always attended
with the risk of infection taking place, and should this occur, the
temperature rises and other evidences of toxaemia appear.

_prophylaxis._--the toes and feet of old people, the condition of whose
circulation predisposes them to gangrene, should be protected from
slight injuries such as may be received while paring nails, cutting
corns, or wearing ill-fitting boots. the patient should also be warned
of the risk of exposure to cold, the use of hot-bottles, and of placing
the feet near a fire. attempts have been made to improve the peripheral
circulation by establishing an anastomosis between the main artery of a
limb and its companion vein, so that arterial blood may reach the
peripheral capillaries--reversal of the circulation--but the clinical
results have proved disappointing. (see _op. surg._, p. 29.)

_treatment._--when there is evidence that gangrene has occurred, the
first indication is to prevent infection by purifying the part, and
after careful drying to wrap it in a thick layer of absorbent and
antiseptic wool, retained in place by a loosely applied bandage. a
slight degree of elevation of the limb is an advantage, but it must not
be sufficient to diminish the amount of blood entering the part.
hot-bottles are to be used with the utmost caution. as absolute dryness
is essential, ointments or other greasy dressings are to be avoided, as
they tend to prevent evaporation from the skin. opium should be given
freely to alleviate pain. stimulation is to be avoided, and the patient
should be carefully dieted.

when the gangrene is limited to the toes in old and feeble patients,
some surgeons advocate the expectant method of treatment, waiting for a
line of demarcation to form and allowing the dead part to be separated.
this takes place so slowly, however, that it necessitates the patient
being laid up for many weeks, or even months; and we agree with the
majority in advising early amputation.

in this connection it is worthy of note that there are certain points at
which gangrene naturally tends to become arrested--namely, at the highly
vascular areas in the neighbourhood of joints. thus gangrene of the
great toe often stops when it reaches the metatarso-phalangeal joint; or
if it trespasses this limit it may be arrested either at the
tarso-metatarsal or at the ankle joint. if these be passed, it usually
spreads up the leg to just below the knee before signs of arrestment
appear. further, it is seen from pathological specimens that the spread
is greater on the dorsal than on the plantar aspect, and that the death
of skin and subcutaneous tissues extends higher than that of bone and
muscle.

these facts furnish us with indications as to the seat and method of
amputation. experience has proved that in senile gangrene of the lower
extremity the most reliable and satisfactory results are obtained by
amputating in the region of the knee, care being taken to perform the
operation so as to leave the prepatellar anastomosis intact by retaining
the patella in the anterior flap. the most satisfactory operation in
these cases is gritti's supra-condylar amputation. haemorrhage is easily
controlled by digital pressure, and the use of a tourniquet should be
dispensed with, as the constriction of the limb is liable to interfere
with the vitality of the flaps.

when the tibial vessels can be felt pulsating at the ankle it may be
justifiable, if the patient urgently desires it, to amputate lower than
the knee; but there is considerable risk of gangrene recurring in the
stump and necessitating a second operation.

that amputation for senile gangrene performed between the ankle and the
knee seldom succeeds, is explained by the fact that the vascular
obstruction is usually in the upper part of the posterior tibial artery,
and the operation is therefore performed through tissues with an
inadequate blood supply. it is not uncommon, indeed, on amputating above
the knee, to find even the popliteal artery plugged by a clot. this
should be removed at the amputation by squeezing the vessel from above
downward by a "milking" movement, or by "catheterising the artery" with
the aid of a cannula with a terminal aperture.

it is to be borne in mind that the object of amputation in these cases
is merely to remove the gangrenous part, and so relieve the patient of
the discomfort and the risks from infection which its presence involves.
while it is true that in many of these patients the operation is borne
remarkably well, it must be borne in mind that those who suffer from
senile gangrene are of necessity bad lives, and a guarded opinion should
be expressed as to the prospects of survival. the possibility of the
disease developing in the other limb has already been referred to.

[illustration: fig. 21.--embolic gangrene of hand and arm.]

#embolic gangrene# (fig. 21).--this is the most typical form of gangrene
resulting from the _sudden_ occlusion of the main artery of a part,
whether by the impaction of an embolus or the formation of a thrombus in
its lumen, when the collateral circulation is not sufficiently free to
maintain the vitality of the tissues.

there is sudden pain at the site of impaction of the embolus, and the
pulses beyond are lost. the limb becomes cold, numb, insensitive, and
powerless. it is often pale at first--hence the term "white gangrene"
sometimes applicable to the early appearances, which closely resemble
those presented by the limb of a corpse.

if the part is aseptic it shrivels, and presents the ordinary features
of dry gangrene. it is liable, however, especially in the lower
extremity and when the veins also are obstructed, to become infected and
to assume the characters of the moist type.

the extent of the gangrene depends upon the site of impaction of the
embolus, thus if the _abdominal aorta_ becomes suddenly occluded by an
embolus at its bifurcation, the obstruction of the iliacs and femorals
induces symmetrical gangrene of both extremities as high as the inguinal
ligaments. when gangrene follows occlusion of the _external iliac_ or of
the _femoral artery_ above the origin of its deep branch, the death of
the limb extends as high as the middle or upper third of the thigh. when
the _femoral_ below the origin of its deep branch or the _popliteal
artery_ is obstructed, the veins remaining pervious, the anastomosis
through the profunda is sufficient to maintain the vascular supply, and
gangrene does not necessarily follow. the rupture of a popliteal
aneurysm, however, by compressing the vein and the articular branches,
usually determines gangrene. when an embolus becomes impacted at the
_bifurcation of the popliteal_, if gangrene ensues it usually spreads
well up the leg.

when the _axillary artery_ is the seat of embolic impaction, and
gangrene ensues, the process usually reaches the middle of the upper
arm. gangrene following the blocking of the _brachial_ at its
bifurcation usually extends as far as the junction of the lower and
middle thirds of the forearm.

gangrene due to thrombosis or embolism is sometimes met with in patients
recovering from typhus, typhoid, or other fevers, such as that
associated with child-bed. it occurs in peripheral parts, such as the
toes, fingers, nose, or ears.

_treatment._--the general treatment of embolic gangrene is the same as
that for the senile form. success has followed opening the artery and
removing the embolus. the artery is exposed at the seat of impaction
and, having been clamped above and below, a longitudinal opening is made
and the clot carefully extracted with the aid of forceps; it is
sometimes unexpectedly long (one recorded from the femoral artery
measured nearly 34 inches); the wound in the artery is then sewn up with
fine silk soaked in paraffin. when amputation is indicated, it must be
performed sufficiently high to ensure a free vascular supply to the
flaps.

#gangrene following ligation of arteries.#--after the ligation of an
artery in its continuity--for example, in the treatment of aneurysm--the
limb may for some days remain in a condition verging on gangrene, the
distal parts being cold, devoid of sensation, and powerless. as the
collateral circulation is established, the vitality of the tissues is
gradually restored and these symptoms pass off. in some cases,
however,--and especially in the lower extremity--gangrene ensues and
presents the same characters as those resulting from embolism. it tends
to be of the dry type. the occlusion of the vein as well as the artery
is not found to increase the risk of gangrene.

#gangrene from mechanical constriction of the vessels of the part.#--the
application of a bandage or plaster-of-paris case too tightly, or of a
tourniquet for too long a time, has been known to lead to death of the
part beyond; but such cases are rare, as are also those due to the
pressure of a fractured bone or of a tumour on a large artery or vein.
when gangrene occurs from such causes, it tends to be of the moist type.

much commoner is it to meet with localised areas of necrosis due to the
excessive _pressure of splints_ over bony prominences, such as the
lateral malleolus, the medial condyle of the humerus, or femur, or over
the dorsum of the foot. this is especially liable to occur when the
nutrition of the skin is depressed by any interference with its
nerve-supply, such as follows injuries to the spine or peripheral
nerves, disease of the brain, or acute anterior poliomyelitis. when the
splint is removed the skin pressed upon is found to be of a pale yellow
or grey colour, and is surrounded by a ring of hyperaemia. if protected
from infection, the clinical course is that of dry gangrene.

bed-sores, which are closely allied to pressure sores, will be described
at the end of this chapter.

when a localised portion of tissue, for example, a piece of skin, is so
severely _crushed_ or _bruised_ that its blood vessels are occluded and
its structure destroyed, it dies, and, if not infected with bacteria,
dries up, and the shrivelled brown skin is slowly separated by the
growth of granulation tissue beneath and around it.

fingers, toes, or even considerable portions of limbs may in the same
way be suddenly destroyed by severe trauma, and undergo mummification.
if organisms gain access, typical moist gangrene may ensue, or changes
similar to those of ordinary post-mortem decomposition may take place.

_treatment._--the first indication is to exclude bacteria by purifying
the damaged part and its surroundings, and applying dry, non-irritating
dressings.

when these measures are successful, dry gangrene ensues. the raw surface
left after the separation of the dead skin may be allowed to heal by
granulation, or may be covered by skin-grafts. in the case of a finger
or a limb it is not necessary to wait until spontaneous separation takes
place, as this is often a slow process. when a well-marked line of
demarcation has formed, amputation may be performed just sufficiently
far above it to enable suitable flaps to be made.

the end of a stump, after spontaneous separation of the gangrenous
portion, requires to be trimmed, sufficient bone being removed to permit
of the soft parts coming together.

if moist gangrene supervenes, amputation must be performed without
delay, and at a higher level.

#gangrene from heat, chemical agents, and cold.#--severe #burns# and
#scalds# may be followed by necrosis of tissue. so long as the parts are
kept absolutely dry--as, for example, by the picric acid method of
treatment--the grossly damaged portions of tissue undergo dry gangrene;
but when wet or oily dressings are applied and organisms gain access,
moist gangrene follows.

strong #chemical agents#, such as caustic potash, nitric or sulphuric
acid, may also induce local tissue necrosis, the general appearances of
the lesions produced being like those of severe burns. the resulting
sloughs are slow to separate, and leave deep punched-out cavities which
are long of healing.

#carbolic gangrene.#--carbolic acid, even in comparatively weak
solution, is liable to induce dry gangrene when applied as a fomentation
to a finger, especially in women and children. thrombosis occurs in the
blood vessels of the part, which at first is pale and soft, but later
becomes dark and leathery. on account of the anaesthetic action of
carbolic acid, the onset of the process is painless, and the patient
does not realise his danger. a line of demarcation soon forms, but the
dead part separates very slowly.

#gangrene from frost-bite.#--it is difficult to draw the line between
the third degree of chilblain and the milder forms of true frost-bite;
the difference is merely one of degree. frost-bite affects chiefly the
toes and fingers--especially the great toe and the little finger--the
ears, and the nose. in this country it is seldom seen except in members
of the tramp class, who, in addition to being exposed to cold by
sleeping in the open air, are ill-fed and generally debilitated. the
condition usually manifests itself after the parts, having been
subjected to extreme cold, are brought into warm surroundings. the first
symptom is numbness in the part, followed by a sense of weight,
tingling, and finally by complete loss of sensation. the part attacked
becomes white and bleached-looking, feels icy cold, and is insensitive
to touch. either immediately, or, it may be, not for several days, it
becomes discoloured and swollen, and finally contracts and shrivels.
above the dead area the limb may be the seat of excruciating pain. the
dead portion is cast off, as in other forms of dry gangrene, by the
formation of a line of demarcation.

to prevent the occurrence of gangrene from frost-bite it is necessary to
avoid the sudden application of heat. the patient should be placed in a
cold room, and the part rubbed with snow, or put in a cold bath, and
have light friction applied to it. as the circulation is restored the
general surroundings and the local applications are gradually made
warmer. elevation of the part, wrapping it in cotton wool, and removal
to a warmer room, are then permissible, and stimulants and warm drinks
may be given with caution. when by these means the occurrence of
gangrene is averted, recovery ensues, its onset being indicated by the
white parts assuming a livid red hue and becoming the seat of an acute
burning sensation.

a condition known as _trench feet_ was widely prevalent amongst the
troops in france during the european war. although allied to frost-bite,
cold appears to play a less important part in its causation than
humidity and constriction of the limbs producing ischaemia of the feet.
changes were found in the endothelium of the blood vessels, the axis
cylinders of nerves, and the muscles. the condition does not occur in
civil life.

#diabetic gangrene.#--this form of gangrene is prone to occur in persons
over fifty years of age who suffer from glycosuria. the arteries are
often markedly diseased. in some cases the existence of the glycosuria
is unsuspected before the onset of the gangrene, and it is only on
examining the urine that the cause of the condition is discovered. the
gangrenous process seldom begins as suddenly as that associated with
embolism, and, like senile gangrene, which it may closely simulate in
its early stages, it not infrequently begins after a slight injury to
one of the toes. it but rarely, however, assumes the dry, shrivelling
type, as a rule being attended with swelling, oedema, and dusky redness
of the foot, and severe pain. according to paget, the dead part remains
warm longer than in other forms of senile gangrene; there is a greater
tendency for patches of skin at some distance from the primary seat of
disease to become gangrenous, and for the death of tissue to extend
upwards in the subcutaneous planes, leaving the overlying skin
unaffected. the low vitality of the tissues favours the growth of
bacteria, and if these gain access, the gangrene assumes the characters
of the moist type and spreads rapidly.

the rules for amputation are the same as those governing the treatment
of senile gangrene, the level at which the limb is removed depending
upon whether the gangrene is of the dry or moist type. the general
treatment for diabetes must, of course, be employed whether amputation
is performed or not. paget recommended that the dietetic treatment
should not be so rigid as in uncomplicated diabetes, and that opium
should be given freely.

the _prognosis_ even after amputation is unfavourable. in many cases the
patient dies with symptoms of diabetic coma within a few days of the
operation; or, if he survives this, he may eventually succumb to
diabetes. in others there is sloughing of the flaps and death results
from toxaemia. occasionally the other limb becomes gangrenous. on the
other hand, the glycosuria may diminish or may even disappear after
amputation.

#gangrene associated with spasm of blood vessels.#--#raynaud's disease#,
or symmetrical gangrene, is supposed to be due to spasm of the
arterioles, resulting from peripheral neuritis. it occurs oftenest in
women, between the ages of eighteen and thirty, who are the subjects of
uterine disorders, anaemia, or chlorosis. cold is an aggravating factor,
as the disease is commonest during the winter months. the digits of both
hands or the toes of both feet are simultaneously attacked, and the
disease seldom spreads beyond the phalanges or deeper than the skin.

the first evidence is that the fingers become cold, white, and
insensitive to touch and pain. these attacks of _local syncope_ recur at
varying intervals for months or even years. they last for a few minutes
or even for some hours, and as they pass off the parts become hyperaemic
and painful.

a more advanced stage of the disease is known as _local asphyxia_. the
circulation through the fingers becomes exceedingly sluggish, and the
parts assume a dull, livid hue. there is swelling and burning or
shooting pain. this may pass off in a few days, or may increase in
severity, with the formation of bullae, and end in dry gangrene. as a
rule, the slough which forms is comparatively small and superficial,
but it may take some months to separate. the condition tends to recur in
successive winters.

the _treatment_ consists in remedying any nervous or uterine disorder
that may be present, keeping the parts warm by wrapping them in cotton
wool, and in the use of hot-air or electric baths, the parts being
immersed in water through which a constant current is passed. when
gangrene occurs, it is treated on the same lines as other forms of dry
gangrene, but if amputation is called for it is only with a view to
removing the dead part.

#angio-sclerotic gangrene.#--a form of gangrene due to _angio-sclerosis_
is occasionally met with in young persons, even in children. it bears
certain analogies to raynaud's disease in that spasm of the vessels
plays a part in determining the local death.

the main arteries are narrowed by hyperplastic endarteritis followed by
thrombosis, and similar changes are found in the veins. the condition is
usually met with in the feet, but the upper extremity may be affected,
and is attended with very severe pain, rendering sleep impossible.

the patient is liable to sudden attacks of numbness, tingling and
weakness of the limbs which pass off with rest--_intermittent
claudication_. during these attacks the large arteries--femoral,
brachial, and subclavian--can be felt as firm cords, while pulsation is
lost in the peripheral vessels. gangrene eventually ensues, is attended
with great pain and runs a slow course. it is treated on the same lines
as raynaud's disease.

#gangrene from ergot.#--gangrene may occur from interference with blood
supply, the result of tetanic contraction of the minute vessels, such as
results in ill-nourished persons who eat large quantities of coarse rye
bread contaminated with the _claviceps purpurea_ and containing the
ergot of rye. it has also occurred in the fingers of patients who have
taken ergot medicinally over long periods. the gangrene, which attacks
the toes, fingers, ears, or nose, is preceded by formication, numbness,
and pains in the parts to be affected, and is of the dry variety.

in this country it is usually met with in sailors off foreign ships,
whose dietary largely consists of rye bread. trivial injuries may be the
starting-point, the anaesthesia produced by the ergotin preventing the
patient taking notice of them. alcoholism is a potent predisposing
cause.

as it is impossible to predict how far the process will spread, it is
advisable to wait for the formation of a line of demarcation before
operating, and then to amputate immediately above the dead part.


bacterial varieties of gangrene

the acute bacillary forms of gangrene all assume the moist type from the
first, and, spreading rapidly, result in extensive necrosis of tissue,
and often end fatally.

the infection is usually a mixed one in which anaerobic bacteria
predominate. the anaerobe most constantly present is the _bacillus
aerogenes capsulatus_, usually in association with other anaerobes, and
sometimes with pyogenic diplo- and streptococci. according to the mode of
action of the associated organisms and the combined effects of their
toxins on the tissues, the gangrenous process presents different
pathological and clinical features. some combinations, for example,
result in a rapidly spreading cellulitis with early necrosis of
connective tissue accompanied by thrombosis throughout the capillary and
venous circulation of the parts implicated; other combinations cause
great oedema of the part, and others again lead to the formation of gases
in the tissues, particularly in the muscles.

these different effects do not appear to be due to a specific action of
any one of the organisms present, but to the combined effect of a
particular group living in symbiosis.

according as the cellulitic, the oedematous, or the gaseous
characteristics predominate, the clinical varieties of bacillary
gangrene may be separately described, but it must be clearly understood
that they frequently overlap and cannot always be distinguished from one
another.

#clinical varieties of bacillary gangrene.#--#acute infective gangrene#
is the form most commonly met with in civil practice. it may follow such
trivial injuries as a pin-prick or a scratch, the signs of acute
cellulitis rapidly giving place to those of a spreading gangrene. or it
may ensue on a severe railway, machinery, or street accident, when
lacerated and bruised tissues are contaminated with gross dirt. often
within a few hours of the injury the whole part rapidly becomes painful,
swollen, oedematous, and tense. the skin is at first glazed, and perhaps
paler than normal, but soon assumes a dull red or purplish hue, and
bullae form on the surface. putrefactive gases may be evolved in the
tissues, and their presence is indicated by emphysematous crackling when
the part is handled. the spread of the disease is so rapid that its
progress is quite visible from hour to hour, and may be traced by the
occurrence of red lines along the course of the lymphatics of the limb.
in the most acute cases the death of the affected part takes place so
rapidly that the local changes indicative of gangrene have not time to
occur, and the fact that the part is dead may be overlooked.

[illustration: fig. 22.--gangrene of terminal phalanx of index-finger,
following cellulitis of hand resulting from a scratch on the palm of the
hand.]

rigors may occur, but the temperature is not necessarily raised--indeed,
it is sometimes subnormal. the pulse is small, feeble, rapid, and
irregular. unless amputation is promptly performed, death usually
follows within thirty-six or forty-eight hours. even early operation
does not always avert the fatal issue, because the quantity of toxin
absorbed and its extreme virulence are often more than even a robust
subject can outlive.

_treatment._--every effort must be made to purify all such wounds as are
contaminated by earth, street dust, stable refuse, or other forms of
gross dirt. devitalised and contaminated tissue is removed with the
knife or scissors and the wound purified with antiseptics of the
chlorine group or with hydrogen peroxide. if there is a reasonable
prospect that infection has been overcome, the wound may be at once
sutured, but if this is doubtful it is left open and packed or
irrigated.

when acute gangrene has set in no treatment short of amputation is of
any avail, and the sooner this is done, the greater is the hope of
saving the patient. the limb must be amputated well beyond the apparent
limits of the infected area, and stringent precautions must be taken to
avoid discharge from the already gangrenous area reaching the operation
wound. an assistant or nurse, who is to take no other part in the
operation, is told off to carry out the preliminary purification, and to
hold the limb during the operation.

#malignant oedema.#--this form of acute gangrene has been defined as
"a spreading inflammatory oedema attended with emphysema, and ultimately
followed by gangrene of the skin and adjacent parts." the predominant
organism is the _bacillus of malignant oedema_ or _vibrion septique_ of
pasteur, which is found in garden soil, dung, and various putrefying
substances. it is anaerobic, and occurs as long, thick rods with
somewhat rounded ends and several laterally placed flagella. spores,
which have a high power of resistance, form in the centre of the rods,
and bulge out the sides so as to give the organisms a spindle-shaped
outline. other pathogenic organisms are also present and aid the
specific bacillus in its action.

at the bedside it is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish it
from acute infective gangrene. both follow on the same kinds of injury
and run an exceedingly rapid course. in malignant oedema, however, the
incidence of the disease is mainly on the superficial parts, which
become oedematous and emphysematous, and acquire a marbled appearance
with the veins clearly outlined. early disappearance of sensation is a
particularly grave symptom. bullae form on the skin, and the tissues
have "a peculiar heavy but not putrid odour." the constitutional effects
are extremely severe, and death may ensue within a few hours.

#acute emphysematous# or #gas gangrene# was prevalent in certain areas
at various periods during the european war. it follows infection of
lacerated wounds with the _bacillus aerogenes capsulatus_, usually in
combination with other anaerobes, and its main incidence is on the
muscles, which rapidly become infiltrated with gas that spreads
throughout the whole extent of the muscle, disintegrating its fibres and
leading to necrosis. the gangrenous process spreads with appalling
rapidity, the limb becoming enormously swollen, painful, and crepitant
or even tympanitic. patches of coppery or purple colour appear on the
skin, and bullae containing blood-stained serum form on the surface. the
toxaemia is profound, and the face and lips assume a characteristic
cyanosis. the condition is attended with a high mortality. only in the
early stages and when the infection is limited are local measures
successful in arresting the spread; in more severe cases amputation is
the only means of saving life.

#cancrum oris# or #noma#.--this disease is believed to be due to a
specific bacillus, which occurs in long delicate rods, and is chiefly
found at the margin of the gangrenous area. it is prone to attack
unhealthy children from two to five years of age, especially during
their convalescence from such diseases as measles, scarlet fever, or
typhoid, but may attack adults when they are debilitated. it is most
common in the mouth, but sometimes occurs on the vulva. in the mouth it
begins as an ulcerative stomatitis, more especially affecting the gums
or inner aspect of the cheek. the child lies prostrated, and from the
open mouth foul-smelling saliva, streaked with blood, escapes; the face
is of an ashy-grey colour, the lips dark and swollen. on the inner
aspect of the cheek is a deeply ulcerated surface, with sloughy shreds
of dark-brown or black tissue covering its base; the edges are
irregular, firm, and swollen, and the surrounding mucous membrane is
infiltrated and oedematous. in the course of a few hours a dark spot
appears on the outer aspect of the cheek, and rapidly increases in size;
towards the centre it is black, shading off through blue and grey into a
dark-red area which extends over the cheek (fig. 23). the tissue
implicated is at first firm and indurated, but as it loses its vitality
it becomes doughy and sodden. finally a slough forms, and, when it
separates, the cheek is perforated.

meanwhile the process spreads inside the mouth, and the gums, the floor
of the mouth, or even the jaws, may become gangrenous and the teeth fall
out. the constitutional disturbance is severe, the temperature raised,
and the pulse feeble and rapid.

the extremely foetid odour which pervades the room or even the house the
patient occupies, is usually sufficient to suggest the diagnosis of
cancrum oris. the odour must not be mistaken for that due to
decomposition of sordes on the teeth and gums of a debilitated patient.

the _prognosis_ is always grave in the extreme, the main risks being
general toxaemia and septic pneumonia. when recovery takes place there is
serious deformity, and considerable portions of the jaws may be lost by
necrosis.

[illustration: fig. 23.--cancrum oris.

(from a photograph lent by sir george t. beatson.)]

_treatment._--the only satisfactory treatment is thorough removal under
an anaesthetic of all the sloughy tissue, with the surrounding zone in
which the organisms are active. this is most efficiently accomplished by
the knife or scissors, cutting until the tissue bleeds freely, after
which the raw surface is painted with undiluted carbolic acid and
dressed with iodoform gauze. it may be necessary to remove large pieces
of bone when the necrotic process has implicated the jaws. the mouth
must be constantly sprayed with peroxide of hydrogen, and washed out
with a disinfectant and deodorant lotion, such as condy's fluid. the
patient's general condition calls for free stimulation.

the deformity resulting from these necessarily heroic measures is not so
great as might be expected, and can be further diminished by plastic
operations, which should be undertaken before cicatricial contraction
has occurred.


bed-sores

bed-sores are most frequently met with in old and debilitated patients,
or in those whose tissues are devitalised by acute or chronic diseases
associated with stagnation of blood in the peripheral veins. any
interference with the nerve-supply of the skin, whether from injury or
disease of the central nervous system or of the peripheral nerves,
strongly predisposes to the formation of bed-sores. prolonged and
excessive pressure over a bony prominence, especially if the parts be
moist with skin secretions, urine, or wound discharges, determines the
formation of a sore. excoriations, which may develop into true
bed-sores, sometimes form where two skin surfaces remain constantly
apposed, as in the region of the scrotum or labium, under pendulous
mammae, or between fingers or toes confined in a splint.

[illustration: fig. 24.--acute bed-sores over right buttock.]

_clinical features._--two clinical varieties are met with--the acute
and the chronic bed-sore.

the _acute_ bed-sore usually occurs over the sacrum or buttock. it
develops rapidly after spinal injuries and in the course of certain
brain diseases. the part affected becomes red and congested, while the
surrounding parts are oedematous and swollen, blisters form, and the skin
loses its vitality (fig. 24).

in advanced cases of general paralysis of the insane, a peculiar form of
acute bed-sore beginning as a blister, and passing on to the formation
of a black, dry eschar, which slowly separates, occurs on such parts as
the medial side of the knee, the angle of the scapula, and the heel.

the _chronic_ bed-sore begins as a dusky reddish purple patch, which
gradually becomes darker till it is almost black. the parts around are
oedematous, and a blister may form. this bursts and exposes the papillae
of the skin, which are of a greenish hue. a tough greyish-black slough
forms, and is slowly separated. it is not uncommon for the gangrenous
area to continue to spread both in width and in depth till it reaches
the periosteum or bone. bed-sores over the sacrum sometimes implicate
the vertebral canal and lead to spinal meningitis, which usually proves
fatal.

in old and debilitated patients the septic absorption taking place from
a bed-sore often proves a serious complication of other surgical
conditions. from this cause, for example, old people may succumb during
the treatment of a fractured thigh.

the granulating surface left on the separation of the slough tends to
heal comparatively rapidly.

_prevention of bed-sores._--the first essential in the prevention of
bed-sores is the regular changing of the patient's position, so that no
one part of the body is continuously pressed upon for any length of
time. ring-pads of wool, air-cushions, or water-beds are necessary to
remove pressure from prominent parts. absolute dryness of the skin is
all-important. at least once a day, the sacrum, buttocks,
shoulder-blades, heels, elbows, malleoli, or other parts exposed to
pressure, must be sponged with soap and water, thoroughly dried, and
then rubbed with methylated spirit, which is allowed to dry on the skin.
dusting the part with boracic acid powder not only keeps it dry, but
prevents the development of bacteria in the skin secretions.

in operation cases, care must be taken that irritating chemicals used to
purify the skin do not collect under the patient and remain in contact
with the skin of the sacrum and buttocks during the time he is on the
operating-table. there is reason to believe that the so-called
"post-operation bed-sore" may be due to such causes. a similar result
has been known to follow soiling of the sheets by the escape of a
turpentine enema.

_treatment._--once a bed-sore has formed, every effort must be made to
prevent its spread. alcohol is used to cleanse the broken surface, and
dry absorbent dressings are applied and frequently changed. it is
sometimes found necessary to employ moist or oily substances, such as
boracic poultices, eucalyptus ointment, or balsam of peru, to facilitate
the separation of sloughs, or to promote the growth of granulations. in
patients who are not extremely debilitated the slough may be excised,
the raw surface scraped, and then painted with iodine.

skin-grafting is sometimes useful in covering in the large raw surface
left after separation or removal of sloughs.




chapter vii

bacterial and other wound infections


_erysipelas_--_diphtheria_--_tetanus_--_hydrophobia_--_anthrax_--
    _glanders_--_actinomycosis_--_mycetoma_--_delhi
    boil_--_chigoe_--_poisoning by insects_--_snake-bites_.


erysipelas

erysipelas, popularly known as "rose," is an acute spreading infective
disease of the skin or of a mucous membrane due to the action of a
streptococcus. infection invariably takes place through an abrasion of
the surface, although this may be so slight that it escapes observation
even when sought for. the streptococci are found most abundantly in the
lymph spaces just beyond the swollen margin of the inflammatory area,
and in the serous blebs which sometimes form on the surface.

#clinical features.#--_facial erysipelas_ is the commonest clinical
variety, infection usually occurring through some slight abrasion in the
region of the mouth or nose, or from an operation wound in this area.
from this point of origin the inflammation may spread all over the face
and scalp as far back as the nape of the neck. it stops, however, at the
chin, and never extends on to the front of the neck. there is great
oedema of the face, the eyes becoming closed up, and the features
unrecognisable. the inflammation may spread to the meninges, the
intracranial venous sinuses, the eye, or the ear. in some cases the
erysipelas invades the mucous membrane of the mouth, and spreads to the
fauces and larynx, setting up an oedema of the glottis which may prove
dangerous to life.

erysipelas occasionally attacks an operation wound that has become
septic; and it may accompany septic infection of the genital tract in
puerperal women, or the separation of the umbilical cord in infants
(_erysipelas neonatorum_). after an incubation period, which varies from
fifteen to sixty hours, the patient complains of headache, pains in the
back and limbs, loss of appetite, nausea, and frequently there is
vomiting. he has a chill or slight rigor, initiating a rise of
temperature to 103 o, 104 o, or 105 o f.; and a full bounding pulse of
about 100 (fig. 25). the tongue is foul, the breath heavy, and, as a
rule, the bowels are constipated. there is frequently albuminuria, and
occasionally nocturnal delirium. a moderate degree of leucocytosis
(15,000 to 20,000) is usually present.

around the seat of inoculation a diffuse red patch forms, varying in hue
from a bright scarlet to a dull brick-red. the edges are slightly raised
above the level of the surrounding skin, as may readily be recognised by
gently stroking the part from the healthy towards the affected area. the
skin is smooth, tense, and glossy, and presents here and there blisters
filled with serous fluid. the local temperature is raised, and the part
is the seat of a burning sensation and is tender to the touch, the most
tender area being the actively spreading zone which lies about half an
inch beyond the red margin.

[illustration: fig. 25.--chart of erysipelas occurring in a wound.]

the disease tends to spread spasmodically and irregularly, and the
direction and extent of its progress may be recognised by mapping out
the peripheral zone of tenderness. red streaks appear along the lines of
the superficial lymph vessels, and the deep lymphatics may sometimes be
palpated as firm, tender cords. the neighbouring glands, also, are
generally enlarged and tender.

the disease lasts for from two or three days to as many weeks, and
relapses are frequent. spontaneous resolution usually takes place, but
the disease may prove fatal from absorption of toxins, involvement of
the brain or meninges, or from general streptococcal infection.

#complications.#--_diffuse suppurative cellulitis_ is the most serious
local complication, and results from a mixed infection with other
pyogenic bacteria. small _localised superficial abscesses_ may form
during the convalescent stage. they are doubtless due to the action of
skin bacteria, which attack the tissues devitalised by the erysipelas. a
persistent form of _oedema_ sometimes remains after recurrent attacks of
erysipelas, especially when they affect the face or the lower extremity,
a condition which is referred to with elephantiasis.

#treatment.#--the first indication is to endeavour to arrest the spread
of the process. we have found that by painting with linimentum iodi, a
ring half an inch broad, about an inch in front of the peripheral tender
zone--not the red margin--an artificial leucocytosis is produced, and
the advancing streptococci are thereby arrested. several coats of the
iodine are applied, one after the other, and this is repeated daily for
several days, even although the erysipelas has not overstepped the ring.
success depends upon using the liniment of iodine (the tincture is not
strong enough), and in applying it well in front of the disease. to
allay pain the most useful local applications are ichthyol ointment (1
in 6), or lead and opium fomentations.

the general treatment consists in attending to the emunctories, in
administrating quinine in small--two-grain--doses every four hours, or
salicylate of iron (2-5 gr. every three hours), and in giving plenty of
fluid nourishment. it is worthy of note that the anti-streptococcic
serum has proved of less value in the treatment of erysipelas than might
have been expected, probably because the serum is not made from the
proper strain of streptococcus.

it is not necessary to isolate cases of erysipelas, provided the usual
precautions against carrying infection from one patient to another are
rigidly carried out.


diphtheria

diphtheria is an acute infective disease due to the action of a specific
bacterium, the _bacillus diphtheriae_ or _klebs-loffler bacillus_. the
disease is usually transmitted from one patient to another, but it may
be contracted from cats, fowls, or through the milk of infected cows.
cases have occurred in which the surgeon has carried the infection from
one patient to another through neglect of antiseptic precautions. the
incubation period varies from two to seven days.

#clinical features.#--in _pharyngeal diphtheria_, on the first or
second day of the disease, redness and swelling of the mucous membrane
of the pharynx, tonsils, and palate are well marked, and small, circular
greenish or grey patches of false membrane, composed of necrosed
epithelium, fibrin, leucocytes, and red blood corpuscles, begin to
appear. these rapidly increase in area and thickness, till they coalesce
and form a complete covering to the parts. in the pharynx the false
membrane is less adherent to the surface than it is when the disease
affects the air-passages. the diphtheritic process may spread from the
pharynx to the nasal cavities, causing blocking of the nares, with a
profuse ichorous discharge from the nostrils, and sometimes severe
epistaxis. the infection may spread along the nasal duct to the
conjunctiva. the middle ear also may become involved by spread along the
auditory (eustachian) tube.

the lymph glands behind the angle of the jaw enlarge and become tender,
and may suppurate from superadded infection. there is pain on
swallowing, and often earache; and the patient speaks with a nasal
accent. he becomes weak and anaemic, and loses his appetite. there is
often albuminuria. leucocytosis is usually well marked before the
injection of antitoxin; after the injection there is usually a
diminution in the number of leucocytes. the false membrane may separate
and be cast off, after which the patient gradually recovers. death may
take place from gradual failure of the heart's action or from syncope
during some slight exertion.

_laryngeal diphtheria._--the disease may arise in the larynx, although,
as a rule, it spreads thence from the pharynx. it first manifests itself
by a short, dry, croupy cough, and hoarseness of the voice. the first
difficulty in breathing usually takes place during the night, and once
it begins, it rapidly gets worse. inspiration becomes noisy, sometimes
stridulous or metallic or sibilant, and there is marked indrawing of the
epigastrium and lower intercostal spaces. the hoarseness becomes more
marked, the cough more severe, and the patient restless. the difficulty
of breathing occurs in paroxysms, which gradually increase in frequency
and severity, until at length the patient becomes asphyxiated. the
duration of the disease varies from a few hours to four or five days.

after the acute symptoms have passed off, various localised
paralyses may develop, affecting particularly the nerves of the palatal
and orbital muscles, less frequently the lower limbs.

#diagnosis.#--the finding of the klebs-loffler bacillus is the only
conclusive evidence of the disease. the bacillus may be obtained by
swabbing the throat with a piece of aseptic--not antiseptic--cotton wool
or clean linen rag held in a pair of forceps, and rotated so as to
entangle portions of the false membrane or exudate. the swab thus
obtained is placed in a test-tube, previously sterilised by having had
some water boiled in it, and sent to a laboratory for investigation. to
identify the bacillus a piece of the membrane from the swab is rubbed on
a cover glass, dried, and stained with methylene blue or other basic
stain; or cultures may be made on agar or other suitable medium. when a
bacteriological examination is impossible, or when the clinical features
do not coincide with the results obtained, the patient should always be
treated on the assumption that he suffers from diphtheria. so much doubt
exists as to the real nature of membranous croup and its relationship to
true diphtheria, that when the diagnosis between the two is uncertain
the safest plan is to treat the case as one of diphtheria.

in children, diphtheria may occur on the vulva, vagina, prepuce, or
glans penis, and give rise to difficulty in diagnosis, which is only
cleared up by demonstration of the bacillus.

#treatment.#--an attempt may be made to destroy or to counteract the
organisms by swabbing the throat with strong antiseptic solutions, such
as 1 in 1000 corrosive sublimate or 1 in 30 carbolic acid, or by
spraying with peroxide of hydrogen.

the antitoxic serum is our sheet-anchor in the treatment of diphtheria,
and recourse should be had to its use as early as possible.

difficulty of swallowing may be met by the use of a stomach tube passed
either through the mouth or nose. when this is impracticable, nutrient
enemata are called for.

in laryngeal diphtheria, the interference with respiration may call for
intubation of the larynx, or tracheotomy, but the antitoxin treatment
has greatly diminished the number of cases in which it becomes necessary
to have recourse to these measures.

intubation consists in introducing through the mouth into the larynx a
tube which allows the patient to breathe freely during the period while
the membrane is becoming separated and thrown off. this is best done
with the apparatus of o'dwyer; but when this instrument is not
available, a simple gum-elastic catheter with a terminal opening (as
suggested by macewen and annandale) may be employed.

when intubation is impracticable, the operation of tracheotomy is
called for if the patient's life is endangered by embarrassment of
respiration. unless the patient is in hospital with skilled assistance
available, tracheotomy is the safer of the two procedures.


tetanus

tetanus is a disease resulting from infection of a wound by a specific
micro-organism, the _bacillus tetani_, and characterised by increased
reflex excitability, hypertonus, and spasm of one or more groups of
voluntary muscles.

_etiology and morbid anatomy._--the tetanus bacillus, which is a perfect
anaerobe, is widely distributed in nature and can be isolated from
garden earth, dung-heaps, and stable refuse. it is a slender rod-shaped
bacillus, with a single large spore at one end giving it the shape of a
drum-stick (fig. 26). the spores, which are the active agents in
producing tetanus, are highly resistant to chemical agents, retain their
vitality in a dry condition, and even survive boiling for five minutes.

the organism does not readily establish itself in the human body, and
seems to flourish best when it finds a nidus in necrotic tissue and is
accompanied by aerobic organisms, which, by using up the oxygen in the
tissues, provide for it a suitable environment. the presence of a
foreign body in the wound seems to favour its action. the infection is
for all practical purposes a local one, the symptoms of the disease
being due to the toxins produced in the wound of infection acting upon
the central nervous system.

the toxin acts principally on the nerve centres in the spinal medulla,
to which it travels from the focus of infection by way of the nerve
fibres supplying the voluntary muscles. its first effect on the motor
ganglia of the cord is to render them hypersensitive, so that they are
excited by mild stimuli, which under ordinary conditions would produce
no reaction. as the toxin accumulates the reflex arc is affected, with
the result that when a stimulus reaches the ganglia a motor discharge
takes place, which spreads by ascending and descending collaterals to
the reflex apparatus of the whole cord. as the toxin spreads it causes
both motor hyper-tonus and hyper-excitability, which accounts for the
tonic contraction and the clonic spasms characteristic of tetanus.

[illustration: fig. 26.--bacillus of tetanus from scraping of a wound of
finger, x 1000 diam. basic fuchsin stain.]

#clinical varieties of tetanus.#--_acute_ or _fulminating
tetanus_.--this variety is characterised by the shortness of the
incubation period, the rapidity of its progress, the severity of its
symptoms, and its all but universally fatal issue in spite of
treatment, death taking place in from one to four days. the
characteristic symptoms may appear within three or four days of the
infliction of the wound, but the incubation period may extend to three
weeks, and the wound may be quite healed before the disease declares
itself--_delayed tetanus_. usually, however, the wound is inflamed and
suppurating, with ragged and sloughy edges. a slight feverish attack may
mark the onset of the tetanic condition, or the patient may feel
perfectly well until the spasms begin. if careful observations be made,
it may be found that the muscles in the immediate neighbourhood of the
wound are the first to become contracted; but in the majority of
instances the patient's first complaint is of pain and stiffness in the
muscles of mastication, notably the masseter, so that he has difficulty
in opening the mouth--hence the popular name "lock-jaw." the muscles of
expression soon share in the rigidity, and the face assumes a taut,
mask-like aspect. the angles of the mouth may be retracted, producing a
grinning expression known as the _risus sardonicus_.

the next muscles to become stiff and painful are those of the neck,
especially the sterno-mastoid and trapezius. the patient is inclined to
attribute the pain and stiffness to exposure to cold or rheumatism. at
an early stage the diaphragm and the muscles of the anterior abdominal
wall become contracted; later the muscles of the back and thorax are
involved; and lastly those of the limbs. although this is the typical
order of involvement of the different groups of muscles, it is not
always adhered to.

to this permanent tonic contraction of the muscles there are soon added
clonic spasms. these spasms are at first slight and transient, with
prolonged intervals between the attacks, but rapidly tend to become more
frequent, more severe, and of longer duration, until eventually the
patient simply passes out of one seizure into another.

the distribution of the spasms varies in different cases: in some it is
confined to particular groups of muscles, such as those of the neck,
back, abdominal walls, or limbs; in others all these groups are
simultaneously involved.

when the muscles of the back become spasmodically contracted, the body
is raised from the bed, sometimes to such an extent that the patient
rests only on his heels and occiput--the position of _opisthotonos_.
lateral arching of the body from excessive action of the muscles on one
side--_pleurosthotonos_--is not uncommon, the arching usually taking
place towards the side on which the wound of infection exists. less
frequently the body is bent forward so that the knees and chin almost
meet (_emprosthotonos_). sometimes all the muscles simultaneously become
rigid, so that the body assumes a statuesque attitude (_orthotonos_).
when the thoracic muscles, including the diaphragm, are thrown into
spasm, the patient experiences a distressing sensation as if he were
gripped in a vice, and has extreme difficulty in getting breath. between
the attacks the limbs are kept rigidly extended. the clonic spasms may
be so severe as to rupture muscles or even to fracture one of the long
bones.

as time goes on, the clonic exacerbations become more and more frequent,
and the slightest external stimulus, such as the feeling of the pulse, a
whisper in the room, a noise in the street, a draught of cold air, the
effort to swallow, a question addressed to the patient or his attempt to
answer, is sufficient to determine an attack. the movements are so
forcible and so continuous that the nurse has great difficulty in
keeping the bedclothes on the patient, or even in keeping him in bed.

the general condition of the patient is pitiful in the extreme. he is
fully conscious of the gravity of the disease, and his mind remains
clear to the end. the suffering induced by the cramp-like spasms of the
muscles keeps him in a constant state of fearful apprehension of the
next seizure, and he is unable to sleep until he becomes utterly
exhausted.

the temperature is moderately raised (100 o to 102 o f.), or may remain
normal throughout. shortly before death very high temperatures (110 o f.)
have been recorded, and it has been observed that the thermometer
sometimes continues to rise after death, and may reach as high as
112 o f. or more.

the pulse corresponds with the febrile condition. it is accelerated
during the spasms, and may become exceedingly rapid and feeble before
death, probably from paralysis of the vagus. sudden death from cardiac
paralysis or from cardiac spasm is not uncommon.

the respiration is affected in so far as the spasms of the respiratory
muscles produce dyspnoea, and a feeling of impending suffocation which
adds to the horrors of the disease.

one of the most constant symptoms is a copious perspiration, the patient
being literally bathed in sweat. the urine is diminished in quantity,
but as a rule is normal in composition; as in other acute infective
conditions, albumen and blood may be present. retention of urine may
result from spasm of the urethral muscles, and necessitate the use of
the catheter.

the fits may cease some time before death, or, on the other hand, death
may occur during a paroxysm from fixation of the diaphragm and arrest of
respiration.

_differential diagnosis._--there is little difficulty, as a rule, in
diagnosing a case of fulminating tetanus, but there are several
conditions with which it may occasionally be confused. in _strychnin
poisoning_, for example, the spasms come on immediately after the
patient has taken a toxic dose of the drug; they are clonic in
character, but the muscles are relaxed between the fits. if the dose is
not lethal, the spasms soon cease. in _hydrophobia_ a history of having
been bitten by a rabid animal is usually forthcoming; the spasms, which
are clonic in character, affect chiefly the muscles of respiration and
deglutition, and pass off entirely in the intervals between attacks.
certain cases of _haemorrhage into the lateral ventricles_ of the brain
also simulate tetanus, but an analysis of the symptoms will prevent
errors in diagnosis. _cerebro-spinal meningitis_ and _basal meningitis_
present certain superficial resemblances to tetanus, but there is no
trismus, and the spasms chiefly affect the muscles of the neck and
back. _hysteria and catalepsy_ may assume characters resembling those
of tetanus, but there is little difficulty in distinguishing between
these diseases. lastly, in the _tetany_ of children, or that following
operations on the thyreoid gland, the spasms are of a jerking character,
affect chiefly the hands and fingers, and yield to medicinal treatment.

#chronic tetanus.#--the difference between this and acute tetanus is
mainly one of degree. its incubation period is longer, it is more slow
and insidious in its progress, and it never reaches the same degree of
severity. trismus is the most marked and constant form of spasm; and
while the trunk muscles may be involved, those of respiration as a rule
escape. every additional day the patient lives adds to the probability
of his ultimate recovery. when the disease does prove fatal, it is from
exhaustion, and not from respiratory or cardiac spasm. the usual
duration is from six to ten weeks.

#delayed tetanus.#--during the european war acute tetanus occasionally
developed many weeks or even months after a patient had been injured,
and when the original wound had completely healed. it usually followed
some secondary operation, _e.g._, for the removal of a foreign body, or
the breaking down of adhesions, which aroused latent organisms.

#local tetanus.#--this term is applied to a form of the disease in which
the hypertonus and spasms are localised to the muscles in the vicinity
of the wound. it usually occurs in patients who have had prophylactic
injections of anti-tetanic serum, the toxins entering the blood being
probably neutralised by the antibodies in circulation, while those
passing along the motor nerves are unaffected.

when it occurs in the _limbs_, attention is usually directed to the fact
by pain accompanying the spasms; the muscles are found to be hard and
there are frequent twitchings of the limb. a characteristic reflex is
present in the lower extremity, namely, extension of the foot and leg
when the sole is tickled.

_cephalic tetanus_ is another localised variety which follows injury in
the distribution of the facial nerve. it is characterised by the
occurrence on the same side as the injury, of facial spasm, rapidly
followed by more or less complete paralysis of the muscles of
expression, with unilateral trismus and difficulty in swallowing. other
cranial nerves, particularly the oculomotor and the hypoglossal, may
also be implicated. a remarkable feature of this condition is that
although the muscles are irresponsive to ordinary physiological stimuli,
they are thrown into spasm by the abnormal impulses of tetanus.

_trismus._--this term is used to denote a form of tetanic spasm limited
to the muscles of mastication. it is really a mild form of chronic
tetanus, and the prognosis is favourable. it must not be confused with
the fixation of the jaw sometimes associated with a wisdom-tooth
gumboil, with tonsillitis, or with affections of the temporo-mandibular
articulation.

_tetanus neonatorum_ is a form of tetanus occurring in infants of about
a week old. infection takes place through the umbilicus, and manifests
itself clinically by spasms of the muscles of mastication. it is almost
invariably fatal within a few days.

_prophylaxis._--experience in the european war has established the
fact that the routine injection of anti-tetanic serum to all patients
with lacerated and contaminated wounds greatly reduces the frequency of
tetanus. the sooner the serum is given after the injury, the more
certain is its effect; within twenty-four hours 1500 units injected
subcutaneously is sufficient for the initial dose; if a longer period
has elapsed, 2000 to 3000 units should be given intra-muscularly, as
this ensures more rapid absorption. a second injection is given a week
after the first.

the wound must be purified in the usual way, and all instruments and
appliances used for operations on tetanic patients must be immediately
sterilised by prolonged boiling.

_treatment._--when tetanus has developed the main indications are to
prevent the further production of toxins in the wound, and to neutralise
those that have been absorbed into the nervous system. thorough
purification with antiseptics, excision of devitalised tissues, and
drainage of the wound are first carried out. to arrest the absorption of
toxins intra-muscular injections of 10,000 units of serum are given
daily into the muscles of the affected limb, or directly into the nerve
trunks leading from the focus of infection, in the hope of "blocking"
the nerves with antitoxin and so preventing the passage of toxins
towards the spinal cord.

to neutralise the toxins that have already reached the spinal cord, 5000
units should be injected intra-thecally daily for four or five days, the
foot of the bed being raised to enable the serum to reach the upper
parts of the cord.

the quantity of toxin circulating in the blood is so small as to be
practically negligible, and the risk of anaphylactic shock attending
intra-venous injection outweighs any benefit likely to follow this
procedure.

baccelli recommends the injection of 20 c.c. of a 1 in 100 solution of
carbolic acid into the subcutaneous tissues every four hours during the
period that the contractions persist. opinions vary as to the
efficiency of this treatment. the intra-thecal injection of 10 c.c. of a
15 per cent. solution of magnesium sulphate has proved beneficial in
alleviating the severity of the spasms, but does not appear to have a
curative effect.

to conserve the patient's strength by preventing or diminishing the
severity of the spasms, he should be placed in a quiet room, and every
form of disturbance avoided. sedatives, such as bromides, paraldehyde,
or opium, must be given in large doses. chloral is perhaps the best, and
the patient should rarely have less than 150 grains in twenty-four
hours. when he is unable to swallow, it should be given by the rectum.
the administration of chloroform is of value in conserving the strength
of the patient, by abolishing the spasms, and enabling the attendants to
administer nourishment or drugs either through a stomach tube or by the
rectum. extreme elevation of temperature is met by tepid sponging. it is
necessary to use the catheter if retention of urine occurs.


hydrophobia

hydrophobia is an acute infective disease following on the bite of a
rabid animal. it most commonly follows the bite or lick of a rabid dog
or cat. the virus appears to be communicated through the saliva of the
animal, and to show a marked affinity for nerve tissues; and the disease
is most likely to develop when the patient is infected on the face or
other uncovered part, or in a part richly endowed with nerves.

a dog which has bitten a person should on no account be killed until its
condition has been proved one way or the other. should rabies develop
and its destruction become necessary, the head and spinal cord should be
retained and forwarded, packed in ice, to a competent observer. much
anxiety to the person bitten and to his friends would be avoided if
these rules were observed, because in many cases it will be shown that
the animal did not after all suffer from rabies, and that the patient
consequently runs no risk. if, on the other hand, rabies is proved to be
present, the patient should be submitted to the pasteur treatment.

_clinical features._--there is almost always a history of the patient
having been bitten or licked by an animal supposed to suffer from
rabies. the incubation period averages about forty days, but varies from
a fortnight to seven or eight months, and is shorter in young than in
old persons. the original wound has long since healed, and beyond a
slight itchiness or pain shooting along the nerves of the part, shows no
sign of disturbance. a few days of general malaise, with chills and
giddiness precede the onset of the acute manifestations, which affect
chiefly the muscles of deglutition and respiration. one of the earliest
signs is that the patient has periodically a sudden catch in his
breathing "resembling what often occurs when a person goes into a cold
bath." this is due to spasm of the diaphragm, and is frequently
accompanied by a loud-sounding hiccough, likened by the laity to the
barking of a dog. difficulty in swallowing fluids may be the first
symptom.

the spasms rapidly spread to all the muscles of deglutition and
respiration, so that the patient not only has the greatest difficulty in
swallowing, but has a constant sense of impending suffocation. to add to
his distress, a copious secretion of viscid saliva fills his mouth. any
voluntary effort, as well as all forms of external stimuli, only serve
to aggravate the spasms which are always induced by the attempt to
swallow fluid, or even by the sound of running water.

the temperature is raised; the pulse is small, rapid, and intermittent;
and the urine may contain sugar and albumen.

the mind may remain clear to the end, or the patient may have delusions,
supposing himself to be surrounded by terrifying forms. there is always
extreme mental agitation and despair, and the sufferer is in constant
fear of his impending fate. happily the inevitable issue is not long
delayed, death usually occurring in from two to four days from the
onset. the symptoms of the disease are so characteristic that there is
no difficulty in diagnosis. the only condition with which it is liable
to be confused is the variety of cephalic tetanus in which the muscles
of deglutition are specially involved--the so-called tetanus
hydrophobicus.

_prophylaxis._--the bite of an animal suspected of being rabid should be
cauterised at once by means of the actual or paquelin cautery, or by a
strong chemical escharotic such as pure carbolic acid, after which
antiseptic dressings are applied.

it is, however, to pasteur's _preventive inoculation_ that we must look
for our best hope of averting the onset of symptoms. "it may now be
taken as established that a grave responsibility rests on those
concerned if a person bitten by a mad animal is not subjected to the
pasteur treatment" (muir and ritchie).

this method is based on the fact that the long incubation period of the
disease admits of the patient being inoculated with a modified virus
producing a mild attack, which protects him from the natural disease.

_treatment._--when the symptoms have once developed they can only be
palliated. the patient must be kept absolutely quiet and free from all
sources of irritation. the spasms may be diminished by means of chloral
and bromides, or by chloroform inhalation.


anthrax

anthrax is a comparatively rare disease, communicable to man from
certain of the lower animals, such as sheep, oxen, horses, deer, and
other herbivora. in animals it is characterised by symptoms of acute
general poisoning, and, from the fact that it produces a marked
enlargement of the spleen, is known in veterinary surgery as "splenic
fever."

the _bacillus anthracis_ (fig. 27), the largest of the known pathogenic
bacteria, occurs in groups or in chains made up of numerous bacilli,
each bacillus measuring from 6 to 8 u in length. the organisms are found
in enormous numbers throughout the bodies of animals that have died of
anthrax, and are readily recognised and cultivated. sporulation only
takes place outside the body, probably because free oxygen is necessary
to the process. in the spore-free condition, the organisms are readily
destroyed by ordinary germicides, and by the gastric juice. the spores,
on the other hand, have a high degree of resistance. not only do they
remain viable in the dry state for long periods, even up to a year, but
they survive boiling for five minutes, and must be subjected to dry heat
at 140 o c. for several hours before they are destroyed.

[illustration: fig. 27.--bacillus of anthrax in section of skin, from a
case of malignant pustule; shows vesicle containing bacilli. x 400 diam.
gram's stain.]

_clinical varieties of anthrax._--in man, anthrax may manifest itself in
one of three clinical forms.

it may be transmitted by means of spores or bacilli directly from a
diseased animal to those who, by their occupation or otherwise, are
brought into contact with it--for example, shepherds, butchers,
veterinary surgeons, or hide-porters. infection may occur on the face by
the use of a shaving-brush contaminated by spores. the path of infection
is usually through an abrasion of the skin, and the primary
manifestations are local, constituting what is known as _the malignant
pustule_.

in other cases the disease is contracted through the inhalation of the
dried spores into the respiratory passages. this occurs oftenest in
those who work amongst wool, fur, and rags, and a form of acute
pneumonia of great virulence ensues. this affection is known as
_wool-sorter's disease_, and is almost universally fatal.

there is reason to believe that infection may also take place by means
of spores ingested into the alimentary canal in meat or milk derived
from diseased animals, or in infected water.

#clinical features of malignant pustule.#--we shall here confine
ourselves to the consideration of the local lesion as it occurs in the
skin--_the malignant pustule_.

the point of infection is usually on an uncovered part of the body, such
as the face, hands, arms, or back of the neck, and the wound may be
exceedingly minute. after an incubation period varying from a few hours
to several days, a reddish nodule resembling a small boil appears at the
seat of inoculation, the immediately surrounding skin becomes swollen
and indurated, and over the indurated area there appear a number of
small vesicles containing serum, which at first is clear but soon
becomes blood-stained (fig. 28). coincidently the subcutaneous tissue
for a considerable distance around becomes markedly oedematous, and the
skin red and tense. within a few hours, blood is extravasated in the
centre of the indurated area, the blisters burst, and a dark brown or
black eschar, composed of necrosed skin and subcutaneous tissue and
altered blood, forms (fig. 29). meanwhile the induration extends, fresh
vesicles form and in turn burst, and the eschar increases in size. the
neighbouring lymph glands soon become swollen and tender. the affected
part is hot and itchy, but the patient does not complain of great pain.
there is a moderate degree of constitutional disturbance, with headache,
nausea, and sometimes shivering.

if the infection becomes generalised--_anthracaemia_--the temperature
rises to 103 o or 104 o f., the pulse becomes feeble and rapid, and other
signs of severe blood-poisoning appear: vomiting, diarrhoea, pains in the
limbs, headache and delirium, and the condition proves fatal in from
five to eight days.

_differential diagnosis._--when the malignant pustule is fully
developed, the central slough with the surrounding vesicles and the
widespread oedema are characteristic. the bacillus can be obtained from
the peripheral portion of the slough, from the blisters, and from the
adjacent lymph vessels and glands. the occupation of the patient may
suggest the possibility of anthrax infection.

[illustration: fig. 28.--malignant pustule, third day after infection
with anthrax, showing great oedema of upper extremity and pectoral region
(cf. fig. 29).]

[illustration: fig. 29.--malignant pustule, fourteen days after
infection, showing black eschar in process of separation. the oedema has
largely disappeared. treated by sclavo's serum (cf. fig. 28).]

_prophylaxis._--any wound suspected of being infected with anthrax
should at once be cauterised with caustic potash, the actual cautery, or
pure carbolic acid.

_treatment._--the best results hitherto obtained have followed the use
of the anti-anthrax serum introduced by sclavo. the initial dose is 40
c.c., and if the serum is given early in the disease, the beneficial
effects are manifest in a few hours. favourable results have also
followed the use of pyocyanase, a vaccine prepared from the bacillus
pyocyaneus.

by some it is recommended that the local lesion should be freely
excised; others advocate cauterisation of the affected part with solid
caustic potash till all the indurated area is softened. graf has had
excellent results by the latter method in a large series of cases, the
oedema subsiding in about twenty-four hours and the constitutional
symptoms rapidly improving. wolff and wiewiorowski, on the other hand,
have had equally good results by simply protecting the local lesion with
a mild antiseptic dressing, and relying upon general treatment.

the general treatment consists in feeding and stimulating the patient as
freely as possible. quinine, in 5 to 10 grain doses every four hours,
and powdered ipecacuanha, in 40 to 60 grain doses every four hours, have
also been employed with apparent benefit.


glanders

glanders is due to the action of a specific bacterium, the _bacillus
mallei_, which resembles the tubercle bacillus, save that it is somewhat
shorter and broader, and does not stain by gram's method. it requires
higher temperatures for its cultivation than the tubercle bacillus, and
its growth on potato is of a characteristic chocolate-brown colour, with
a greenish-yellow ring at the margin of the growth. the bacillus mallei
retains its vitality for long periods under ordinary conditions, but is
readily killed by heat and chemical agents. it does not form spores.

_clinical features._--both in the lower animals and in man the bacillus
gives rise to two distinct types of disease--_acute glanders_, and
_chronic glanders_ or _farcy_.

acute glanders is most commonly met with in the horse and in other
equine animals, horned cattle being immune. it affects the septum of the
nose and adjacent parts, firm, translucent, greyish nodules containing
lymphoid and epithelioid cells appearing in the mucous membrane. these
nodules subsequently break down in the centre, forming irregular
ulcers, which are attended with profuse discharge, and marked
inflammatory swelling. the cervical lymph glands, as well as the lungs,
spleen, and liver, may be the seat of secondary nodules.

_in man_, acute glanders is commoner than the chronic variety. infection
always takes place through an abraded surface, and usually on one of the
uncovered parts of the body--most commonly the skin of the hands, arms,
or face; or on the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, or eye. the
disease has been acquired by accidental inoculation in the course of
experimental investigations in the laboratory, and proved fatal. the
incubation period is from three to five days.

the _local_ manifestations are pain and swelling in the region of the
infected wound, with inflammatory redness around it and along the lines
of the superficial lymphatics. in the course of a week, small, firm
nodules appear, and are rapidly transformed into pustules. these may
occur on the face and in the vicinity of joints, and may be mistaken for
the eruption of small-pox.

after breaking down, these pustules give rise to irregular ulcers, which
by their confluence lead to extensive destruction of skin. sometimes the
nasal mucous membrane becomes affected, and produces a discharge--at
first watery, but later sanious and purulent. necrosis of the bones of
the nose may take place, in which case the discharge becomes peculiarly
offensive. in nearly every case metastatic abscesses form in different
parts of the body, such as the lungs, joints, or muscles.

during the development of the disease the patient feels ill, complains
of headache and pains in the limbs, the temperature rises to 104 o or
even to 106 o f., and assumes a pyaemic type. the pulse becomes rapid and
weak. the tongue is dry and brown. there is profuse sweating,
albuminuria, and often insomnia with delirium. death may take place
within a week, but more frequently occurs during the second or third
week.

_differential diagnosis._--there is nothing characteristic in the site
of the primary lesion in man, and the condition may, during the early
stages, be mistaken for a boil or carbuncle, or for any acute
inflammatory condition. later, the disease may simulate acute articular
rheumatism, or may manifest all the symptoms of acute septicaemia or
pyaemia. the diagnosis is established by the recognition of the bacillus.
veterinary surgeons attach great importance to the mallein test as a
means of diagnosis in animals, but in the human subject its use is
attended with considerable risk and is not to be recommended.

_treatment._--excision of the primary nodule, followed by the
application of the thermo-cautery and sponging with pure carbolic acid,
should be carried out, provided the condition is sufficiently limited to
render complete removal practicable.

when secondary abscesses form in accessible situations, they must be
incised, disinfected, and drained. the general treatment is carried out
on the same lines as in other acute infective diseases.

#chronic glanders.#--_in the horse_ the chronic form of glanders is
known as _farcy_, and follows infection through an abrasion of the skin,
involving chiefly the superficial lymph vessels and glands. the
lymphatics become indurated and nodular, constituting what veterinarians
call _farcy pipes_ and _farcy buds_.

_in man_ also the clinical features of the chronic variety of the
disease are somewhat different from those of the acute form. here, too,
infection takes place through a broken cutaneous surface, and leads to a
superficial lymphangitis with nodular thickening of the lymphatics
(_farcy buds_). the neighbouring glands soon become swollen and
indurated. the primary lesion meanwhile inflames, suppurates, and, after
breaking down, leaves a large, irregular ulcer with thickened edges and
a foul, purulent or bloody discharge. the glands break down in the same
way, and lead to wide destruction of skin, and the resulting sinuses and
ulcers are exceedingly intractable. secondary deposits in the
subcutaneous tissue, the muscles, and other parts, are not uncommon, and
the nasal mucous membrane may become involved. the disease often runs a
chronic course, extending to four or five months, or even longer.
recovery takes place in about 50 per cent. of cases, but the
convalescence is prolonged, and at any time the disease may assume the
characters of the acute variety and speedily prove fatal.

the _differential diagnosis_ is often difficult, especially in the
chronic nodules, in which it may be impossible to demonstrate the
bacillus. the ulcerated lesions of farcy have to be distinguished from
those of tubercle, syphilis, and other forms of infective granuloma.

_treatment._--limited areas of disease should be completely excised. the
general condition of the patient must be improved by tonics, good food,
and favourable hygienic surroundings. in some cases potassium iodide
acts beneficially.


actinomycosis

actinomycosis is a chronic disease due to the action of an organism
somewhat higher in the vegetable scale than ordinary bacteria--the
_streptothrix actinomyces_ or _ray fungus_.

[illustration: fig. 30.--section of actinomycosis colony in pus from
abscess of liver, showing filaments and clubs of streptothrix
actinomyces. x 400 diam. gram's stain.]

_etiology and morbid anatomy._--the actinomyces, which has never been
met with outside the body, gives rise in oxen, horses, and other animals
to tumour-like masses composed of granulation tissue; and in man to
chronic suppurative processes which may result in a condition resembling
chronic pyaemia. the actinomyces is more complex in structure than other
pathogenic organisms, and occurs in the tissues in the form of small,
round, semi-translucent bodies, about the size of a pin-head or less,
and consisting of colonies of the fungus. on account of their yellow
tint they are spoken of as "sulphur grains." each colony is made up of a
series of thin, interlacing, and branching _filaments_, some of which
are broken up so as to form masses or chains of _cocci_; and around the
periphery of the colony are elongated, pear-shaped, hyaline, _club-like
bodies_ (fig. 30).

infection is believed to be conveyed by the husks of cereals, especially
barley; and the organism has been found adhering to particles of grain
embedded in the tissues of animals suffering from the disease. in the
human subject there is often a history of exposure to infection from
such sources, and the disease is said to be most common during the
harvesting months.

around each colony of actinomyces is a zone of granulation tissue in
which suppuration usually occurs, so that the fungus comes to lie in a
bath of greenish-yellow pus. as the process spreads these purulent foci
become confluent and form abscess cavities. when metastasis takes place,
as it occasionally does, the fungus is transmitted by the blood vessels,
as in pyaemia.

_clinical features._--in man the disease may be met with in the skin,
the organisms gaining access through an abrasion, and spreading by the
formation of new nodules in the same way as tuberculosis.

the region of the mouth and jaws is one of the commonest sites of
surgical actinomycosis. infection takes place, as a rule, along the side
of a carious tooth, and spreads to the lower jaw. a swelling is slowly
and insidiously developed, but when the loose connective tissue of the
neck becomes infiltrated, the spread is more rapid. the whole region
becomes infiltrated and swollen, and the skin ultimately gives way and
free suppuration occurs, resulting in the formation of sinuses. the
characteristic greenish-grey or yellow granules are seen in the pus, and
when examined microscopically reveal the colonies of actinomyces.

less frequently the maxilla becomes affected, and the disease may spread
to the base of the skull and brain. the vertebrae may become involved by
infection taking place through the pharynx or oesophagus, and leading to
a condition simulating tuberculous disease of the spine. when it
implicates the intestinal canal and its accessory glands, the lungs,
pleura, and bronchial tubes, or the brain, the disease is not amenable
to surgical treatment.

_differential diagnosis._--the conditions likely to be mistaken for
surgical actinomycosis are sarcoma, tubercle, and syphilis. in the early
stages the differential diagnosis is exceedingly difficult. in many
cases it is only possible when suppuration has occurred and the fungus
can be demonstrated.

the slow destruction of the affected tissue by suppuration, the absence
of pain, tenderness, and redness, simulate tuberculosis, but the absence
of glandular involvement helps to distinguish it.

syphilitic lesions are liable to be mistaken for actinomycosis, all the
more that in both diseases improvement follows the administration of
iodides. when it affects the lower jaw, in its early stages,
actinomycosis may closely simulate a periosteal sarcoma.

[illustration: fig. 31.--actinomycosis of maxilla. the disease spread to
opposite side; finally implicated base of skull, and proved fatal.
treated by radium.

(mr. d. p. d. wilkie's case.)]

the recognition of the fungus is the crucial point in diagnosis.

_prognosis._--spontaneous cure rarely occurs. when the disease
implicates internal organs, it is almost always fatal. on external parts
the destructive process gradually spreads, and the patient eventually
succumbs to superadded septic infection. when, from its situation, the
primary focus admits of removal, the prognosis is more favourable.

_treatment._--the surgical treatment is early and free removal of the
affected tissues, after which the wound is cauterised by the actual
cautery, and sponged over with pure carbolic acid. the cavity is packed
with iodoform gauze, no attempt being made to close the wound.

success has attended the use of a vaccine prepared from cultures of the
organism; and the x-rays and radium, combined with the administration of
iodides in large doses, or with intra-muscular injections of a 10 per
cent. solution of cacodylate of soda, have proved of benefit.

mycetoma, or madura foot.--mycetoma is a chronic disease due to
an organism resembling that of actinomycosis, but not identical with it.
it is endemic in certain tropical countries, and is most frequently met
with in india. infection takes place through an abrasion of the skin,
and the disease usually occurs on the feet of adult males who work
barefooted in the fields.

_clinical features._--the disease begins on the foot as an indurated
patch, which becomes discoloured and permeated by black or yellow
nodules containing the organism. these nodules break down by
suppuration, and numerous minute abscesses lined by granulation tissues
are thus formed. in the pus are found yellow particles likened to
fish-roe, or black pigmented granules like gunpowder. sinuses form, and
the whole foot becomes greatly swollen and distorted by flattening of
the sole and dorsiflexion of the toes. areas of caries or necrosis occur
in the bones, and the disease gradually extends up the leg (fig. 32).
there is but little pain, and no glandular involvement or constitutional
disturbance. the disease runs a prolonged course, sometimes lasting for
twenty or thirty years. spontaneous cure never takes place, and the risk
to life is that of prolonged suppuration.

if the disease is localised, it may be removed by the knife or sharp
spoon, and the part afterwards cauterised. as a rule, amputation well
above the disease is the best line of treatment. unlike actinomycosis,
this disease does not appear to be benefited by iodides.

delhi boil.--_synonyms_--aleppo boil, biskra button, furunculus
orientalis, natal sore.

delhi boil is a chronic inflammatory disease, most commonly met with in
india, especially towards the end of the wet season. the disease occurs
oftenest on the face, and is believed to be due to an organism, although
this has not been demonstrated. the infection is supposed to be conveyed
through water used for washing, or by the bites of insects.

_clinical features._--a red spot, resembling the mark of a mosquito
bite, appears on the affected part, and is attended with itching. after
becoming papular and increasing to the size of a pea, desquamation takes
place, leaving a dull-red surface, over which in the course of several
weeks there develops a series of small yellowish-white spots, from which
serum exudes, and, drying, forms a thick scab. under this scab the skin
ulcerates, leaving small oval sores with sharply bevelled edges, and an
uneven floor covered with yellow or sanious pus. these sores vary in
number from one to forty or fifty. they may last for months and then
heal spontaneously, or may continue to spread until arrested by suitable
treatment. there is no enlargement of adjacent glands, and but little
inflammatory reaction in the surrounding tissues; nor is there any
marked constitutional disturbance. recovery is often followed by
cicatricial contraction leading to deformity of the face.

the _treatment_ consists in destroying the original papule by the actual
cautery, acid nitrate of mercury, or pure carbolic acid. the ulcers
should be scraped with the sharp spoon, and cauterised.

chigoe.--chigoe or jigger results from the introduction of the
eggs of the sand-flea (_pulex penetrans_) into the tissues. it occurs in
tropical africa, south america, and the west indies. the impregnated
female flea remains attached to the part till the eggs mature, when by
their irritation they cause localised inflammation with pustules or
vesicles on the surface. children are most commonly attacked,
particularly about the toe-nails and on the scrotum. the treatment
consists in picking out the insect with a blunt needle, special care
being taken not to break it up. the puncture is then cauterised. the
application of essential oils to the feet acts as a preventive.

poisoning by insects.--the bites of certain insects, such as
mosquitoes, midges, different varieties of flies, wasps, and spiders,
may be followed by serious complications. the effects are mainly due to
the injection of an irritant acid secretion, the exact nature of which
has not been ascertained.

the local lesion is a puncture, surrounded by a zone of hyperaemia,
wheals, or vesicles, and is associated with burning sensations and
itching which usually pass off in a few hours, but may recur at
intervals, especially when the patient is warm in bed. scratching also
reproduces the local signs and symptoms. where the connective tissue is
loose--for example, in the eyelid or scrotum--there is often
considerable swelling; and in the mouth and fauces this may lead to
oedema of the glottis, which may prove fatal.

the _treatment_ consists in the local application of dilute alkalies
such as ammonia water, solutions of carbonate or bicarbonate of soda, or
sal-volatile. weak carbolic lotions, or lead and opium lotion, are
useful in allaying the local irritation. one of the best means of
neutralising the poison is to apply to the sting a drop of a mixture
containing equal parts of pure carbolic acid and liquor ammoniae.

free stimulation is called for when severe constitutional symptoms are
present.

snake-bites.--we are here only concerned with the injuries
inflicted by the venomous varieties of snakes, the most important of
which are the hooded snakes of india, the rattle-snakes of america, the
horned snakes of africa, the viper of europe, and the adder of the
united kingdom.

while the virulence of these creatures varies widely, they are all
capable of producing in a greater or less degree symptoms of acute
poisoning in man and other animals. by means of two recurved fangs
attached to the upper jaw, and connected by a duct with poison-secreting
glands, they introduce into their prey a thick, transparent, yellowish
fluid, of acid reaction, probably of the nature of an albumose, and
known as the _venom_.

the _clinical features_ resulting from the injection of the venom vary
directly in intensity with the amount of the poison introduced, and the
rapidity with which it reaches the circulating blood, being most marked
when it immediately enters a large vein. the poison is innocuous when
taken into the stomach.

_locally_ the snake inflicts a double wound, passing vertically into the
subcutaneous tissue; the edges of the punctures are ecchymosed, and the
adjacent vessels the seat of thrombosis. immediately there is intense
pain, and considerable swelling with congestion, which tends to spread
towards the trunk. extensive gangrene may ensue. there is no special
involvement of the lymphatics.

the _general symptoms_ may come on at once if the snake is a
particularly venomous one, or not for some hours if less virulent. in
the majority of viper or adder bites the constitutional disturbance is
slight and transient, if it appears at all. snake-bites in children are
particularly dangerous.

the patient's condition is one of profound shock with faintness,
giddiness, dimness of sight, and a feeling of great terror. the pupils
dilate, the skin becomes moist with a clammy sweat, and nausea with
vomiting, sometimes of blood, ensues. high fever, cramps, loss of
sensation, haematuria, and melaena are among the other symptoms that may
be present. the pulse becomes feeble and rapid, the respiratory nerve
centres are profoundly depressed, and delirium followed by coma usually
precedes the fatal issue, which may take place in from five to
forty-eight hours. if the patient survives for two days the prognosis is
favourable.

_treatment._--a broad ligature should be tied tightly round the limb
above the seat of infection, to prevent the poison passing into the
general circulation, and bleeding from the wound should be encouraged.
the application of an elastic bandage from above downward to empty the
blood out of the infected portion of the limb has been recommended. the
whole of the bite should at once be excised, and crystals of
permanganate of potash rubbed into the wound until it is black, or
peroxide of hydrogen applied with the object of destroying the poison by
oxidation.

the general treatment consists in free stimulation with whisky, brandy,
ammonia, digitalis, etc. hypodermic injections of strychnin in doses
sufficiently large to produce a slight degree of poisoning by the drug
are particularly useful. the most rational treatment, when it is
available, is the use of the _antivenin_ introduced by fraser and
calmette.

tuberculosis


tubercle bacillus--methods of infection--inherited and acquired
    predisposition--relationship of tuberculosis to injury--human and
    bovine tuberculosis--action of the bacillus upon the
    tissues--tuberculous granulation tissue--natural cure--recrudescence
    of the disease--the tuberculous abscess--contents and wall of the
    abscess--tuberculous sinuses.

tuberculosis occurs more frequently in some situations than in others;
it is common, for example, in lymph glands, in bones and joints, in the
peritoneum, the intestine, the kidney, prostate and testis, and in the
skin and subcutaneous cellular tissue; it is seldom met with in the
breast or in muscles, and it rarely affects the ovary, the pancreas, the
parotid, or the thyreoid.

_tubercle bacilli_ vary widely in their virulence, and they are more
tenacious of life than the common pyogenic bacteria. in a dry state, for
example, they can retain their vitality for months; and they can also
survive immersion in water for prolonged periods. they resist the action
of the products of putrefaction for a considerable time, and are not
destroyed by digestive processes in the stomach and intestine. they may
be killed in a few minutes by boiling, or by exposure to steam under
pressure, or by immersion for less than a minute in 1 in 20 carbolic
lotion.

#methods of infection.#--in marked contrast to what obtains in the
infective diseases that have already been described, tuberculosis rarely
results from the _infection of a wound_. in exceptional instances,
however, this does occur, and in illustration of the fact may be cited
the case of a servant who cut her finger with a broken spittoon
containing the sputum of her consumptive master; the wound subsequently
showed evidence of tuberculous infection, which ultimately spread up
along the lymph vessels of the arm. pathologists, too, whose hands,
before the days of rubber gloves, were frequently exposed to the contact
of tuberculous tissues and pus, were liable to suffer from a form of
tuberculosis of the skin of the finger, known as _anatomical tubercle_.
slight wounds of the feet in children who go about barefoot in towns
sometimes become infected with tubercle. operation wounds made with
instruments contaminated with tuberculous material have also been known
to become infected. it is highly probable that the common form of
tuberculosis of the skin known as "lupus" arises by direct infection
from without.

[illustration: fig. 33.--tubercle bacilli in caseous material
x 1000 diam. z. neilsen stain.]

in the vast majority of cases the tubercle bacillus gains entrance to
the body by way of the mucous surfaces, the organisms being either
inhaled or swallowed; those inhaled are mostly derived from the human
subject, those swallowed, from cattle. bacilli, whether inhaled or
swallowed, are especially apt to lodge about the pharynx and pass to the
pharyngeal lymphoid tissue and tonsils, and by way of the lymph vessels
to the glands. the glands most frequently infected in this way are the
cervical glands, and those within the cavity of the chest--particularly
the bronchial glands at the root of the lung. from these, infection
extends at any later period in life to the bones, joints, and internal
organs.

there is reason to believe that the organisms may lie in a dormant
condition for an indefinite period in these glands, and only become
active long afterwards, when some depression of the patient's health
produces conditions which favour their growth. when the organisms become
active in this way, the tuberculous tissue undergoes softening and
disintegration, and the infective material, by bursting into an adjacent
vein, may enter the blood-stream, in which it is carried to distant
parts of the body. in this way a _general tuberculosis_ may be set up,
or localised foci of tuberculosis may develop in the tissues in which
the organisms lodge. many tuberculous patients are to be regarded as
possessing in their bronchial glands, or elsewhere, an internal store of
bacilli, to which the disease for which advice is sought owes its
origin, and from which similar outbreaks of tuberculosis may originate
in the future.

_the alimentary mucous membrane_, especially that of the lower ileum and
caecum, is exposed to infection by swallowed sputum and by food
materials, such as milk, containing tubercle bacilli. the organisms may
lodge in the mucous membrane and cause tuberculous ulceration, or they
may be carried through the wall of the bowel into the lacteals, along
which they pass to the mesenteric glands where they become arrested and
give rise to tuberculous disease.

#relationship of tuberculosis to trauma.#--any tissue whose vitality has
been lowered by injury or disease furnishes a favourable nidus for the
lodgment and growth of tubercle bacilli. the injury or disease, however,
is to be looked upon as determining the _localisation_ of the
tuberculous lesion rather than as an essential factor in its causation.
in a person, for example, in whose blood tubercle bacilli are
circulating and reaching every tissue and organ of the body, the
occurrence of tuberculous disease in a particular part may be determined
by the depression of the tissues resulting from an injury of that part.
there can be no doubt that excessive movement and jarring of a limb
aggravates tuberculous disease of a joint; also that an injury may light
up a focus that has been long quiescent, but we do not agree with
those--da costa, for example--who maintain that injury may be a
determining cause of tuberculosis. the question is not one of mere
academic interest, but one that may raise important issues in the law
courts.

#human and bovine tuberculosis.#--the frequency of the bovine bacillus
in the abdominal and in the glandular and osseous tuberculous lesions of
children would appear to justify the conclusion that the disease is
transmissible from the ox to the human subject, and that the milk of
tuberculous cows is probably a common vehicle of transmission.

#changes in the tissues following upon the successful lodgment of
tubercle bacilli.#--the action of the bacilli on the tissues results in
the formation of granulation tissue comprising characteristic tissue
elements and with a marked tendency to undergo caseation.

the recognition of the characteristic elements, with or without
caseation, is usually sufficient evidence of the tuberculous nature of
any portion of tissue examined for diagnostic purposes. the recognition
of the bacillus itself by appropriate methods of staining makes the
diagnosis a certainty; but as it is by no means easy to identify the
organism in many forms of surgical tuberculosis, it may be necessary to
have recourse to experimental inoculation of susceptible animals such as
guinea-pigs.

the changes subsequent to the formation of tuberculous granulation
tissue are liable to many variations. it must always be borne in mind
that although the bacilli have effected a lodgment and have inaugurated
disease, the relation between them and the tissues remains one of mutual
antagonism; which of them is to gain and keep the upper hand in the
conflict depends on their relative powers of resistance.

if the tissues prevail, there ensues a process of repair. in the
immediate vicinity of the area of infection young connective tissue, and
later, fibrous tissue, is formed. this may replace the tuberculous
tissue and bring about repair--a fibrous cicatrix remaining to mark the
scene of the previous contest. scars of this nature are frequently
discovered at the apex of the lung after death in persons who have at
one time suffered from pulmonary phthisis. under other circumstances,
the tuberculous tissue that has undergone caseation, or even
calcification, is only encapsulated by the new fibrous tissue, like a
foreign body. although this may be regarded as a victory for the
tissues, the cure, if such it may be called, is not necessarily a
permanent one, for at any subsequent period, if the part affected is
disturbed by injury or through some other influence, the encapsulated
tubercle may again become active and get the upper hand of the tissues,
and there results a relapse or recrudescence of the disease. this
_tendency to relapse_ after apparent cure is a notable feature of
tuberculous disease as it is met with in the spine, or in the
hip-joint, and it necessitates a prolonged course of treatment to give
the best chance of a lasting cure.

if, however, at the inauguration of the tuberculous disease the bacilli
prevail, the infection tends to spread into the tissues surrounding
those originally infected, and more and more tuberculous granulation
tissue is formed. finally the tuberculous tissue breaks down and
liquefies, resulting in the formation of a cold abscess. in their
struggle with the tissues, tubercle bacilli receive considerable support
and assistance from any pyogenic organisms that may be present. a
tuberculous infection may exhibit its aggressive qualities in a more
serious manner by sending off detachments of bacilli, which are carried
by the lymphatics to the nearest glands, or by the blood-stream to more
distant, and it may be to all, parts of the body. when the infection is
thus generalised, the condition is called _general tuberculosis_.
considering the extraordinary frequency of localised forms of surgical
tuberculosis, general dissemination of the disease is rare.

#the clinical features# of surgical tuberculosis will be described with
the individual tissues and organs, as they vary widely according to the
situation of the lesion.

#the general treatment# consists in combating the adverse influences
that have been mentioned as increasing the liability to tuberculous
infection. within recent years the value of the "open-air" treatment has
been widely recognised. an open-air life, even in the centre of a city,
may be followed by marked improvement, especially in the hospital class
of patient, whose home surroundings tend to favour the progress of the
disease. the purer air of places away from centres of population is
still better; and, according to the idiosyncrasies of the individual
patient, mountain air or that of the sea coast may be preferred. in view
of the possible discomforts and gastric disturbance which may attend a
sea-voyage, this should be recommended to patients suffering from
tuberculous lesions with more caution than has hitherto been exercised.
the diet must be a liberal one, and should include those articles which
are at the same time easily digested and nourishing, especially proteids
and fats; milk obtained from a reliable source and underdone
butcher-meat are among the best. when the ordinary nourishment taken is
insufficient, it may be supplemented by such articles as malt extract,
stout, and cod-liver oil. the last is specially beneficial in patients
who do not take enough fat in other forms. it is noteworthy that many
tuberculous patients show an aversion to fat.

for _the use of tuberculin in diagnosis_ and for _the vaccine treatment
of tuberculosis_ the reader is referred to text-books on medicine.

in addition to increasing the resisting power of the patient, it is
important to enable the fluids of the body, so altered, to come into
contact with the tuberculous focus. one of the obstacles to this is that
the focus is often surrounded by tissues or fluids which have been
almost entirely deprived of bactericidal substances. in the case of
caseated glands in the neck, for example, it is obvious that the removal
of this inert material is necessary before the tissues can be irrigated
with fluids of high bactericidal value. again, in tuberculous ascites
the abdominal cavity is filled with a fluid practically devoid of
anti-bacterial substances, so that the bacilli are able to thrive and
work their will on the tissues. when the stagnant fluid is got rid of by
laparotomy, the parts are immediately douched with lymph charged with
protective substances, the bactericidal power of which may be many times
that of the fluid displaced.

it is probable that the beneficial influence of _counter-irritants_,
such as blisters, and exposure to the _finsen light_ and other forms of
_rays_, is to be attributed in part to the increased flow of blood to
the infected tissues.

_artificial hyperaemia._--as has been explained, the induction of
hyperaemia by the method devised by bier, constitutes one of our most
efficient means of combating bacterial infection. the treatment of
tuberculosis on this plan has been proved by experience to be a valuable
addition to our therapeutic measures, and the simplicity of its
application has led to its being widely adopted in practice. it results
in an increase in the reactive changes around the tuberculous focus, an
increase in the immigration of leucocytes, and infiltration with the
lymphocytes.

the constricting bandage should be applied at some distance above the
seat of infection; for instance, in disease of the wrist, it is put on
above the elbow, and it must not cause pain either where it is applied
or in the diseased part. the bandage is only applied for a few hours
each day, either two hours at a time or twice a day for one hour, and,
while it is on, all dressings are removed save a piece of sterile gauze
over any wound or sinus that may be present. the process of cure takes a
long time--nine or even twelve months in the case of a severe joint
affection.

in cases in which a constricting bandage is inapplicable, for example,
in cold abscesses, tuberculous glands or tendon sheaths, klapp's suction
bell is employed. the cup is applied for five minutes at a time and then
taken off for three minutes, and this is repeated over a period of
about three-quarters of an hour. the pus is allowed to escape by a small
incision, and no packing or drain should be introduced.

it has been found that tuberculous lesions tend to undergo cure
when the infected tissues are exposed to the rays of the
sun--_heliotherapy_--therefore whenever practicable this therapeutic
measure should be had recourse to.

since the introduction of the methods of treatment described above, and
especially by their employment at an early stage in the disease, the
number of cases of tuberculosis requiring operative interference has
greatly diminished. there are still circumstances, however, in which an
operation is required; for example, in disease of the lymph glands for
the removal of inert masses of caseous material, in disease of bone for
the removal of sequestra, or in disease of joints to improve the
function of the limb. it is to be understood, however, that operative
treatment must always be preceded by and combined with other therapeutic
measures.


tuberculous abscess

the caseation of tuberculous granulation tissue and its liquefaction is
a slow and insidious process, and is unattended with the classical signs
of inflammation--hence the terms "cold" and "chronic" applied to the
tuberculous abscess.

in a cold abscess, such as that which results from tuberculous disease
of the vertebrae, the clinical appearances are those of a soft, fluid
swelling without heat, redness, pain, or fever. when toxic symptoms are
present, they are usually due to a mixed infection.

a tuberculous abscess results from the disintegration and liquefaction
of tuberculous granulation tissue which has undergone caseation. fluid
and cells from the adjacent blood vessels exude into the cavity, and
lead to variations in the character of its contents. in some cases the
contents consist of a clear amber-coloured fluid, in which are suspended
fragments of caseated tissue; in others, of a white material like
cream-cheese. from the addition of a sufficient number of leucocytes,
the contents may resemble the pus of an ordinary abscess.

the wall of the abscess is lined with tuberculous granulation tissue,
the inner layers of which are undergoing caseation and disintegration,
and present a shreddy appearance; the outer layers consist of
tuberculous tissue which has not yet undergone caseation. the abscess
tends to increase in size by progressive liquefaction of the inner
layers, caseation of the outer layers, and the further invasion of the
surrounding tissues by tubercle bacilli. in this way a tuberculous
abscess is capable of indefinite extension and increase in size until it
reaches a free surface and ruptures externally. the direction in which
it spreads is influenced by the anatomical arrangement of the tissues,
and possibly to some extent by gravity, and the abscess may reach the
surface at a considerable distance from its seat of origin. the best
illustration of this is seen in the psoas abscess, which may originate
in the dorsal vertebrae, extend downwards within the sheath of the psoas
muscle, and finally appear in the thigh.

#clinical features.#--the insidious development of the tuberculous
abscess is one of its characteristic features. the swelling may attain a
considerable size without the patient being aware of its existence, and,
as a matter of fact, it is often discovered accidentally. the absence of
toxaemia is to be associated with the incapacity of the wall of the
abscess to permit of absorption; this is shown also by the fact that
when even a large quantity of iodoform is inserted into the cavity of
the abscess, there are no symptoms of poisoning. the abscess varies in
size from a small cherry to a cavity containing several pints of pus.
its shape also varies; it is usually that of a flattened sphere, but it
may present pockets or burrows running in various directions. sometimes
it is hour-glass or dumb-bell shaped, as is well illustrated in the
region of the groin in disease of the spine or pelvis, where there may
be a large sac occupying the venter ilii, and a smaller one in the
thigh, the two communicating by a narrow channel under poupart's
ligament. by pressing with the fingers the pus may be displaced from one
compartment to the other. the usual course of events is that the abscess
progresses slowly, and finally reaches a free surface--generally the
skin. as it does so there may be some pain, redness, and local elevation
of temperature. fluctuation becomes evident and superficial, and the
skin becomes livid and finally gives way. if the case is left to nature,
the discharge of pus continues, and the track opening on the skin
remains as a _sinus_. the persistence of suppuration is due to the
presence in the wall of the abscess and of the sinus, of tuberculous
granulation tissue, which, so long as it remains, continues to furnish
discharge, and so prevents healing. sooner or later pyogenic organisms
gain access to the sinus, and through it to the wall of the abscess.
they tend further to depress the resisting power of the tissues, and
thereby aggravate and perpetuate the tuberculous disease. this
superadded infection with pyogenic organisms exposes the patient to the
further risks of septic intoxication, especially in the form of hectic
fever and septicaemia, and increases the liability to general
tuberculosis, and to waxy degeneration of the internal organs. the mixed
infection is chiefly responsible for the pyrexia, sweating, and
emaciation which the laity associate with consumptive disease. a
tuberculous abscess may in one or other of these ways be a cause of
death.

_residual abscess_ is the name given to an abscess that makes its
appearance months, or even years, after the apparent cure of tuberculous
disease--as, for example, in the hip-joint or spine. it is called
residual because it has its origin in the remains of the original
disease.

[illustration: fig. 34.--tuberculous abscess in right lumbar region in a
woman aged thirty.]

#diagnosis.#--a cold abscess is to be diagnosed from a syphilitic gumma,
a cyst, and from lipoma and other soft tumours. the differential
diagnosis of these affections will be considered later; it is often made
easier by recognising the presence of a lesion that is likely to cause a
cold abscess, such as tuberculous disease of the spine or of the
sacro-iliac joint. when it is about to burst externally, it may be
difficult to distinguish a tuberculous abscess from one due to infection
with pyogenic organisms. even when the abscess is opened, the
appearances of the pus may not supply the desired information, and it
may be necessary to submit it to bacteriological examination. when the
pus is found to be sterile, it is usually safe to assume that the
condition is tuberculous, as in other forms of suppuration the causative
organisms can usually be recognised. experimental inoculation will
establish a definite diagnosis, but it implies a delay of two to three
weeks.

#treatment.#--the tuberculous abscess may recede and disappear under
general treatment. many surgeons advise that so long as the abscess is
quiescent it should be left alone. all agree, however, that if it shows
a tendency to spread, to increase in size, or to approach the skin or a
mucous membrane, something should be done to avoid the danger of its
bursting and becoming infected with pyogenic organisms. simple
evacuation of the abscess by a hollow needle may suffice, or bismuth or
iodoform may be introduced after withdrawal of the contents.

_evacuation of the abscess and injection of iodoform._--the iodoform is
employed in the form of a 10 per cent. solution in ether or the same
proportion suspended in glycerin. either form becomes sterile soon after
it is prepared. its curative effects would appear to depend upon the
liberation of iodine, which restrains the activity of the bacilli, and
upon its capacity for irritating the tissues and so inducing a
protective leucocytosis, and also of stimulating the formation of scar
tissue. an anaesthetic is rarely called for, except in children. the
abscess is first evacuated by means of a large trocar and cannula
introduced obliquely through the overlying soft parts, avoiding any part
where the skin is thin or red. if the cannula becomes blocked with
caseous material, it may be cleared with a probe, or a small quantity of
saline solution is forced in by the syringe. the iodoform is injected by
means of a glass-barrelled syringe, which is firmly screwed on to the
cannula. the amount injected varies with the size of the abscess and the
age of the patient; it may be said to range from two or three drams in
the case of children to several ounces in large abscesses in adults. the
cannula is withdrawn, the puncture is closed by a michel's clip, and a
dressing applied so as to exert a certain amount of compression. if the
abscess fills up again, the procedure should be repeated; in doing so,
the contents show the coloration due to liberated iodine. when the
contents are semi-solid, and cannot be withdrawn even through a large
cannula, an incision must be made, and, after the cavity has been
emptied, the iodoform is introduced through a short rubber tube attached
to the syringe. experience has shown that even large abscesses, such as
those associated with spinal disease, may be cured by iodoform
injection, and this even when rupture of the abscess on the skin surface
has appeared to be imminent.

another method of treatment which is less popular now than it used to
be, and which is chiefly applicable in abscesses of moderate size, is by
_incision of the abscess and removal of the tuberculous tissue in its
wall_ with the sharp spoon. an incision is made which will give free
access to the interior of the abscess, so that outlying pockets or
recesses may not be overlooked. after removal of the pus, the wall of
the abscess is scraped with the volkmann spoon or with barker's flushing
spoon, to get rid of the tuberculous tissue with which it is lined. in
using the spoon, care must be taken that its sharp edge does not
perforate the wall of a vein or other important structure. any debris
which may adhere to the walls is removed by rubbing with dry gauze. the
oozing of blood is arrested by packing the cavity for a few minutes with
gauze. after the packing is removed, iodoform powder is rubbed into the
raw surface. the soft parts divided by the incision are sutured in
layers so as to ensure primary union. if, on the other hand, there is
fear of a mixed infection, especially in abscesses near the rectum or
anus, it is safer to treat it by the open method, packing the cavity
with iodoform worsted or bismuth gauze, which is renewed at intervals of
a week or ten days as the cavity heals from the bottom.

another method is to incise the abscess, cleanse the cavity with gauze,
irrigate with carrel-dakin solution and pack with gauze smeared with the
dilute non-toxic b.i.p.p. (bismuth and iodoform 2 parts, vaseline 12
parts, hard paraffin, sufficient to give the consistence of butter). the
wound is closed with "bipped" silk sutures; one of these--the "waiting
suture"--is left loose to permit of withdrawal of the gauze after
forty-eight hours; the waiting suture is then tied, and delayed primary
union is thus effected.

when the skin over the abscess is red, thin, and about to give way, as
is frequently the case when the abscess is situated in the subcutaneous
cellular tissue, any skin which is undermined and infected with tubercle
should be removed with the scissors at the same time that the abscess is
dealt with.

in abscesses treated by the open method, when the cavity has become
lined with healthy granulations, it may be closed by secondary suture,
or, if the granulating surface is flush with the skin, healing may be
hastened by skin-grafting.

if the tuberculous abscess has burst and left a _sinus_, this is apt to
persist because of the presence of tuberculous tissue in its wall, and
of superadded pyogenic infection, or because it serves as an avenue for
the escape of discharge from a focus of tubercle in a bone or a lymph
gland.

[illustration: fig. 35.--tuberculous sinus injected through its opening
in the forearm with bismuth paste.

(mr. pirie watson's case--radiogram by dr. hope fowler.)]

the treatment varies with the conditions present, and must include
measures directed to the lesion from which the sinus has originated. the
extent and direction of any given sinus may be demonstrated by the use
of the probe, or, more accurately, by injecting the sinus with a paste
consisting of white vaseline containing 10 to 30 per cent. of bismuth
subcarbonate, and following its track with the x-rays (fig. 35).

it was found by beck of chicago that the injection of bismuth paste is
frequently followed by healing of the sinus, and that, if one injection
fails to bring about a cure, repeating the injection every second day
may be successful. some caution must be observed in this treatment, as
symptoms of poisoning have been observed to follow its use. if they
manifest themselves, an injection of warm olive oil should be given; the
oil, left in for twelve hours or so, forms an emulsion with the bismuth,
which can be withdrawn by aspiration. iodoform suspended in glycerin may
be employed in a similar manner. when these and other non-operative
measures fail, and the whole track of the sinus is accessible, it should
be laid open, scraped, and packed with bismuth or iodoform gauze until
it heals from the bottom.

the _tuberculous ulcer_ is described in the chapter on ulcers.

syphilis is an infective disease due to the entrance into the body of a
specific virus. it is nearly always communicated from one individual to
another by contact infection, the discharge from a syphilitic lesion
being the medium through which the virus is transmitted, and the seat of
inoculation is almost invariably a surface covered by squamous
epithelium. the disease was unknown in europe before the year 1493, when
it was introduced into spain by columbus' crew, who were infected in
haiti, where the disease had been endemic from time immemorial (bloch).

the granulation tissue which forms as a result of the reaction of the
tissues to the presence of the virus is chiefly composed of lymphocytes
and plasma cells, along with an abundant new formation of capillary
blood vessels. giant cells are not uncommon, but the endothelioid cells,
which are so marked a feature of tuberculous granulation tissue, are
practically absent.

when syphilis is communicated from one individual to another by contact
infection, the condition is spoken of as _acquired syphilis_, and the
first visible sign of the disease appears at the site of inoculation,
and is known as _the primary lesion_. those who have thus acquired the
disease may transmit it to their offspring, who are then said to suffer
from _inherited syphilis_.

#the virus of syphilis.#--the cause of syphilis, whether acquired or
inherited, is the organism, described by schaudinn and hoffman, in 1905,
under the name of _spirochaeta pallida_ or _spironema pallidum_. it is a
delicate, thread-like spirilla, in length averaging from 8 to 10 u and
in width about 0.25 u, and is distinguished from other spirochaetes by
its delicate shape, its dead-white appearance, together with its closely
twisted spiral form, with numerous undulations (10 to 26), which are
perfectly regular, and are characteristic in that they remain the same
during rest and in active movement (fig. 36). in a fresh specimen, such
as a scraping from a hard chancre suspended in a little salt solution,
it shows active movements. the organism is readily destroyed by heat,
and perishes in the absence of moisture. it has been proved
experimentally that it remains infective only up to six hours after its
removal from the body. noguchi has succeeded in obtaining pure cultures
from the infected tissues of the rabbit.

[illustration: fig. 36.--spirochaeta pallida from scraping of hard
chancre of prepuce. x 1000 diam. burri method.]

the spirochaete may be recognised in films made by scraping the deeper
parts of the primary lesion, from papules on the skin, or from blisters
artificially raised on lesions of the skin or on the immediately
adjacent portion of healthy skin. it is readily found in the mucous
patches and condylomata of the secondary period. it is best stained by
giemsa's method, and its recognition is greatly aided by the use of the
ultra-microscope.

the spirochaete has been demonstrated in every form of syphilitic lesion,
and has been isolated from the blood--with difficulty--and from lymph
withdrawn by a hollow needle from enlarged lymph glands. the saliva of
persons suffering from syphilitic lesions of the mouth also contains the
organism.

[illustration: fig. 37.--spirochaeta refrigerans from scraping of vagina.
x 1000 diam. burri method.]

in tertiary lesions there is greater difficulty in demonstrating the
spirochaete, but small numbers have been found in the peripheral parts of
gummata and in the thickened patches in syphilitic disease of the aorta.
noguchi and moore have discovered the spirochaete in the brain in a
number of cases of general paralysis of the insane. the spirochaete may
persist in the body for a long time after infection; its presence has
been demonstrated as long as sixteen years after the original
acquisition of the disease.

in inherited syphilis the spirochaete is present in enormous numbers
throughout all the organs and fluids of the body.

considerable interest attaches to the observations of metchnikoff, roux,
and neisser, who have succeeded in conveying syphilis to the chimpanzee
and other members of the ape tribe, obtaining primary and secondary
lesions similar to those observed in man, and also containing the
spirochaete. in animals the disease has been transmitted by material from
all kinds of syphilitic lesions, including even the blood in the
secondary and tertiary stages of the disease. the primary lesion is in
the form of an indurated papule, in every respect resembling the
corresponding lesion in man, and associated with enlargement and
induration of the lymph glands. the primary lesion usually appears about
thirty days after inoculation, to be followed, in about half the cases,
by secondary manifestations, which are usually of a mild character; in
no instance has any tertiary lesion been observed. the severity of the
affection amongst apes would appear to be in proportion to the nearness
of the relationship of the animal to the human subject. the eye of the
rabbit is also susceptible to inoculation from syphilitic lesions; the
material in a finely divided state is introduced into the anterior
chamber of the eye.

attempts to immunise against the disease have so far proved negative,
but metchnikoff has shown that the inunction of the part inoculated with
an ointment containing 33 per cent. of calomel, within one hour of
infection, suffices to neutralise the virus in man, and up to eighteen
hours in monkeys. he recommends the adoption of this procedure in the
prophylaxis of syphilis.

noguchi has made an emulsion of dead spirochaetes which he calls
_luetin_, and which gives a specific reaction resembling that of
tuberculin in tuberculosis, a papule or a pustule forming at the site of
the intra-dermal injection. it is said to be most efficacious in the
tertiary and latent forms of syphilis, which are precisely those forms
in which the diagnosis is surrounded with difficulties.


acquired syphilis

in the vast majority of cases, infection takes place during the congress
of the sexes. delicate, easily abraded surfaces are then brought into
contact, and the discharge from lesions containing the virus is placed
under favourable conditions for conveying the disease from one person to
the other. in the male the possibility of infection taking place is
increased if the virus is retained under cover of a long and tight
prepuce, and if there are abrasions on the surface with which it comes
in contact. the frequency with which infection takes place on the
genitals during sexual intercourse warrants syphilis being considered a
venereal disease, although there are other ways in which it may be
contracted.

some of these imply direct contact--such, for example, as kissing, the
digital examination of syphilitic patients by doctors or nurses, or
infection of the surgeon's fingers while operating upon a syphilitic
patient. in suckling, a syphilitic wet nurse may infect a healthy
infant, or a syphilitic infant may infect a healthy wet nurse. in other
cases the infection is by indirect contact, the virus being conveyed
through the medium of articles contaminated by a syphilitic
patient--such, for example, as surgical instruments, tobacco pipes, wind
instruments, table utensils, towels, or underclothing. physiological
secretions, such as saliva, milk, or tears, are not capable of
communicating the disease unless contaminated by discharge from a
syphilitic sore. while the saliva itself is innocuous, it can be, and
often is, contaminated by the discharge from mucous patches or other
syphilitic lesions in the mouth and throat, and is then a dangerous
medium of infection. unless these extra-genital sources of infection are
borne in mind, there is a danger of failing to recognise the primary
lesion of syphilis in unusual positions, such as the lip, finger, or
nipple. when the disease is thus acquired by innocent transfer, it is
known as _syphilis insontium_.

#stages or periods of syphilis.#--following the teaching of ricord, it
is customary to divide the life-history of syphilis into three periods
or stages, referred to, for convenience, as primary, secondary, and
tertiary. this division is to some extent arbitrary and artificial, as
the different stages overlap one another, and the lesions of one stage
merge insensibly into those of another. wide variations are met with in
the manifestations of the secondary stage, and histologically there is
no valid distinction to be drawn between secondary and tertiary lesions.

_the primary period_ embraces the interval that elapses between the
initial infection and the first constitutional manifestations,--roughly,
from four to eight weeks,--and includes the period of incubation, the
development of the primary sore, and the enlargement of the nearest
lymph glands.

_the secondary period_ varies in duration from one to two years, during
which time the patient is liable to suffer from manifestations which are
for the most part superficial in character, affecting the skin and its
appendages, the mucous membranes, and the lymph glands.

_the tertiary period_ has no time-limit except that it follows upon the
secondary, so that during the remainder of his life the patient is
liable to suffer from manifestations which may affect the deeper tissues
and internal organs as well as the skin and mucous membranes.

#primary syphilis.#--_the period of incubation_ represents the interval
that elapses between the occurrence of infection and the appearance of
the primary lesion at the site of inoculation. its limits may be stated
as varying from two to six weeks, with an average of from twenty-one to
twenty-eight days. while the disease is incubating, there is nothing to
show that infection has occurred.

_the primary lesion._--the incubation period having elapsed, there
appears at the site of inoculation a circumscribed area of infiltration
which represents the reaction of the tissues to the entrance of the
virus. the first appearance is that of a sharply defined papule, rarely
larger than a split pea. its surface is at first smooth and shiny, but
as necrosis of the tissue elements takes place in the centre, it becomes
concave, and in many cases the epithelium is shed, and an ulcer is
formed. such an ulcer has an elevated border, sharply cut edges, an
indurated base, and exudes a scanty serous discharge; its surface is at
first occupied by yellow necrosed tissue, but in time this is replaced
by smooth, pale-pink granulation tissue; finally, epithelium may spread
over the surface, and the ulcer heals. as a rule, the patient suffers
little discomfort, and may even be ignorant of the existence of the
lesion, unless, as a result of exposure to mechanical or septic
irritation, ulceration ensues, and the sore becomes painful and tender,
and yields a purulent discharge. the primary lesion may persist until
the secondary manifestations make their appearance, that is, for several
weeks.

it cannot be emphasised too strongly that the induration of the primary
lesion, which has obtained for it the name of "hard chancre," is its
most important characteristic. it is best appreciated when the sore is
grasped from side to side between the finger and thumb. the sensation on
grasping it has been aptly compared to that imparted by a nodule of
cartilage, or by a button felt through a layer of cloth. the evidence
obtained by touch is more valuable than that obtained by inspection, a
fact which is made use of in the recognition of _concealed
chancres_--that is, those which are hidden by a tight prepuce. the
induration is due not only to the dense packing of the connective-tissue
spaces with lymphocytes and plasma cells, but also to the formation of
new connective-tissue elements. it is most marked in chancres situated
in the furrow between the glans and the prepuce.

_in the male_, the primary lesion specially affects certain
_situations_, and the appearances vary with these: (1) on the inner
aspect of the prepuce, and in the fold between the prepuce and the
glans; in the latter situation the induration imparts a "collar-like"
rigidity to the prepuce, which is most apparent when it is rolled back
over the corona. (2) at the orifice of the prepuce the primary lesion
assumes the form of multiple linear ulcers or fissures, and as each of
these is attended with infiltration, the prepuce cannot be pulled
back--a condition known as _syphilitic phimosis_. (3) on the glans penis
the infiltration may be so superficial that it resembles a layer of
parchment, but if it invades the cavernous tissue there is a dense mass
of induration. (4) on the external aspect of the prepuce or on the skin
of the penis itself. (5) at either end of the torn fraenum, in the form
of a diamond-shaped ulcer raised above the surroundings. (6) in relation
to the meatus and canal of the urethra, in either of which situations
the swelling and induration may lead to narrowing of the urethra, so
that the urine is passed with pain and difficulty and in a minute
stream; stricture results only in the exceptional cases in which the
chancre has ulcerated and caused destruction of tissue. a chancre within
the orifice of the urethra is rare, and, being concealed from view, it
can only be recognised by the discharge from the meatus and by the
induration felt between the finger and thumb on palpating the urethra.

_in the female_, the primary lesion is not so typical or so easily
recognised as in men; it is usually met with on the labia; the
induration is rarely characteristic and does not last so long. the
primary lesion may take the form of condylomata. indurated oedema, with
brownish-red or livid discoloration of one or both labia, is diagnostic
of syphilis.

the hard chancre is usually solitary, but sometimes there are two or
more; when there are several, they are individually smaller than the
solitary chancre.

it is the exception for a hard chancre to leave a visible scar, hence,
in examining patients with a doubtful history of syphilis, little
reliance can be placed on the presence or absence of a scar on the
genitals. when the primary lesion has taken the form of an open ulcer
with purulent discharge, or has sloughed, there is a permanent scar.

_infection of the adjacent lymph glands_ is usually found to have taken
place by the time the primary lesion has acquired its characteristic
induration. several of the glands along poupart's ligament, on one or on
both sides, become enlarged, rounded, and indurated; they are usually
freely movable, and are rarely sensitive unless there is superadded
septic infection. the term _bullet-bubo_ has been applied to them, and
their presence is of great value in diagnosis. in a certain number of
cases, one of the main _lymph vessels_ on the dorsum of the penis is
transformed into a fibrous cord easily recognisable on palpation, and
when grasped between the fingers appears to be in size and consistence
not unlike the vas deferens.

_concealed chancre_ is the term applied when one or more chancres are
situated within the sac of a prepuce which cannot be retracted. if the
induration is well marked, the chancre can be palpated through the
prepuce, and is tender on pressure. as under these conditions it is
impossible for the patient to keep the parts clean, septic infection
becomes a prominent feature, the prepuce is oedematous and inflamed, and
there is an abundant discharge of pus from its orifice. it occasionally
happens that the infection assumes a virulent character and causes
sloughing of the prepuce--a condition known as _phagedaena_. the
discharge is then foul and blood-stained, and the prepuce becomes of a
dusky red or purple colour, and may finally slough, exposing the glans.

_extra-genital or erratic chancres_ (fig. 38).--erratic chancre is the
term applied by jonathan hutchinson to the primary lesion of syphilis
when it appears on parts of the body other than the genitals. it differs
in some respects from the hard chancre as met with on the penis; it is
usually larger, the induration is more diffused, and the enlarged glands
are softer and more sensitive. the glands in nearest relation to the
sore are those first affected, for example, the epitrochlear or axillary
glands in chancre of the finger; the submaxillary glands in chancre of
the lip or mouth; or the pre-auricular gland in chancre of the eyelid or
forehead. in consequence of their divergence from the typical chancre,
and of their being often met with in persons who, from age,
surroundings, or moral character, are unlikely subjects of venereal
disease, the true nature of erratic chancres is often overlooked until
the persistence of the lesion, its want of resemblance to anything else,
or the onset of constitutional symptoms, determines the diagnosis of
syphilis. a solitary, indolent sore occurring on the lip, eyelid,
finger, or nipple, which does not heal but tends to increase in size,
and is associated with induration and enlargement of the adjacent
glands, is most likely to be the primary lesion of syphilis.

eruption on forearm.[1]]

#the soft sore, soft chancre, or chancroid.#--the differential diagnosis
of syphilis necessitates the consideration of the _soft sore_, _soft
chancre_, or _chancroid_, which is also a common form of venereal
disease, and is due to infection with a virulent pus-forming bacillus,
first described by ducrey in 1889. ducrey's bacillus occurs in the form
of minute oval rods measuring about 1.5 u in length, which stain readily
with any basic aniline dye, but are quickly decolorised by gram's
method. they are found mixed with other organisms in the purulent
discharge from the sore, and are chiefly arranged in small groups or in
short chains. soft sores are always contracted by direct contact from
another individual, and the incubation period is a short one of from two
to five days. they are usually situated in the vicinity of the fraenum,
and, in women, about the labia minora or fourchette; they probably
originate in abrasions in these situations. they appear as pustules,
which are rapidly converted into small, acutely inflamed ulcers with
sharply cut, irregular margins, which bleed easily and yield an abundant
yellow purulent discharge. they are devoid of the induration of
syphilis, are painful, and nearly always multiple, reproducing
themselves in successive crops by auto-inoculation. soft sores are often
complicated by phimosis and balanitis, and they frequently lead to
infection of the glands in the groin. the resulting bubo is ill-defined,
painful, and tender, and suppuration occurs in about one-fourth of the
cases. the overlying skin becomes adherent and red, and suppuration
takes place either in the form of separate foci in the interior of the
individual glands, or around them; in the latter case, on incision, the
glands are found lying bathed in pus. ducrey's bacillus is found in pure
culture in the pus. sometimes other pyogenic organisms are superadded.
after the bubo has been opened the wound may take on the characters of a
soft sore.

_treatment._--soft sores heal rapidly when kept clean. if concealed
under a tight prepuce, an incision should be made along the dorsum to
give access to the sores. they should be washed with eusol, and dusted
with a mixture of one part iodoform and two parts boracic or salicylic
acid, or, when the odour of iodoform is objected to, of equal parts of
boracic acid and carbonate of zinc. immersion of the penis in a bath of
eusol for some hours daily is useful. the sore is then covered with a
piece of gauze kept in position by drawing the prepuce over it, or by a
few turns of a narrow bandage. sublimed sulphur frequently rubbed into
the sore is recommended by c. h. mills. if the sores spread in spite of
this, they should be painted with cocaine and then cauterised. when the
glands in the groin are infected, the patient must be confined to bed,
and a dressing impregnated with ichthyol and glycerin (10 per cent.)
applied; the repeated use of a suction bell is of great service.
harrison recommends aspiration of a bubonic abscess, followed by
injection of 1 in 20 solution of tincture of iodine into the cavity;
this is in turn aspirated, and then 1 or 2 c.c. of the solution injected
and left in. this is repeated as often as the cavity refills. it is
sometimes necessary to let the pus out by one or more small incisions
and continue the use of the suction bell.

_diagnosis of primary syphilis._--in cases in which there is a history
of an incubation period of from three to five weeks, when the sore is
indurated, persistent, and indolent, and attended with bullet-buboes in
the groin, the diagnosis of primary syphilis is not difficult. owing,
however, to the great importance of instituting treatment at the
earliest possible stage of the infection, an effort should be made to
establish the diagnosis without delay by demonstrating the spirochaete.
before any antiseptic is applied, the margin of the suspected sore is
rubbed with gauze, and the serum that exudes on pressure is collected
in a capillary tube and sent to a pathologist for microscopical
examination. a better specimen can sometimes be obtained by puncturing
an enlarged lymph gland with a hypodermic needle, injecting a few minims
of sterile saline solution and then aspirating the blood-stained fluid.

the wassermann test must not be relied upon for diagnosis in the early
stage, as it does not appear until the disease has become generalised
and the secondary manifestations are about to begin. the practice of
waiting in doubtful cases before making a diagnosis until secondary
manifestations appear is to be condemned.

extra-genital chancres, _e.g._ sores on the fingers of doctors or
nurses, are specially liable to be overlooked, if the possibility of
syphilis is not kept in mind.

it is important to bear in mind _the possibility of a patient having
acquired a mixed infection_ with the virus of soft chancre, which will
manifest itself a few days after infection, and the virus of syphilis,
which shows itself after an interval of several weeks. this occurrence
was formerly the source of much confusion in diagnosis, and it was
believed at one time that syphilis might result from soft sores, but it
is now established that syphilis does not follow upon soft sores unless
the virus of syphilis has been introduced at the same time. the
practitioner must be on his guard, therefore, when a patient asks his
advice concerning a venereal sore which has appeared within a few days
of exposure to infection. such a patient is naturally anxious to know
whether he has contracted syphilis or not, but neither a positive nor a
negative answer can be given--unless the spirochaete can be identified.

syphilis is also to be diagnosed from _epithelioma_, the common form of
cancer of the penis. it is especially in elderly patients with a tight
prepuce that the induration of syphilis is liable to be mistaken for
that associated with epithelioma. in difficult cases the prepuce must be
slit open.

difficulty may occur in the diagnosis of primary syphilis from _herpes_,
as this may appear as late as ten days after connection; it commences as
a group of vesicles which soon burst and leave shallow ulcers with a
yellow floor; these disappear quickly on the use of an antiseptic
dusting powder.

apprehensive patients who have committed sexual indiscretions are apt to
regard as syphilitic any lesion which happens to be located on the
penis--for example, acne pustules, eczema, psoriasis papules, boils,
balanitis, or venereal warts.

_the local treatment_ of the primary sore consists in attempting to
destroy the organisms _in situ_. an ointment made up of calomel 33
parts, lanoline 67 parts, and vaseline 10 parts (metchnikoff's cream) is
rubbed into the sore several times a day. if the surface is unbroken, it
may be dusted lightly with a powder composed of equal parts of calomel
and carbonate of zinc. a gauze dressing is applied, and the penis and
scrotum should be supported against the abdominal wall by a triangular
handkerchief or bathing-drawers; if there is inflammatory oedema the
patient should be confined to bed.

in _concealed chancres_ with phimosis, the sac of the prepuce should be
slit up along the dorsum to admit of the ointment being applied. if
phagedaena occurs, the prepuce must be slit open along the dorsum, or if
sloughing, cut away, and the patient should have frequent sitz baths of
weak sublimate lotion. when the chancre is within the meatus, iodoform
bougies are inserted into the urethra, and the urine should be rendered
bland by drinking large quantities of fluid.

general treatment is considered on p. 149.

#secondary syphilis.#--the following description of secondary syphilis
is based on the average course of the disease in untreated cases. the
onset of constitutional symptoms occurs from six to twelve weeks after
infection, and the manifestations are the result of the entrance of the
virus into the general circulation, and its being carried to all parts
of the body. the period during which the patient is liable to suffer
from secondary symptoms ranges from six months to two years.

in some cases the general health is not disturbed; in others the patient
is feverish and out of sorts, losing appetite, becoming pale and anaemic,
complaining of lassitude, incapacity for exertion, headache, and pains
of a rheumatic type referred to the bones. there is a moderate degree of
leucocytosis, but the increase is due not to the polymorpho-nuclear
leucocytes but to lymphocytes. in isolated cases the temperature rises
to 101 o or 102 o f. and the patient loses flesh. the lymph glands,
particularly those along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid,
become enlarged and slightly tender. the hair comes out, eruptions
appear on the skin and mucous membranes, and the patient may suffer from
sore throat and affections of the eyes. the local lesions are to be
regarded as being of the nature of reactions against accumulations of
the parasite, lymphocytes and plasma cells being the elements chiefly
concerned in the reactive process.

_affections of the skin_ are among the most constant manifestations. an
evanescent macular rash, not unlike that of measles--_roseola_--is the
first to appear, usually in from six to eight weeks from the date of
infection; it is widely diffused over the trunk, and the original dull
rose-colour soon fades, leaving brownish stains, which in time
disappear. it is usually followed by a _papular eruption_, the
individual papules being raised above the surface of the skin, smooth or
scaly, and as they are due to infiltration of the skin they are more
persistent than the roseoles. they vary in size and distribution, being
sometimes small, hard, polished, and closely aggregated like lichen,
sometimes as large as a shilling-piece, with an accumulation of scales
on the surface like that seen in psoriasis. the co-existence of scaly
papules and faded roseoles is very suggestive of syphilis.

other types of eruption are less common, and are met with from the third
month onwards. a _pustular_ eruption, not unlike that of acne, is
sometimes a prominent feature, but is not characteristic of syphilis
unless it affects the scalp and forehead and is associated with the
remains of the papular eruption. the term _ecthyma_ is applied when the
pustules are of large size, and, after breaking on the surface, give
rise to superficial ulcers; the discharge from the ulcer often dries up
and forms a scab or crust which is continually added to from below as
the ulcer extends in area and depth. the term _rupia_ is applied when
the crusts are prominent, dark in colour, and conical in shape, roughly
resembling the shell of a limpet. if the crust is detached, a sharply
defined ulcer is exposed, and when this heals it leaves a scar which is
usually circular, thin, white, shining like satin, and the surrounding
skin is darkly pigmented; in the case of deep ulcers, the scar is
depressed and adherent (fig. 39).

[illustration: fig. 39.--syphilitic rupia, showing the limpet-shaped
crusts or scabs.]

in the later stages there may occur a form of creeping or _spreading
ulceration of the skin_ of the face, groin, or scrotum, healing at one
edge and spreading at another like tuberculous lupus, but distinguished
from this by its more rapid progress and by the pigmentation of the
scar.

_condylomata_ are more characteristic of syphilis than any other type of
skin lesion. they are papules occurring on those parts of the body where
the skin is habitually moist, and especially where two skin surfaces are
in contact. they are chiefly met with on the external genitals,
especially in women, around the anus, beneath large pendulous mammae,
between the toes, and at the angles of the mouth, and in these
situations their development is greatly favoured by neglect of
cleanliness. they present the appearance of well-defined circular or
ovoid areas in which the skin is thickened and raised above the surface;
they are covered with a white sodden epidermis, and furnish a scanty but
very infective discharge. under the influence of irritation and want of
rest, as at the anus or at the angle of the mouth, they are apt to
become fissured and superficially ulcerated, and the discharge then
becomes abundant and may crust on the surface, forming yellow scabs. at
the angle of the mouth the condylomatous patches may spread to the
cheek, and when they ulcerate may leave fissure-like scars radiating
from the mouth--an appearance best seen in inherited syphilis (fig. 44).

_the appendages of the skin._--the _hair_ loses its gloss, becomes dry
and brittle, and readily falls out, either as an exaggeration of the
normal shedding of the hair, or in scattered areas over the scalp
(_syphilitic alopoecia_). the hair is not re-formed in the scars which
result from ulcerated lesions of the scalp. the _nail-folds_
occasionally present a pustular eruption and superficial ulceration, to
which the name _syphilitic onychia_ has been applied; more commonly the
nails become brittle and ragged, and they may even be shed.

_the mucous membranes_, and especially those of the _mouth_ and
_throat_, suffer from lesions similar to those met with on the skin. on
a mucous surface the papular eruption assumes the form of _mucous
patches_, which are areas with a congested base covered with a thin
white film of sodden epithelium like wet tissue-paper. they are best
seen on the inner aspect of the cheeks, the soft palate, uvula, pillars
of the fauces, and tonsils. in addition to mucous patches, there may be
a number of small, _superficial, kidney-shaped ulcers_, especially along
the margins of the tongue and on the tonsils. in the absence of mucous
patches and ulcers, the sore throat may be characterised by a bluish
tinge of the inflamed mucous membrane and a thin film of shed epithelium
on the surface. sometimes there is an elongated sinuous film which has
been likened to the track of a snail. in the _larynx_ the presence of
congestion, oedema, and mucous patches may be the cause of persistent
hoarseness. the _tongue_ often presents a combination of lesions,
including ulcers, patches where the papillae are absent, fissures, and
raised white papules resembling warts, especially towards the centre of
the dorsum. these lesions are specially apt to occur in those who smoke,
drink undiluted alcohol or spirits, or eat hot condiments to excess, or
who have irregular, sharp-cornered teeth. at a later period, and in
those who are broken down in health from intemperance or other cause,
the sore throat may take the form of rapidly spreading, penetrating
ulcers in the soft palate and pillars of the fauces, which may lead to
extensive destruction of tissue, with subsequent scars and deformity
highly characteristic of previous syphilis.

in the _bones_, lesions occur which assume the clinical features of an
evanescent periostitis, the patient complaining of nocturnal pains over
the frontal bone, sternum, tibiae, and ulnae, and localised tenderness on
tapping over these bones.

in the _joints_, a serous synovitis or hydrops may occur, chiefly in the
knee, on one or on both sides.

_the affections of the eyes_, although fortunately rare, are of great
importance because of the serious results which may follow if they are
not recognised and treated. _iritis_ is the commonest of these, and may
occur in one or in both eyes, one after the other, from three to eight
months after infection. the patient complains of impairment of sight and
of frontal or supraorbital pain. the eye waters and is hypersensitive,
the iris is discoloured and reacts sluggishly to light, and there is a
zone of ciliary congestion around the cornea. the appearance of minute
white nodules or flakes of lymph at the margin of the pupil is
especially characteristic of syphilitic iritis. when adhesions have
formed between the iris and the structures in relation to it, the pupil
dilates irregularly under atropin. although complete recovery is to be
expected under early and energetic treatment, if neglected, _iritis_ may
result in occlusion of the pupil and permanent impairment or loss of
sight.

the other lesions of the eye are much rarer, and can only be discovered
on ophthalmoscopic examination.

the virus of syphilis exerts a special influence upon the _blood
vessels_, exciting a proliferation of the endothelial lining which
results in narrowing of their lumen, _endarteritis_, and a perivascular
infiltration in the form of accumulations of plasma cells around the
vessels and in the lymphatics that accompany them.

in the _brain_, in the later periods of secondary and in tertiary
syphilis, changes occur as a result of the narrowing of the lumen of the
arteries, or of their complete obliteration by thrombosis. by
interfering with the nutrition of those parts of the brain supplied by
the affected arteries, these lesions give rise to clinical features of
which severe headache and paralysis are the most prominent.

affections of the _spinal cord_ are extremely rare, but paraplegia from
myelitis has been observed.

lastly, attention must be directed to the remarkable variations observed
in different patients. sometimes the virulent character of the disease
can only be accounted for by an idiosyncrasy of the patient.
constitutional symptoms, particularly pyrexia and anaemia, are most often
met with in young women. patients over forty years of age have greater
difficulty in overcoming the infection than younger adults. malarial and
other infections, and the conditions attending life in tropical
countries, from the debility which they cause, tend to aggravate and
prolong the disease, which then assumes the characters of what has been
called _malignant syphilis_. all chronic ailments have a similar
influence, and alcoholic intemperance is universally regarded as a
serious aggravating factor.

_diagnosis of secondary syphilis._--a routine examination should be made
of the parts of the body which are most often affected in this
disease--the scalp, mouth, throat, posterior cervical glands, and the
trunk, the patient being stripped and examined by daylight. among the
_diagnostic features of the skin affections_ the following may be
mentioned: they are frequently, and sometimes to a marked degree,
symmetrical; more than one type of eruption--papules and pustules, for
example--are present at the same time; there is little itching; they are
at first a dull-red colour, but later present a brown pigmentation which
has been likened to the colour of raw ham; they exhibit a predilection
for those parts of the forehead and neck which are close to the roots of
the hair; they tend to pass off spontaneously; and they disappear
rapidly under treatment.

#serum diagnosis--wassermann reaction.#--wassermann found that if an
extract of syphilitic liver rich in spirochaetes is mixed with the serum
from a syphilitic patient, a large amount of complement is fixed. the
application of the test is highly complicated and can only be carried
out by an expert pathologist. for the purpose he is supplied with from 5
c.c. to 10 c.c. of the patient's blood, withdrawn under aseptic
conditions from the median basilic vein by means of a serum syringe, and
transferred to a clean and dry glass tube. there is abundant evidence
that the wassermann test is a reliable means of establishing a diagnosis
of syphilis.

a definitely positive reaction can usually be obtained between the
fifteenth and thirtieth day after the appearance of the primary lesion,
and as time goes on it becomes more marked. during the secondary period
the reaction is practically always positive. in the tertiary stage also
it is positive except in so far as it is modified by the results of
treatment. in para-syphilitic lesions such as general paralysis and
tabes a positive reaction is almost always present. in inherited
syphilis the reaction is positive in every case. a positive reaction may
be present in other diseases, for example, frambesia, trypanosomiasis,
and leprosy.

as the presence of the reaction is an evidence of the activity of the
spirochaetes, repeated applications of the test furnish a valuable means
of estimating the efficacy of treatment. the object aimed at is to
change a persistently positive reaction to a permanently negative one.

#treatment of syphilis.#--in the treatment of syphilis the two main
objects are to maintain the general health at the highest possible
standard, and to introduce into the system therapeutic agents which will
inhibit or destroy the invading parasite.

the second of these objects has been achieved by the researches of
ehrlich, who, in conjunction with his pupil, hata, has built up a
compound, the dihydrochloride of dioxydiamido-arseno-benzol, popularly
known as salvarsan or "606." other preparations, such as kharsivan,
arseno-billon, and diarsenol, are chemically equivalent to salvarsan,
containing from 27 to 31 per cent. of arsenic, and are equally
efficient. the full dose is 0.6 grm. all these members of the "606"
group form an acid solution when dissolved in water, and must be
rendered alkaline before being injected. as subcutaneous and
intra-muscular injections cause considerable pain, and may cause
sloughing of the tissues, "606" preparations must be injected
intravenously. ehrlich has devised a preparation--neo-salvarsan, or
"914," which is more easily prepared and forms a neutral solution. it
contains from 18 to 20 per cent. of arsenic. neo-kharsivan,
novo-arseno-billon, and neo-diarsenol belong to the "914" group, the
full dosage of which is 0.9 grm. as subcutaneous and intra-muscular
injections of the "914" group are not painful, and even more efficient
than intravenous injections, the administration is simpler.

galyl, luargol, and other preparations act in the same way as the "606"
and "914" groups.

the "606" preparations may be introduced into the veins by injection or
by means of an apparatus which allows the solution to flow in by
gravity. the left median basilic vein is selected, and a platino-iridium
needle with a short point and a bore larger than that of the ordinary
hypodermic syringe is used. the needle is passed for a few millimetres
along the vein, and the solution is then slowly introduced; before
withdrawing the needle some saline is run in to diminish the risk of
thrombosis.

the "914" preparations may be injected either into the subcutaneous
tissue of the buttock or into the substance of the gluteus muscle. the
part is then massaged for a few minutes, and the massage is repeated
daily for a few days.

no hard-and-fast rules can be laid down as to what constitutes a
complete course of treatment. harrison recommends as a _minimum_ course
of one of the "914" preparations in _early primary cases_ an initial
dose of 0.45 grm. given intra-muscularly or into the deep subcutaneous
tissue; the same dose a week later; 0.6 grm. the following week; then
miss a week and give 9.6 grms. on two successive weeks; then miss two
weeks and give 0.6 grm. on two more successive weeks.

when a _positive wassermann reaction_ is present before treatment is
commenced, the above course is prolonged as follows: for three weeks is
given a course of potassium iodide, after which four more weekly
injections of 0.6 grm. of "914" are given.

with each injection of "914" after the first, throughout the whole
course 1 grain of mercury is injected intra-muscularly.

in the course of a few hours, there is usually some indisposition, with
a feeling of chilliness and slight rise of temperature; these symptoms
pass off within twenty-four hours, and in a few days there is a decided
improvement of health. three or four days after an intra-muscular
injection there may be pain and stiffness in the gluteal region.

these preparations are the most efficient therapeutic agents that have
yet been employed in the treatment of syphilis.

the manifestations of the disease disappear with remarkable rapidity.
observations show that the spirochaetes lose their capacity for movement
within an hour or two of the administration, and usually disappear
altogether in from twenty-four to thirty-six hours. wassermann's
reaction usually yields a negative result in from three weeks to two
months, but later may again become positive. subsequent doses of the
arsenical preparation are therefore usually indicated, and should be
given in from 7 to 21 days according to the dose.

when syphilis occurs in a _pregnant woman_, she should be given in the
early months an ordinary course of "914," followed by 10-grain doses of
potassium iodide twice daily. the injections may be repeated two months
later, and during the remainder of the pregnancy 2-grain mercury pills
are given twice daily (a. campbell). the presence of albumen in the
urine contra-indicates arsenical treatment.

it need scarcely be pointed out that the use of powerful drugs like
"606" and "914" is not free from risk; it may be mentioned that each
dose contains nearly three grains of arsenic. before the administration
the patient must be overhauled; its administration is contra-indicated
in the presence of disease of the heart and blood vessels, especially a
combination of syphilitic aortitis and sclerosis of the coronary
arteries, with degeneration of the heart muscle; in affections of the
central nervous system, especially advanced paralysis, and in such
disturbances of metabolism as are associated with diabetes and bright's
disease. its use is not contra-indicated in any lesion of active
syphilis.

the administration is controlled by the systematic examination of the
urine for arsenic.

_the administration of mercury._--the success of the arsenical
preparations has diminished the importance of mercury in the treatment
of syphilis, but it is still used to supplement the effect of the
injections. the amount of mercury to be given in any case must be
proportioned to the idiosyncrasies of the patient, and it is advisable,
before commencing the treatment, to test his urine and record his
body-weight. the small amount of mercury given at the outset is
gradually increased. if the body-weight falls, or if the gums become
sore and the breath foul, the mercury should be stopped for a time. if
salivation occurs, the drinking of hot water and the taking of hot baths
should be insisted upon, and half-dram doses of the alkaline sulphates
prescribed.

_methods of administering mercury._--(1) _by the mouth._--this was for
long the most popular method in this country, the preparation usually
employed being grey powder, in pills or tablets, each of which contains
one grain of the powder. three of these are given daily in the first
instance, and the daily dose is increased to five or even seven grains
till the standard for the individual patient is arrived at. as the grey
powder alone sometimes causes irritation of the bowels, it should be
combined with iron, as in the following formula: hydrarg. c. cret. gr. 1;
ferri sulph. exsiccat. gr. 1 or 2.

(2) _by inunction._--inunction consists in rubbing into the pores of the
skin an ointment composed of equal parts of 20 per cent. oleate of
mercury and lanolin. every night after a hot bath, a dram of the
ointment (made up by the chemist in paper packets) is rubbed for fifteen
minutes into the skin where it is soft and comparatively free from
hairs. when the patient has been brought under the influence of the
mercury, inunction may be replaced by one of the other methods, of
administering the drug.

(3) _by intra-muscular injection._--this consists in introducing the
drug by means of a hypodermic syringe into the substance of the gluteal
muscles. the syringe is made of glass, and has a solid glass piston; the
needle of platino-iridium should be 5 cm. long and of a larger calibre
than the ordinary hypodermic needle. the preparation usually employed
consists of: metallic mercury or calomel 1 dram, lanolin and olive oil
each 2 drams; it must be warmed to allow of its passage through the
needle. five minims--containing one grain of metallic mercury--represent
a dose, and this is injected into the muscles above and behind the great
trochanter once a week. the contents of the syringe are slowly
expressed, and, after withdrawing the needle, gentle massage of the
buttock should be employed. four courses each of ten injections are
given the first year, three courses of the same number during the second
and third years, and two courses during the fourth year (lambkin).

_the general health._--the patient must lead a regular life and
cultivate the fresh-air habit, which is as beneficial in syphilis as in
tuberculosis. anaemia, malaria, and other sources of debility must
receive appropriate treatment. the diet should be simple and easily
digested, and should include a full supply of milk. alcohol is
prohibited. the excretory organs are encouraged to act by the liberal
drinking of hot water between meals, say five or six tumblerfuls in the
twenty-four hours. the functions of the skin are further aided by
frequent hot baths, and by the wearing of warm underclothing. while the
patient should avoid exposure to cold, and taxing his energies by undue
exertion, he should be advised to take exercise in the open air. on
account of the liability to lesions of the mouth and throat, he should
use tobacco in moderation, his teeth should be thoroughly overhauled by
the dentist, and he should brush them after every meal, using an
antiseptic tooth powder or wash. the mouth and throat should be rinsed
out night and morning with a solution of chlorate of potash and alum, or
with peroxide of hydrogen.

_treatment of the local manifestations._--_the skin lesions_ are treated
on the same lines as similar eruptions of other origin. as local
applications, preparations of mercury are usually selected, notably the
ointments of the red oxide of mercury, ammoniated mercury, or oleate of
mercury (5 per cent.), or the mercurial plaster introduced by unna. in
the treatment of condylomata the greatest attention must be paid to
cleanliness and dryness. after washing and drying the affected patches,
they are dusted with a powder consisting of equal parts of calomel and
carbonate of zinc; and apposed skin surfaces, such as the nates or
labia, are separated by sublimate wool. in the ulcers of later secondary
syphilis, crusts are got rid of in the first instance by means of a
boracic poultice, after which a piece of lint or gauze cut to the size
of the ulcer and soaked in black wash is applied and covered with
oil-silk. if the ulcer tends to spread in area or in depth, it should be
scraped with a sharp spoon, and painted over with acid nitrate of
mercury, or a local hyperaemia may be induced by klapp's suction
apparatus.

_in lesions of the mouth and throat_, the teeth should be attended to;
the best local application is a solution of chromic acid--10 grains to
the ounce--painted on with a brush once daily. if this fails, the
lesions may be dusted with calomel the last thing at night. for deep
ulcers of the throat the patient should gargle frequently with chlorine
water or with perchloride of mercury (1 in 2000); if the ulcer continues
to spread it should be painted with acid nitrate of mercury.

in the treatment of _iritis_ the eyes are shaded from the light and
completely rested, and the pupil is well dilated by atropin to prevent
adhesions. if there is much pain, a blister may be applied to the
temple.

_the relations of syphilis to marriage._--before the introduction of the
ehrlich-hata treatment no patient was allowed to marry until three years
had elapsed after the disappearance of the last manifestation. while
marriage might be entered upon under these conditions without risk of
the husband infecting the wife, the possibility of his conveying the
disease to the offspring cannot be absolutely excluded. it is
recommended, as a precautionary measure, to give a further mercurial
course of two or three months' duration before marriage, and an
intravenous injection of an arsenical preparation.

#intermediate stage.#--after the dying away of the secondary
manifestations and before the appearance of tertiary lesions, the
patient may present certain symptoms which hutchinson called
_reminders_. these usually consist of relapses of certain of the
affections of the skin, mouth, or throat, already described. in the
skin, they may assume the form of peeling patches in the palms, or may
appear as spreading and confluent circles of a scaly papular eruption,
which if neglected may lead to the formation of fissures and superficial
ulcers. less frequently there is a relapse of the eye affections, or of
paralytic symptoms from disease of the cerebral arteries.

#tertiary syphilis.#--while the manifestations of primary and secondary
syphilis are common, those of the tertiary period are by comparison
rare, and are observed chiefly in those who have either neglected
treatment or who have had their powers of resistance lowered by
privation, by alcoholic indulgence, or by tropical disease.

it is to be borne in mind that in a certain proportion of men and in a
larger proportion of women, the patient has no knowledge of having
suffered from syphilis. certain slight but important signs may give the
clue in a number of cases, such as irregularity of the pupils or failure
to react to light, abnormality of the reflexes, and the discovery of
patches of leucoplakia on the tongue, cheek, or palate.

the _general character of tertiary manifestations_ may be stated as
follows: they attack by preference the tissues derived from the
mesoblastic layer of the embryo--the cellular tissue, bones, muscles,
and viscera. they are often localised to one particular tissue or organ,
such, for example, as the subcutaneous cellular tissue, the bones, or
the liver, and they are rarely symmetrical. they are usually aggressive
and persistent, with little tendency to natural cure, and they may be
dangerous to life, because of the destructive changes produced in such
organs as the brain or the larynx. they are remarkably amenable to
treatment if instituted before the stage which is attended with
destruction of tissue is reached. early tertiary lesions may be
infective, and the disease may be transmitted by the discharges from
them; but the later the lesions the less is the risk of their containing
an infective virus.

the most prominent feature of tertiary syphilis consists in the
formation of granulation tissue, and this takes place on a scale
considerably larger than that observed in lesions of the secondary
period. the granulation tissue frequently forms a definite swelling or
tumour-like mass (syphiloma), which, from its peculiar elastic
consistence, is known as a _gumma_. in its early stages a gumma is a
firm, semi-translucent greyish or greyish-red mass of tissue; later it
becomes opaque, yellow, and caseous, with a tendency to soften and
liquefy. the gumma does harm by displacing and replacing the normal
tissue elements of the part affected, and by involving these in the
degenerative changes, of the nature of caseation and necrosis, which
produce the destructive lesions of the skin, mucous membranes, and
internal organs. this is true not only of the circumscribed gumma, but
of the condition known as _gummatous infiltration_ or _syphilitic
cirrhosis_, in which the granulation tissue is diffused throughout the
connective-tissue framework of such organs as the tongue or liver. both
the gummatous lesions and the fibrosis of tertiary syphilis are directly
excited by the spirochaetes.

the life-history of an untreated gumma varies with its environment. when
protected from injury and irritation in the substance of an internal
organ such as the liver, it may become encapsulated by fibrous tissue,
and persist in this condition for an indefinite period, or it may be
absorbed and leave in its place a fibrous cicatrix. in the interior of a
long bone it may replace the rigid framework of the shaft to such an
extent as to lead to pathological fracture. if it is near the surface of
the body--as, for example, in the subcutaneous or submucous cellular
tissue, or in the periosteum of a superficial bone, such as the palate,
the skull, or the tibia--the tissue of which it is composed is apt to
undergo necrosis, in which the overlying skin or mucous membrane
frequently participates, the result being an ulcer--the tertiary
syphilitic ulcer (figs. 40 and 41).

_tertiary lesions of the skin and subcutaneous cellular tissue._--the
clinical features of a _subcutaneous gumma_ are those of an indolent,
painless, elastic swelling, varying in size from a pea to an almond or
walnut. after a variable period it usually softens in the centre, the
skin over it becomes livid and dusky, and finally separates as a slough,
exposing the tissue of the gumma, which sometimes appears as a mucoid,
yellowish, honey-like substance, more frequently as a sodden, caseated
tissue resembling wash-leather. the caseated tissue of a gumma differs
from that of a tuberculous lesion in being tough and firm, of a buff
colour like wash-leather, or whitish, like boiled fish. the degenerated
tissue separates slowly and gradually, and in untreated cases may be
visible for weeks in the floor of the ulcer.

[illustration: fig. 40.--ulcerating gumma of lips.

(from a photograph lent by dr. stopford taylor and dr. r. w. mackenna.)]

_the tertiary ulcer_ may be situated anywhere, but is most frequently
met with on the leg, especially in the region of the knee (fig. 42) and
over the calf. there may be one or more ulcers, and also scars of
antecedent ulcers. the edges are sharply cut, as if punched out; the
margins are rounded in outline, firm, and congested; the base is
occupied by gummatous tissue, or, if this has already separated and
sloughed out, by unhealthy granulations and a thick purulent discharge.
when the ulcer has healed it leaves a scar which is depressed, and if
over a bone, is adherent to it. the features of the tertiary ulcer,
however, are not always so characteristic as the above description would
imply. it is to be diagnosed from the "leg ulcer," which occurs almost
exclusively on the lower third of the leg; from bazin's disease (p. 74);
from the ulcers that result from certain forms of malignant disease,
such as rodent cancer, and from those met with in chronic glanders.

_gummatous infiltration of the skin_ ("syphilitic lupus").--this is a
lesion, met with chiefly on the face and in the region of the external
genitals, in which the skin becomes infiltrated with granulation tissue
so that it is thickened, raised above the surface, and of a brownish-red
colour. it appears as isolated nodules, which may fuse together; the
epidermis becomes scaly and is shed, giving rise to superficial ulcers
which are usually covered by crusted discharge. the disease tends to
spread, creeping over the skin with a serpiginous, crescentic, or
horse-shoe margin, while the central portion may heal and leave a scar.
from the fact of its healing in the centre while it spreads at the
margin, it may resemble tuberculous disease of the skin. it can usually
be differentiated by observing that the infiltration is on a larger
scale; the progress is much more rapid, involving in the course of
months an area which in the case of tuberculosis would require as many
years; the scars are sounder and are less liable to break down again;
and the disease rapidly yields to anti-syphilitic treatment.

[illustration: fig. 41.--ulceration of nineteen year's duration
in a woman aet. 24, the subject of inherited syphilis, showing active
ulceration, cicatricial contraction, and sabre-blade deformity of
tibiae.]

_tertiary lesions of mucous membrane and of the submucous cellular
tissue_ are met with chiefly in the tongue, nose, throat, larynx, and
rectum. they originate as gummata or as gummatous infiltrations, which
are liable to break down and lead to the formation of ulcers which may
prove locally destructive, and, in such situations as the larynx, even
dangerous to life. in the tongue the tertiary ulcer may prove the
starting-point of cancer; and in the larynx or rectum the healing of the
ulcer may lead to cicatricial stenosis.

tertiary lesions of the _bones and joints_, of the _muscles_, and of the
_internal organs_, will be described under these heads. the part played
by syphilis in the production of disease of arteries and of aneurysm
will be referred to along with diseases of blood vessels.

[illustration: fig. 42.--tertiary syphilitic ulceration in region of
knee and on both thumbs of woman aet. 37.]

_treatment._--the most valuable drugs for the treatment of the
manifestations of the tertiary period are the arsenical preparations and
the iodides of sodium and potassium. on account of their depressing
effects, the latter are frequently prescribed along with carbonate of
ammonium. the dose is usually a matter of experiment in each individual
case; 5 grains three times a day may suffice, or it may be necessary to
increase each dose to 20 or 25 grains. the symptoms of iodism which may
follow from the smaller doses usually disappear on giving a larger
amount of the drug. it should be taken after meals, with abundant water
or other fluid, especially if given in tablet form. it is advisable to
continue the iodides for from one to three months after the lesions for
which they are given have cleared up. if the potassium salt is not
tolerated, it may be replaced by the ammonium or sodium iodide.

_local treatment._--the absorption of a subcutaneous gumma is often
hastened by the application of a fly-blister. when a gumma has broken on
the surface and caused an ulcer, this is treated on general principles,
with a preference, however, for applications containing mercury or
iodine, or both. if a wet dressing is required to cleanse the ulcer,
black wash may be used; if a powder to promote dryness, one containing
iodoform; if an ointment is indicated, the choice lies between the red
oxide of mercury or the dilute nitrate of mercury ointment, and one
consisting of equal parts of lanolin and vaselin with 2 per cent. of
iodine. deep ulcers, and obstinate lesions of the bones, larynx, and
other parts may be treated by excision or scraping with the sharp spoon.

#second attacks of syphilis.#--instances of re-infection of syphilis
have been recorded with greater frequency since the more general
introduction of arsenical treatment. a remarkable feature in such cases
is the shortness of the interval between the original infection and the
alleged re-infection; in a recent series of twenty-eight cases, this
interval was less than a year. another feature of interest is that when
patients in the tertiary stage of syphilis are inoculated with the virus
from lesions from these in the primary and secondary stage lesions of
the tertiary type are produced.

reference may be made to the #relapsing false indurated chancre#,
described by hutchinson and by fournier, as it may be the source of
difficulty in diagnosis. a patient who has had an infecting chancre one
or more years before, may present a slightly raised induration on the
penis at or close to the site of his original sore. this relapsed
induration is often so like that of a primary chancre that it is
impossible to distinguish between them, except by the history. if there
has been a recent exposure to venereal infection, it is liable to be
regarded as the primary lesion of a second attack of syphilis, but the
further progress shows that neither bullet-buboes nor secondary
manifestations develop. these facts, together with the disappearance of
the induration under treatment, make it very likely that the lesion is
really gummatous in character.


inherited syphilis

one of the most striking features of syphilis is that it may be
transmitted from infected parents to their offspring, the children
exhibiting the manifestations that characterise the acquired form of the
disease.

the more recent the syphilis in the parent, the greater is the risk of
the disease being communicated to the offspring; so that if either
parent suffers from secondary syphilis the infection is almost
inevitably transmitted.

while it is certain that either parent may be responsible for
transmitting the disease to the next generation, the method of
transmission is not known. in the case of a syphilitic mother it is most
probable that the infection is conveyed to the foetus by the placental
circulation. in the case of a syphilitic father, it is commonly believed
that the infection is conveyed to the ovum through the seminal fluid at
the moment of conception. if a series of children, one after the other,
suffer from inherited syphilis, it is almost invariably the case that
the mother has been infected.

in contrast to the acquired form, inherited syphilis is remarkable for
the absence of any primary stage, the infection being a general one from
the outset. the spirochaete is demonstrated in incredible numbers in the
liver, spleen, lung, and other organs, and in the nasal secretion, and,
from any of these, successful inoculations in monkeys can readily be
made. the manifestations differ in degree rather than in kind from those
of the acquired disease; the difference is partly due to the fact that
the virus is attacking developing instead of fully formed tissues.

the virus exercises an injurious influence on the foetus, which in many
cases dies during the early months of intra-uterine life, so that
miscarriage results, and this may take place in repeated pregnancies,
the date at which the miscarriage occurs becoming later as the virus in
the mother becomes attenuated. eventually a child is carried to full
term, and it may be still-born, or, if born alive, may suffer from
syphilitic manifestations. it is difficult to explain such vagaries of
syphilitic inheritance as the infection of one twin and the escape of
the other.

_clinical features._--we are not here concerned with the severe forms of
the disease which prove fatal, but with the milder forms in which the
infant is apparently healthy when born, but after from two to six weeks
begins to show evidence of the syphilitic taint.

the usual phenomena are that the child ceases to thrive, becomes thin
and sallow, and suffers from eruptions on the skin and mucous membranes.
there is frequently a condition known as _snuffles_, in which the nasal
passages are obstructed by an accumulation of thin muco-purulent
discharge which causes the breathing to be noisy. it usually begins
within a month after birth and before the eruptions on the skin appear.
when long continued it is liable to interfere with the development of
the nasal bones, so that when the child grows up there results a
condition known as the "saddle-nose" deformity (figs. 43 and 44).

[illustration: fig. 43.--facies of inherited syphilis.

(from dr. byrom bramwell's _atlas of clinical medicine_.)]

_affections of the skin._--although all types of skin affection are met
with in the inherited disease, the most important is a _papular_
eruption, the papules being of large size, with a smooth shining top and
of a reddish-brown colour. it affects chiefly the buttocks and thighs,
the genitals, and other parts which are constantly moist. it is
necessary to distinguish this specific eruption from a form of eczema
which occurs in these situations in non-syphilitic children, the points
that characterise the syphilitic condition being the infiltration of the
skin and the coppery colour of the eruption. at the anus the papules
acquire the characters of _condylomata_, also at the angles of the
mouth, where they often ulcerate and leave radiating scars.

_affections of the mucous membranes._--the inflammation of the nasal
mucous membrane that causes snuffles has already been referred to. there
may be mucous patches in the mouth, or a stomatitis which is of
importance, because it results in interference with the development of
the permanent teeth. the mucous membrane of the larynx may be the seat
of mucous patches or of catarrh, and as a result the child's cry is
hoarse.

_affections of the bones._--swellings at the ends of the long bones, due
to inflammation at the epiphysial junctions, are most often observed at
the upper end of the humerus and in the bones in the region of the
elbow. partial displacement and mobility at the ossifying junction may
be observed. the infant cries when the part is touched; and as it does
not move the limb voluntarily, the condition is spoken of as _the
pseudo-paralysis of syphilis_. recovery takes place under
anti-syphilitic treatment and immobilisation of the limb.

diffuse thickening of the shafts of the long bones, due to a deposit of
new bone by the periosteum, is sometimes met with.

[illustration: fig. 44.--facies of inherited syphilis.]

the conditions of the skull known as parrot's nodes or bosses, and
craniotabes, were formerly believed to be characteristic of inherited
syphilis, but they are now known to occur, particularly in rickety
children, from other causes. the _bosses_ result from the heaping up of
new spongy bone beneath the pericranium, and they may be grouped
symmetrically around the anterior fontanelle, or may extend along either
side of the sagittal suture, which appears as a deep groove--the
"natiform skull." the bosses disappear in time, but the skull may remain
permanently altered in shape, the frontal and parietal eminences
appearing unduly prominent. the term _craniotabes_ is applied when the
bone becomes thin and soft, reverting to its original membranous
condition, so that the affected areas dimple under the finger like
parchment or thin cardboard; its localisation in the posterior parts of
the skull suggests that the disappearance of the osseous tissue is
influenced by the pressure of the head on the pillow. craniotabes is
recovered from as the child improves in health.

between the ages of three and six months, certain other phenomena may be
met with, such as _effusion into the joints_, especially the knees;
_iritis_, in one or in both eyes, and enlargement of the spleen and
liver.

in the majority of cases the child recovers from these early
manifestations, especially when efficiently treated, and may enjoy an
indefinite period of good health. on the other hand, when it attains the
age of from two to four years, it may begin to manifest lesions which
correspond to those of the tertiary period of acquired syphilis.

#later lesions.#--in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, the later
manifestations may take the form of localised gummata, which tend to
break down and form ulcers, on the leg for example, or of a spreading
gummatous infiltration which is also liable to ulcerate, leaving
disfiguring scars, especially on the face. the palate and fauces may be
destroyed by ulceration. in the nose, especially when the ulcerative
process is associated with a putrid discharge--ozaena--the destruction of
tissue may be considerable and result in unsightly deformity. the entire
palatal portions of the upper jaws, the vomer, turbinate, and other
bones bounding the nasal and oral cavities, may disappear, so that on
looking into the mouth the base of the skull is readily seen. gummatous
disease is frequently observed also in the flat bones of the skull, in
the bones of the hand, as syphilitic dactylitis, and in the bones of the
forearm and leg. when the tibia is affected the disease is frequently
bilateral, and may assume the form of gummatous ulcers and sinuses. in
later years the tibia may present alterations in shape resulting from
antecedent gummatous disease--for example, nodular thickenings of the
shaft, flattening of the crest, or a more uniform increase in thickness
and length of the shaft of the bone, which, when it is curved in
addition, is described as the "sabre-blade" deformity. among lesions of
the viscera, mention should be made of gumma of the testis, which causes
the organ to become enlarged, uneven, and indurated. this has even been
observed in infants a few months old.

occasionally a syphilitic child suffers from a succession of these
gummatous lesions with resulting ill-health, and, it may be, waxy
disease of the internal organs; on the other hand, it may recover and
present no further manifestations of the inherited taint.

_affections of the eyes._--at or near puberty there is frequently
observed an affection of the eyes, known as _chronic interstitial
keratitis_, the relationship of which to inherited syphilis was first
established by hutchinson. it occurs between the ages of six and sixteen
years, and usually affects one eye before the other. it commences as a
diffuse haziness or steaminess near the centre of the cornea, and as it
spreads the entire cornea assumes the appearance of ground glass. the
chief complaint is of dimness of sight, which may almost amount to
blindness, but there is little pain or photophobia; a certain amount of
conjunctival and ciliary congestion is usually present, and there may be
_iritis_ in addition. the cornea, or parts of it, may become of a deep
pink or salmon colour from the formation in it of new blood vessels. the
affection may last for from eighteen months to two years. complete
recovery usually takes place, but slight opacities, especially in the
site of former salmon patches, may persist, and the disease occasionally
relapses. _choroiditis_ and _retinitis_ may also occur, and leave
permanent changes easily recognised on examination with the
ophthalmoscope.

among the rarer and more serious lesions of the inherited disease may be
mentioned gummatous disease in the _larynx and trachea_, attended with
ulceration and resulting in stenosis; and lesions of the _nervous
system_ which may result in convulsions, paralysis, or dementia.

in a limited number of cases, about the period of puberty there may
develop _deafness_, which is usually bilateral and may become absolute.

_changes in the permanent teeth._--these affect specially the upper
central incisors, which are dwarfed and stand somewhat apart in the gum,
with their free edges converging towards one another. they are tapering
or peg-shaped, and present at their cutting margin a deep semilunar
notch. these appearances are commonly associated with the name of
hutchinson, who first described them. affecting as they do the
permanent teeth, they are not available for diagnosis until the child is
over eight years of age. henry moon drew attention to a change in the
first molars; these are reduced in size and dome-shaped through dwarfing
of the central tubercle of each cusp.

#diagnosis of inherited syphilis.#--when there is a typical eruption on
the buttocks and snuffles there is no difficulty in recognising the
disease. when, however, the rash is scanty or is obscured by co-existing
eczema, most reliance should be placed on the distribution of the
eruption, on the brown stains which are left after it has passed off, on
the presence of condylomata, and of fissuring and scarring at the angles
of the mouth. the history of the mother relative to repeated
miscarriages and still-born children may afford confirmatory evidence.
in doubtful cases, the diagnosis may be aided by the wassermann test and
by noting the therapeutic effects of grey powder, which, in syphilitic
infants, usually effects a marked and rapid improvement both in the
symptoms and in the general health.

while a considerable number of syphilitic children grow up without
showing any trace of their syphilitic inheritance, the majority retain
throughout life one or more of the following characteristics, which may
therefore be described as _permanent signs of the inherited disease_:
dwarfing of stature from interference with growth at the epiphysial
junctions; the forehead low and vertical, and the parietal and frontal
eminences unduly prominent; the bridge of the nose sunken and rounded;
radiating scars at the angles of the mouth; perforation or destruction
of the hard palate; hutchinson's teeth; opacities of the cornea from
antecedent keratitis; alterations in the fundus oculi from choroiditis;
deafness; depressed scars or nodes on the bones from previous gummata;
"sabre-blade" or other deformity of the tibiae.

#the contagiousness of inherited syphilis.#--in 1837, colles of dublin
stated his belief that, while a syphilitic infant may convey the disease
to a healthy wet nurse, it is incapable of infecting its own mother if
nursed by her, even although she may never have shown symptoms of the
disease. this doctrine, which is known as _colles' law_, is generally
accepted in spite of the alleged occurrence of occasional exceptions.
the older the child, the less risk there is of its communicating the
disease to others, until eventually the tendency dies out altogether, as
it does in the tertiary period of acquired syphilis. it should be
added, however, that the contagiousness of inherited syphilis is denied
by some observers, who affirm that, when syphilitic infants prove
infective, the disease has been really acquired at or soon after birth.

there is general agreement that the subjects of inherited syphilis
cannot transmit the disease by inheritance to their offspring, and that,
although they very rarely acquire the disease _de novo_, it is possible
for them to do so.

#prognosis of inherited syphilis.#--although inherited syphilis is
responsible for a large but apparently diminishing mortality in infancy,
the subjects of this disease may grow up to be as strong and healthy as
their neighbours. hutchinson insisted on the fact that there is little
bad health in the general community that can be attributed to inherited
syphilis.

#treatment.#--arsenical injections are as beneficial in the inherited as
in the acquired disease. an infant the subject of inherited syphilis
should, if possible, be nursed by its mother, and failing this it should
be fed by hand. in infants at the breast, the drug may be given to the
mother; in others, it is administered in the same manner as already
described--only in smaller doses. on the first appearance of syphilitic
manifestations it should be given 0.05 grm, novarsenbillon, injected
into the deep subcutaneous tissues every week for six weeks, followed by
one year's mercurial inunction--a piece of mercurial ointment the size
of a pea being inserted under the infant's binder. in older children the
dose is proportionately increased. the general health should be improved
in every possible direction; considerable benefit may be derived from
the use of cod-liver oil, and from preparations containing iron and
calcium. surgical interference may be required in the destructive
gummatous lesions of the nose, throat, larynx, and bones, either with
the object of arresting the spread of the disease, or of removing or
alleviating the resulting deformities. in children suffering from
keratitis, the eyes should be protected from the light by smoked or
coloured glasses, and the pupils should be dilated with atropin from
time to time, especially in cases complicated with iritis.

#acquired syphilis in infants and young children.#--when syphilis is met
with in infants and young children, it is apt to be taken for granted
that the disease has been inherited. it is possible, however, for them
to acquire the disease--as, for example, while passing through the
maternal passages during birth, through being nursed or kissed by
infected women, or through the rite of circumcision. the risk of
infection which formerly existed by the arm-to-arm method of
vaccination has been abolished by the use of calf lymph.

the clinical features of the acquired disease in infants and young
children are similar to those observed in the adult, with a tendency,
however, to be more severe, probably because the disease is often late
in being recognised and treated.

[2] for the histology of tumours the reader is referred to a text-book
of pathology.

a tumour or neoplasm is a localised swelling composed of newly formed
tissue which fulfils no physiological function. tumours increase in size
quite independently of the growth of the body, and there is no natural
termination to their growth. they are to be distinguished from such
over-growths as are of the nature of simple hypertrophy or local
giantism, and also from inflammatory swellings, which usually develop
under the influence of a definite cause, have a natural termination, and
tend to disappear when the cause ceases to act.

the _etiology of tumours_ is imperfectly understood. various factors,
acting either singly or in combination, may be concerned in their
development. certain tumours, for example, are the result of some
congenital malformation of the particular tissue from which they take
origin. this would appear to be the case in many tumours of blood
vessels (angioma), of cartilage (chondroma), of bone (osteoma), and of
secreting gland tissue (adenoma). the theory that tumours originate from
foetal residues or "rests," is associated with the name of cohnheim.
these rests are supposed to be undifferentiated embryonic cells which
remain embedded amongst fully formed tissue elements, and lie dormant
until they are excited into active growth and give rise to a tumour.
this mode of origin is illustrated by the development of dermoids from
sequestrated portions of epidermis.

among the local factors concerned in the development of tumours,
reference must be made to the influence of irritation. this is probably
an important agent in the causation of many of the tumours met with in
the skin and in mucous membranes--for example, cancer of the skin, of
the lip, and of the tongue. the part played by injury is doubtful. it
not infrequently happens that the development of a tumour is preceded by
an injury of the part in which it grows, but it does not necessarily
follow that the injury and the tumour are related as cause and effect.
it is possible that an injury may stimulate into active growth
undifferentiated tissue elements or "rests," and so determine the growth
of a tumour, or that it may alter the characters of a tumour which
already exists, causing it to grow more rapidly.

the popular belief that there is some constitutional peculiarity
concerned in the causation of tumours is largely based on the fact that
certain forms of new growth--for example, cancer--are known to occur
with undue frequency in certain families. the same influence is more
striking in the case of certain innocent tumours--particularly multiple
osteomas and lipomas--which are hereditary in the same sense as
supernumerary or webbed fingers, and appear in members of the same
family through several generations.


innocent and malignant tumours

for clinical purposes, tumours are arbitrarily divided into two
classes--the innocent and the malignant. the outstanding difference
between them is, that while the evil effects of innocent tumours are
entirely local and depend for their severity on the environment of the
growth, malignant tumours wherever situated, in addition to producing
similar local effects, injure the general health and ultimately cause
death.

_innocent_, benign, or simple tumours present a close structural
resemblance to the normal tissues of the body. they grow slowly, and are
usually definitely circumscribed by a fibrous capsule, from which they
are easily enucleated, and they do not tend to recur after removal. in
their growth they merely push aside and compress adjacent parts, and
they present no tendency to ulcerate and bleed unless the overlying skin
or mucous membrane is injured. although usually solitary, some are
multiple from the outset--for example, fatty, fibrous, and bony tumours,
warts, and fibroid tumours of the uterus. they produce no constitutional
disturbance. they only threaten life when growing in the vicinity of
vital organs, and then only in virtue of their situation--for example,
death may result from an innocent tumour in the air-passage causing
suffocation, in the intestine causing obstruction of the bowels, or in
the vertebral canal causing pressure on the spinal medulla.

_malignant tumours_ usually show a marked departure from the structure
and arrangement of the normal tissues of the body. although the cells of
which they are composed are derived from normal tissue cells, they tend
to take on a lower, more vegetative form; they may be regarded as
parasites living at the expense of the organism, multiplying
indefinitely and destroying everything with which they come in contact.

malignant tumours grow more rapidly than innocent tumours, and tend to
infiltrate their surroundings by sending out prolongations or offshoots;
they are therefore liable to recur after an operation which is
restricted to the removal of the main tumour. they are not encapsulated,
although they may appear to be circumscribed by condensation of the
surrounding tissues; they are rarely multiple at the outset, but show a
marked tendency to spread to other parts of the body. fragments of the
parent tumour may become separated and be carried off in the lymph or
blood-stream and deposited in other parts of the body, where they give
rise to secondary growths. malignant tumours tend to invade and destroy
the overlying skin or mucous membrane, and thus give rise to bleeding
ulcers; if the tumour tissue protrudes through the gap in the skin, it
is said to _fungate_. in course of time they give rise to a condition of
ill-health or _cachexia_, the patient becoming pale, sallow, feverish,
and emaciated, probably as a result of chronic poisoning from the
absorption of toxic products from the tumour. they ultimately destroy
life, it may be by their local effects, such as ulceration and
haemorrhage, by favouring the entrance of septic infection, by
interfering with the function of organs which are essential to life, by
cachexia, or by a combination of these effects.

the situation of a malignant tumour exercises considerable influence on
the rapidity, as well as on the mode, in which it causes death. some
cancers, such as that known as "rodent," show malignant features which
are entirely local, while others, such as melanotic cancer, exhibit a
malignancy characterised by rapid generalisation of growths throughout
the body. tumours that are structurally alike may show variations in
malignancy, according to their situation and to the age of the patient,
as well as to other factors which are as yet unknown.

in attempting to arrive at a conclusion as to the innocence or
malignancy of any tumour, too much reliance must not be placed on its
histological features; its situation, rate of growth, and other clinical
features must also be taken into consideration. it cannot be too
emphatically stated that there is no hard-and-fast line between innocent
and malignant growths; there is an indefinite transition from one to the
other. the possibility of the transformation of a benign into a
malignant tumour must be admitted. such a transformation implies a
change in the structure of the growth, and has been observed especially
in fibrous and cartilaginous tumours, in tumours of the thyreoid gland,
and in uterine fibroids. the alteration in character may take place
under the influence of injury, prolonged or repeated irritation,
incomplete removal of the benign tumour by operation, or the altered
physiological conditions of the tissues which attend upon advancing
years.

after a tumour has been removed by operation it should as a routine
measure be subjected to microscopical examination; the results are often
instructive and sometimes other than what was expected.

#varieties of tumours.#--in the following description, tumours are
classified on an anatomical basis, taking in order first the
connective-tissue group and subsequently those that originate in
epithelium.


innocent connective-tissue tumours

#lipoma.#--a lipoma is composed of fat resembling that normally present
in the body. the commonest variety is the _subcutaneous lipoma_, which
grows from the subcutaneous fat, and forms a soft, irregularly lobulated
tumour (fig. 45). the fat is arranged in lobules separated by
connective-tissue septa, which are continuous with the capsule
surrounding the tumour and with the overlying skin, which becomes
dimpled or puckered when an attempt is made to pinch it up. as the fat
is almost fluid at the body temperature, fluctuation can usually be
detected. these tumours vary greatly in size, occur at all ages, grow
slowly, and, while generally solitary, are sometimes multiple. they are
most commonly met with on the shoulder, buttock, or back. in certain
situations, such as the thigh and perineum, they tend to become
pedunculated (fig. 46).

a fatty tumour is to be diagnosed from a cold abscess and from a cyst.
the distinguishing features of the lipoma are the tacking down and
dimpling of the overlying skin, the lobulation of the tumour, which is
recognised when it is pressed upon with the flat of the hand, and, more
reliable than either of these, the mobility, the tumour slipping away
when pressed upon at its margin.

[illustration: fig. 45.--subcutaneous lipoma showing lobulation.]

the prognosis is more favourable than in any other tumour as it never
changes its characters; the only reasons for its removal by operation
are its unsightliness and its probable increase in size in the course of
years. the operation consists in dividing the skin and capsule over the
tumour and shelling it out. care must be taken that none of the outlying
lobules are left behind. if the overlying skin is damaged or closely
adherent, it should be removed along with the tumour.

[illustration: fig. 46.--pedunculated lipoma of buttock of forty years'
duration in a woman aet. 68.]

_multiple subcutaneous lipomas_ are frequently symmetrical, and in a
certain group of cases, met with chiefly in women, pain is a prominent
symptom, hence the term _adiposis dolorosa_ (dercum). these multiple
tumours show little or no tendency to increase in size, and the pain
which attends their development does not persist.

in the neck, axilla, and pubes a diffuse overgrowth of the subcutaneous
fat is sometimes met with, forming symmetrical tumour-like masses, known
as _diffuse lipoma_. as this is not, strictly speaking, a tumour, the
term _diffuse lipomatosis_ is to be preferred. a similar condition was
described by jonathan hutchinson as being met with in the domestic
animals. if causing disfigurement, the mass of fat may be removed by
operation.

[illustration: fig. 47.--diffuse lipomatosis of neck.]

_lipoma in other situations._--the _periosteal lipoma_ is usually
congenital, and is most often met with in the hand; it forms a
projecting lobulated tumour, which, when situated in the palm, resembles
an angioma or a lymphangioma. the _subserous lipoma_ arises from the
extra-peritoneal fat in the posterior abdominal wall, in which case it
tends to grow forwards between the layers of the mesentery and to give
rise to an abdominal tumour; or it may grow from the extra-peritoneal
fat in the anterior abdominal wall and protrude from one of the hernial
openings or through an abnormal opening in the parietes, constituting a
_fatty hernia_. a _subsynovial lipoma_ grows from the fat surrounding
the synovial membrane of a joint, and projects into its interior, giving
rise to the symptoms of loose body. lipomas are also met with growing
from the adipose connective tissue _between or in the substance of
muscles_, and, when situated beneath the deep fascia, such as the fascia
lata of the thigh, the characteristic signs are obscured and a
differential diagnosis is difficult. it may be differentiated from a
cold abscess by puncture with an exploring needle.

[illustration: fig. 48.--zanthoma of hands in a girl aet. 14, showing
multiple subcutaneous tumours (cf. fig. 49).

(sir h. j. stiles' case.)]

#zanthoma# is a rare but interesting form of tumour, composed of a
fibrous and fatty tissue, containing a granular orange-yellow pigment,
resembling that of the corpus luteum. it originates in the corium and
presents two clinical varieties. in the first of these, it occurs in the
form of raised yellow patches, usually in the skin of the eyelids of
persons after middle life, and in many instances is associated with
chronic jaundice; the patches are often symmetrical, and as they
increase in size they tend to fuse with another.

the second form occurs in children and adolescents; it may affect
several generations of the same family, and is often multiple, there
being a combination of thickened yellow patches of skin and projecting
tumours, some of which may attain a considerable size (figs. 48 and 49).
on section, the tumour tissue presents a brilliant orange or saffron
colour.

there is no indication for removing the tumours unless for the deformity
which they cause; exposure to the x-rays is to be preferred to
operation.

[illustration: fig. 49.--zanthoma showing subcutaneous tumours on
buttocks. from same patient as fig. 48.]

#chondroma.#--a chondroma is mainly composed of cartilage. processes of
vascular connective tissue pass in between the nodules of cartilage
composing the tumour from the fibrous capsule which surrounds it. on
section it is of a greyish-blue colour and semi-translucent. the tumour
is firm and elastic in consistence, but certain portions may be densely
hard from calcification or ossification, while other portions may be
soft and fluctuating as a result of myxomatous degeneration and
liquefaction. these tumours grow slowly and painlessly, and may surround
nerves and arteries without injuring them. they may cause a deep hollow
in the bone from which they originate. all intermediate forms between
the innocent chondroma and the malignant chondro-sarcoma are met with.
chondroma may occur in a multiple form, especially in relation to the
phalanges and metacarpal bones. when growing in the interior of a bone
it causes a spindle-shaped enlargement of the shaft, which in the case
of a phalanx or metacarpal bone may resemble the dactylitis resulting
from tubercle or syphilis. a chondroma appears as a clear area in a
skiagram.

a _skiagram_ of a bone in which there is a chondroma shows a clear
rounded area in the position of the tumour, which must be differentiated
from similar clear areas due to other kinds of tumour, especially the
myeloma; when it has undergone calcification or ossification, it gives a
shadow as dark as bone.

[illustration: fig. 50.--chondroma growing from infraspinous fossa of
scapula.]

[illustration: fig. 51.--chondroma of metacarpal bone of thumb.]

_treatment._--in view of the unstable quality of the chondroma,
especially of its liability to become malignant, it should be removed as
soon as it is recognised. in those projecting from the surface of a
bone, both the tumour and its capsule should be removed. if in the
interior, a sufficient amount of the cortex should be removed to allow
of the tumour being scraped out, and care must be taken that no nodules
of cartilage are left behind. in multiple chondromas of the hand, when
the fingers are crippled and useless, exposure to the x-rays should be
given a trial, and in extreme cases the question of amputation may have
to be considered. when a cartilaginous tumour takes on active growth, it
must be treated as malignant.

the chondromas that are met with at the ends of the long bones in
children and young adults form a group by themselves. they are usually
related to the epiphysial cartilage, and it was suggested by virchow
that they take origin from islands of cartilage which have not been used
up in the process of ossification. they are believed to occur more
frequently in those who have suffered from rickets. they have no
malignant tendencies and tend to undergo ossification concurrently with
the epiphysial cartilage from which they take origin, and constitute
what are known as _cartilaginous exostoses_. these are sometimes met
with in a multiple form, and may occur in several generations of the
same family. they are considered in greater detail in the chapter
dealing with tumours of bone.

minute nodules of cartilage sometimes form in the synovial membrane of
joints and lining of tendon sheaths and bursae: they tend to become
detached from the membrane and constitute loose bodies; they also
undergo a variable amount of calcification and ossification, so as to be
visible in skiagrams. they are further considered with loose bodies in
joints.

cartilaginous tumours in the parotid, submaxillary gland, and testicle
belong to a class of "mixed tumours" that will be referred to later.

#osteoma.#--the true osteoma is composed of bony tissue, and originates
from the skeleton. two varieties are recognised--the spongy or
cancellous, and the ivory or compact. the _spongy_ or _cancellous
osteoma_ is really an ossified chondroma, and is met with at the ends of
the long bones (fig. 52). from the fact that it projects from the
surface of the bone it is often spoken of as an _exostosis_. it grows
slowly, and rarely causes any discomfort unless it presses upon a
nerve-trunk or upon a bursa which has developed over it. the rontgen
rays show a dark shadow corresponding to the ossified portion of the
tumour, and continuous with that of the bone from which it is growing
(fig. 138). operative interference is only indicated when the tumour is
giving rise to inconvenience. it is then removed, its base or neck being
divided by means of the chisel. the multiple variety of osteoma is
considered with the diseases of bone.

the bony outgrowth from the terminal phalanx of the great toe--known as
the _subungual exostosis_--is described and figured on p. 404. bony
projections or "spurs" sometimes occur on the under surface of the
calcaneus, and, projecting downwards and forwards from the greater
process, cause pain on putting the heel to the ground.

[illustration: fig. 52.--cancellous osteoma of lower end of femur.]

the _ivory_ or _compact osteoma_ is composed of dense bone, and usually
grows from the skull. it is generally sessile and solitary, and may grow
into the interior of the skull, into the frontal sinus, into the cavity
of the orbit or nose, or may fill up the external auditory meatus,
causing most unsightly deformity and interference with sight, breathing,
and hearing.

bony formations occur in _muscles and tendons_, especially at their
points of attachment to the skeleton, and are known as false exostoses;
they are described with the diseases of muscles.

#odontoma.#--an odontoma is composed of dental tissues in varying
proportions and different degrees of development, arising from
tooth-germs or from teeth still in process of growth (bland sutton).
odontomas resemble teeth in so far that during their development they
remain hidden below the mucous membrane and give no evidence of their
existence. there then succeeds, usually between the twentieth and
twenty-fifth years, an eruptive stage, which is often attended with
suppuration, and this may be the means of drawing attention to the
tumour. following bland sutton, several varieties of odontoma may be
distinguished according to the part of the tooth-germ concerned in their
formation.

the _epithelial odontoma_ is derived from persistent portions of the
epithelium of the enamel organ, and constitutes a multilocular cystic
tumour which is chiefly met with in the mandible. the cystic spaces of
the tumour contain a brownish glairy fluid. these tumours have been
described by eve under the name of multilocular cystic epithelial
tumours of the jaw.

the _follicular odontoma_, also known as a _dentigerous cyst_, is
derived from the distension of a tooth follicle. it constitutes a cyst
containing a viscid fluid, and an imperfectly formed tooth is often
found embedded in its wall. the cyst usually forms in relation to one of
the permanent molars, and may attain considerable dimensions.

the _fibrous odontoma_ is the result of an overgrowth of fibrous tissue
surrounding the tooth sac, which encapsulates the tooth and prevents its
eruption. the thickened tooth sac is usually mistaken for a fibrous
tumour, until, after removal, the tooth is recognised in its interior.

_composite odontoma._--this is a convenient term to apply to certain
hard dental tumours which are met with in the jaws, and consist of
enamel, dentine, and cement. the tumour is to be regarded as being
derived from an abnormal growth of all the elements of a tooth germ, or
of two or more tooth germs, indiscriminately fused with one another. it
may appear in childhood, and form a smooth unyielding tumour, often of
considerable size, replacing the corresponding permanent tooth. it may
cause a purulent discharge, and in some cases it has been extruded after
sloughing of the overlying soft parts. many examples of this variety of
odontoma, growing in the nasal cavity or in the maxillary sinus, have
been erroneously regarded as osteomas even after removal.

on section, the tumour is usually laminated, and is seen to consist
mainly of dentine with a partial covering of enamel and cement.

_diagnosis._--odontomas are often only diagnosed after removal. when
attended with suppuration, the condition has been mistaken for disease
of the jaw. fibrous odontomas have been mistaken for sarcoma, and
portions of the maxilla removed unnecessarily. any circumscribed tumour
of the jaw, particularly when met with in a young adult, should suggest
the possibility of an odontoma. skiagrams often give useful information
both for diagnosis and for treatment.

_treatment._--the solid varieties of odontoma can usually be shelled out
after dividing the overlying soft parts. in the follicular variety, it
is usually sufficient to excise a portion of the wall, scrape out the
interior, and remove any tooth that may be present. the cavity is then
packed and allowed to heal from the bottom.

#fibroma.#--a fibroma is a tumour composed of fibrous connective tissue.
a distinction may be made between the _soft fibroma_, which is
comparatively rich in cells and blood vessels, and in which the fibres
are arranged loosely; and the _hard fibroma_, which is composed of
closely packed bundles of fibres often arranged in a concentric fashion
around the blood vessels. the cut surface of the soft fibroma presents a
pinkish-white, fleshy appearance, resembling the slowly growing forms of
sarcoma; that of a hard fibroma presents a dry, glistening appearance,
aptly compared to watered silk. the soft variety grows much more rapidly
than the hard. in certain fibromas--in those, for example, which grow
from the periosteum of the base of the skull and project into the
naso-pharynx--the blood vessels are dilated into sinuses and have no
proper sheaths; they therefore tend to remain open when divided, and to
bleed excessively. transition forms between soft fibroma and sarcoma are
met with, so that in operating for their removal it is safer to take
away the capsule along with the tumour, and the patient should be kept
under observation in view of the risk of recurrence.

the skin--especially the skin of the buttock--is one of the favourite
seats of fibroma, and it may occur in a multiple form. it is met with
also in the subcutaneous and intermuscular cellular tissue, and in the
abdominal wall, where it sometimes attains considerable dimensions.
various forms of fibroma are met with in the mamma and are described
with diseases of that organ. the fibrous overgrowths in the skin, known
as _keloid_ and _molluscum fibrosum_, and those met with in the _sheaths
of nerves_, are described elsewhere. fibroid tumours of the uterus are
described with myoma.

_diffuse fibroma_ or _fibromatosis_, analogous to lipomatosis, is met
with in the connective tissue of the skin and sheaths of nerves, and
constitutes one form of neuro-fibromatosis; a similar change is also met
with in the stomach and colon.

#myxoma.#--a myxoma is composed of tissue of a soft gelatinous,
semifluid consistence. the pure myxoma is extremely rare, and
clinically resembles the lipoma. myxomatous tissue is, however,
frequently found in other connective-tissue tumours as a result of
degeneration, for example, in cartilaginous tumours and in sarcomas.
myxomatous tissue is also a prominent constituent of the "innocent
parotid tumour." mucous polypus of the nose, which is often described as
a myxoma, is merely a pendulous process of oedematous mucous membrane.

[illustration: fig. 53.--myeloma of shaft of humerus, causing
pathological fracture. (mr. j. w. struthers' case.)

(the unusual site of the tumour is to be noted.)]

#myeloma.#--a myeloma is composed of large multinuclear giant cells
surrounded by round and spindle cells. the cut surface of the tumour
presents a deep red or maroon colour. while occasionally met with in
tendon sheaths and bursae, and is then of an orange-yellow colour, the
myeloma occurs most frequently in the cancellous tissue at the ends of
the long bones, its favourite site being the upper end of the tibia.
although formerly classified as a sarcoma, it is the exception for it to
present malignant features, and it can usually be extirpated by local
measures without fear of recurrence. the diagnosis, x-ray appearances,
and the method of removal are considered with the diseases of bone.
sometimes the myeloma is met with in multiple form in the skeleton, in
association with an unusual form of protein in the urine (bence jones).

#myoma.#--a myoma is composed of non-striped muscle fibres. a pure myoma
is very rare, and is met with in organs possessed of non-striped muscle,
such as the stomach, intestine, urinary bladder, and prostate. in the
uterus, which is the most common situation, these tumours contain a
considerable admixture of fibrous tissue, and are known as _fibroids_ or
_fibro-myomas_. they present on section a fasciculated appearance, which
may resemble that of a section of balls of cotton (fig. 54). they are
encapsulated and vascular, frequently attain a large size, and may be
single or multiple. while they may occasion neither inconvenience nor
suffering, they frequently give rise to profuse haemorrhage from the
uterus, and may cause serious symptoms by pressing injuriously on the
ureters or the intestine, or by complicating pregnancy and parturition.

the #rhabdomyoma# is an extremely rare form of tumour, met with in the
kidney, uterus, and testicle. it contains striped muscle fibres, and is
supposed to originate from a residue of muscular tissue which has become
sequestrated during development.

[illustration: fig. 54.--fibro-myoma of uterus.

#glioma.#--a glioma is a tumour composed of neuroglia. it is met with
exclusively in the central nervous system, retina, and optic nerve. it
is a slowly growing, soft, ill-defined tumour, which displaces the
adjacent nerve centres and nerve tracts, and is liable to become the
seat of haemorrhage and thus to give rise to pressure symptoms resembling
apoplexy. the glioma of the retina tends to grow into the vitreous
humour and to perforate the globe. it is usually of the nature of a
glio-sarcoma and is highly malignant.

#endotheliomas# take origin from the endothelium of lymph vessels and
blood vessels, and serous cavities. they show great variation in type,
partly because of the number of different kinds of endothelium from
which they are derived, and partly because the new connective tissue
which is formed is liable to undergo transformation into other tissues.
they may be soft or hard, solid or cystic, diffuse or circumscribed;
they grow very slowly, and are almost always innocent, although
recurrence has been occasionally observed. cases of multiple
endotheliomata of the skin have recently been described by wise.

_angioma_, _lymphangioma_, and _neuroma_ are described with the disease
of the individual tissues.


malignant connective-tissue tumours--sarcoma

the term sarcoma is applied to any connective-tissue tumour which
exhibits malignant characters. the essential structural feature is the
predominance of the cellular elements over the intercellular substance
or stroma, in which respect a sarcoma resembles the connective tissue of
the embryo. the typical sarcoma consists chiefly of immature or
embryonic connective tissue. it most frequently originates from fascia,
intermuscular connective tissue, periosteum, bone-marrow, and skin, and
forms a rounded or nodulated tumour which appears to be encapsulated,
but the capsule merely consists of the condensed surrounding tissues,
and usually contains sarcomatous elements. the consistence of the tumour
depends on the nature and amount of the stroma, and on the presence of
degenerative changes. the softer medullary forms are composed almost
exclusively of cells; while the harder forms--such as the fibro-,
chondro-, and osteo-sarcoma--are provided with an abundant stroma and
are relatively poor in cells. degenerative changes may produce areas of
softening or liquefaction which result in the formation of cystic
cavities in the interior of the tumour. the colour depends on the amount
of blood in the tumour, and on the presence of the products of
degeneration.

the blood vessels are usually represented by mere chinks or spaces
between the cells. this peculiarity accounts for the facility with which
haemorrhage takes place into the substance of the tumour, the persistence
of the bleeding when it is incised or ulcerates through the skin, and
the readiness with which the sarcomatous cells are carried off and
infect distant parts through the blood-stream. sarcomas are devoid of
lymphatics, and unless originating in lymphatic structures--for example,
in the tonsil--they rarely infect the lymph glands. minute portions of
the tumour grow into the small veins, and, becoming detached, are
transported by the blood-current to distant organs, where they are
arrested in the capillaries and give rise to secondary growths. these
are most frequently situated in the lungs, except when the primary
growth lies within the territory of the portal circulation, in which
case they occur in the liver. the secondary growths closely resemble the
parent tumour. sarcoma may invade an adjacent vein on such a scale that
if the invading portion becomes detached it may constitute a dangerous
embolus. this may be observed in sarcoma of the kidney, the growth
taking place along the renal vein until it projects into the vena cava.

[illustration: fig. 55.--recurrent sarcoma of sciatic nerve in a woman
aet. 27. recurrence twenty months after removal of primary growth.]

in its growth, a sarcoma compresses and destroys neighbouring parts,
surrounds vessels and nerves, and may lead to destruction of the skin,
either by invading it, or more commonly by causing sloughing from
pressure. inflammatory and suppurative changes may take place as a
result of pyogenic infection following upon sloughing of the overlying
skin or upon an exploratory incision. once the skin is broken the tumour
fungates through the opening. sarcomas vary in malignancy, especially as
regards rapidity of growth and capacity for dissemination. certain of
them, such as the so-called "recurrent fibroid of paget," grow
comparatively slowly, and are only malignant in the sense that they tend
to recur locally after removal; others--especially the more cellular
ones--grow with extreme rapidity, and are early disseminated throughout
the body, resembling in these respects the most malignant forms of
cancer. they are usually solitary in the first instance, although
primary multiple growths are occasionally met with in the skin and in
the bones.

many varieties of sarcoma are recognised, according to its structural
peculiarities. thus, in virtue of the size and character of the cells,
we have the _small round-celled_ and the _large round-celled_ sarcoma,
the _small_ and the _large spindle-celled_, the _giant-celled_ and the
_mixed-celled_ sarcoma. the _lympho-sarcoma_ presents a structure
similar to that of lymph-follicular tissue, and the _alveolar sarcoma_
an arrangement of cells in alveoli resembling that seen in cancers. when
there is a considerable amount of intercellular fibrous tissue, the
tumour is called a _fibro-sarcoma_.

[illustration: fig. 56.--fungating sarcoma of arm.

(dr. j. m'watt's case.)]

the term _lymphangio-sarcoma_ is applied when the cells of the tumour
are derived from the endothelium of lymph spaces and vessels. the
_angio-sarcomas_ are those in which blood vessels form a prominent
element in the structure of the tumour. they are sometimes derived from
innocent angiomas, and they may be so vascular as to pulsate and on
auscultation yield a blowing murmur like an aneurysm. the
_glio-sarcoma_, _myxo-sarcoma_, _chondro-sarcoma_, and _myo-sarcoma_ are
mixed forms which usually develop in pre-existing innocent tumours. the
_osteo-sarcoma_ is characterised by the formation in the tumour of bone,
the medullary spaces being occupied by sarcomatous cells in place of
marrow. the _osteoid sarcoma_ is characterised by the formation of a
tissue resembling bone but deficient in lime salts, and the _petrifying
sarcoma_ by the formation of calcified areas in the stroma. these
varieties, although met with chiefly in the bones, may occur in soft
tissues such as muscle, and in such organs as the mamma. the pigmented
varieties include the _chloroma_, which is of a light-green colour, and
the _melanotic sarcoma_, which is brown or black. the _psammoma_ is a
sarcoma containing a material resembling sand; it is chiefly met with in
the membranes of the brain. the _chordoma_ is a rare form of tumour
originating from the remains of the notochord in the region of the
spheno-occipital synchondrosis or in the sacro-coccygeal region.

_diagnosis of sarcoma._--a sarcoma is to be differentiated from an
inflammatory swelling such as results from tubercle, actinomycosis, or
syphilis, from an innocent tumour, and from a cancer. the points on
which the diagnosis is founded are discussed with the different tissues
and organs.

_treatment._--the removal of the tumour by operation is the most
reliable method of treatment; in order to be successful it must be
undertaken before dissemination has taken place, and a considerable area
of healthy tissue beyond the apparent margin of the growth must be
removed, and in tumours near the surface of the body, the overlying skin
also.

in order to prevent recurrence, a tube of _radium_, to which a silk
thread is attached, is inserted into the space from which the tumour was
removed; the thread is brought out at the drain-opening, and at the end
of a week or ten days the tube of radium is removed by pulling on the
thread. radium causes a reaction in the tissues attended with exudation
from the vessels, for the escape of which provision must be made. if
radium is not available, the affected area is repeatedly exposed to the
action of the _x-rays_ as soon as the wound has healed. the employment
of these measures has diminished to a remarkable degree the recurrence
of sarcoma after operation.

it will readily be understood that the less thoroughly or radically the
growth has been removed, the more do we depend upon radium or the x-rays
for bringing about a permanent cure, and that in advanced cases of
sarcoma and in cases in which, on account of their anatomical situation,
removal by operation is necessarily incomplete, the prospect of cure is
still more dependent on the use of radium or of the x-rays. finally,
there are cases in which removal by operation is impossible, the
so-called _inoperable sarcoma_; a tube of radium, to which a silk thread
is attached, is inserted into the substance of the tumour, either
through an opening made by a large trocar, or, when necessary, by open
dissection. a second tube of radium is placed upon the skin over the
tumour and is secured there by a stitch or by a strip of plaster, thus
securing a cross-fire action of the radium rays, both from within and
without, as this is found to be much more efficacious in destroying or
inhibiting the cellular elements of the growth. the tubes of radium are
left _in situ_ for from eight to fourteen days, according to the power
of the radium employed, but are moved about every second day or so in
order that every part of the tumour may be efficiently radiated. if the
tumour shrinks in size after the use of radium and becomes operable, it
should be removed before time is given it to resume its growth. it will
depend upon the subsequent course of the disease, whether or not a
second, or it may be even a third, application of radium will be
required.

where neither radium nor x-rays is available or applicable, recourse may
be had to the injection of coley's fluid, a preparation containing the
mixed toxins of the streptococcus of erysipelas and the bacillus
prodigiosus; or of selenium.


epithelial tumours

an excessive and erratic growth of epithelium is the essential and
distinguishing feature of these tumours. the innocent forms are the
papilloma and the adenoma; the malignant, the carcinoma or cancer.

#papilloma.#--a papilloma is a tumour which projects from a cutaneous or
mucous surface, and consists of a central axis of vascular fibrous
tissue with a covering of epithelium resembling that of the surface from
which the tumour grows. in the papillomas of the skin--commonly known as
_warts_--the covering consists of epidermis; in those growing from
mucous surfaces it consists of the epithelium covering the mucous
membrane. when the surface epithelium projects as filiform processes,
the tumour is called a _villous papilloma_, the best-known example of
which is met with in the urinary bladder. papillomatous growths are
also met with in the larynx, in the ducts of the breast, and in the
interior of certain cystic tumours of the breast and of the ovary.
although papillomas are primarily innocent, they may become the
starting-point of cancer, especially in persons past middle life and if
the papilloma has been subjected to irritation and has ulcerated. the
clinical features and treatment of the various forms of papilloma are
considered with the individual tissues and organs.

#adenoma.#--an adenoma is a tumour constructed on the type of, and
growing in connection with, a secreting gland. in the substance of such
glands as the mamma, parotid, thyreoid, and prostate, adenomas are met
with as encapsulated tumours. when they originate from the glands of the
skin or of a mucous membrane, they tend to project from the surface, and
form pedunculated tumours or polypi.

adenomas may be single or multiple, and they vary greatly in size. the
tumour is seldom composed entirely of gland tissue; it usually contains
a considerable proportion of fibrous tissue, and is then called a
_fibro-adenoma_. when it contains myxomatous tissue it is called a
_myxo-adenoma_, and when the gland spaces of the tumour become distended
with accumulated secretion, a _cystic adenoma_, the best examples of
which are met with in the mamma and ovary. a characteristic feature of
the cystic variety is the tendency the tumour tissue exhibits to project
into the interior of the cysts, constituting what are known as
_intracystic growths_. they are essentially innocent, but intracystic
growths, especially in the mamma of women over fifty, should be regarded
with suspicion and therefore should be removed on radical lines.
transition forms between adenoma and carcinoma are also met with in the
rectum and large intestine, and these should be treated on the same
lines as cancer.


carcinoma or cancer

a cancer is a malignant tumour which originates in epithelium. the
cancer cells are derived by proliferation from already existing
epithelium, and they invade the sub-epithelial connective tissue in the
form of simple or branching columns. these columns are enclosed in
spaces--termed alveoli--which are probably dilated lymph spaces, and
which communicate freely with the lymph vessels. the cells composing the
columns and filling the alveoli vary with the character of the
epithelium in which the cancer originates. the malignancy of cancer
depends on the tendency which the epithelium has of invading the tissues
in its neighbourhood, and on the capacity of the cells, when
transported elsewhere by the lymph or blood-stream, of giving rise to
secondary growths.

cancer may arise on any surface covered by epithelium or in any of the
secreting glands of the body, but it is much more common in some
situations than in others. it is frequently met with, for example, in
the skin, in the stomach and large intestine, in the breast, the uterus,
and the external genitals; less frequently in the gall-bladder, larynx,
thyreoid, prostate, and urinary bladder.

tissues appear to be most liable to cancer when, having attained
maturity, they enter upon the phase of decadence or involution, and this
phase is reached by different tissues at different periods. it is not so
much, therefore, the age of the person in whom it occurs, as the age of
the tissue in which it arises, that determines the maximum incidence of
cancer. cancer of the stomach appears and attains a maximum frequency
earlier than cancer of the skin; cancer of the uterus and mamma is more
frequent towards the decline of reproductive activity than in the later
years of life; rectal cancer is not infrequently met with during the
second and third decades. there is evidence that the irritation caused
by alcohol and tobacco plays a part in the causation of cancer, in the
fact that a large proportion of those who become the subjects of cancer
of the mouth are excessive drinkers and smokers.

a cancer may appear as a papillary growth on a mucous or a skin surface,
as a nodule in the substance of an organ, or as a diffuse thickening of
a tubular organ such as the stomach or intestine. the absence of
definition in cancerous tumours explains the difficulty of completely
removing them by surgical measures, and has led to the practice of
complete extirpation of cancerous organs wherever this is possible. the
boundaries of the affected organ, moreover, are frequently transgressed
by the disease, and the epithelial infiltration implicates the
surrounding parts. in cancer of the breast, for example, the disease
often extends to the adjacent skin, fat, and muscle; in cancer of the
lip or tongue, to the mandible; in cancer of the uterus or intestine, to
the investing peritoneum.

in addition to its tendency to infiltrate adjacent tissues and organs,
cancer is also liable to give rise to _secondary growths_. these are
most often met with in the nearest lymph glands; those in the neck, for
example, becoming infected from cancer of the lip, tongue, or throat;
those in the axilla, from cancer of the breast; those along the
curvatures of the stomach, from cancer of the pylorus; and those in the
groin, from cancer of the external genitals. in lymph vessels the cancer
cells may merely accumulate so as to fill the lumen and form indurated
cords, or they may proliferate and give rise to secondary nodules along
the course of the vessels. when the lymphatic network in the skin is
diffusely infected, the appearance is either that of a multitude of
secondary nodules or of a diffuse thickening, so that the skin comes to
resemble coarse leather. on the wall of the chest this condition is
known as _cancer en cuirasse_. although the cancer cells constantly
attack the walls of the adjacent veins and spread into their interior at
a comparatively early period, secondary growths due to dissemination by
the blood-stream rarely show themselves clinically until late in the
course of the disease. it is probable that many of the cancer cells
which are carried away in the blood or lymph stream undergo necrosis and
fail to give rise to secondary growths. secondary growths present a
faithful reproduction of the structure of the primary tumour. apart from
the lymph glands, the chief seats of secondary growths are the liver,
lungs, serous membranes, and bone marrow.

it is generally believed that the secondary growths in cancer that
develop at a distance from the primary tumour, those, for example, in
the medullary canal of the femur or in the diploe of the skull occurring
in advanced cases of cancer of the breast, are the result of
dissemination of cancer cells by way of the blood-stream and are to be
regarded as emboli. sampson handley disagrees with this view; he
believes that the dissemination is accomplished in a more subtle way,
namely, by the actual growth of cancer cells along the finer vessels of
the lymph plexuses that ramify in the deep fascia, a method of spread
which he calls _permeation_. it is maintained also that permeation
occurs as readily against the lymph stream as with it. he compares the
spread of cancer to that of an invisible annular ringworm. the growing
edge extends in a wider and wider circle, within which a healing process
may occur, so that the area of permeation is a ring, rather than a disc.
healing occurs by a process of "peri-lymphatic fibrosis," but as the
natural process of healing may fail at isolated points, nodules of
cancer appear, which, although apparently separate from the primary
growth, have developed in continuity with it, peri-lymphatic fibrosis
having destroyed the cancer chain connecting the nodule with the primary
growth. this centrifugal spread of cancer is clearly seen in the
distribution of the subcutaneous secondary nodules so frequently met
with in the late stages of mammary cancer. the area within which the
secondary nodules occur is a circle of continually increasing diameter
with the primary growth in the centre.

in the rare cases in which the skin of the greater part of the body is
affected, the nodules rarely appear below the level of the deltoid or
the middle third of the thigh, the patient dying before the spread can
reach the distal portions of the limbs.

handley argues against the embolic origin of the metastases in the bones
because of the rarity of these in the bones of the distal parts of the
limbs, because of the fact that secondary cancer of the femur nearly
always commences in the upper third of the shaft, which harmonises with
the intimate connection of the deep fascia with the periosteum over the
great trochanter, thus favouring invasion of the bone marrow when
permeation has spread thus far. he claims support for the permeation
theory from the fact that the humerus is rarely involved below the
insertion of the deltoid, and that spontaneous fracture of the femur is
three times more common on the side on which the breast cancer is
situated.

the tumour tissue may undergo necrosis, and when the overlying skin or
mucous membrane gives way an ulcer is formed. the margins of a
_cancerous ulcer_ (fig. 57) are made up of tumour tissue which has not
broken down. usually they are irregular, nodularly thickened or
indurated; sometimes they are raised and crater-like. the floor of the
ulcer is smooth and glazed, or occupied by necrosed tissue, and the
discharge is watery and blood-stained, and as a result of putrefactive
changes may become offensive. haemorrhage is rarely a prominent feature,
but discharge of blood may constitute a symptom of considerable
diagnostic importance in cancer of internal organs such as the rectum,
the bladder, or the uterus.

[illustration: fig. 57.--carcinoma of breast with cancerous ulcer.]

_the contagiousness of cancer._--a limited number of cases are on record
in which a cancer appears to have been transferred by contact, as from
the lower to the upper lip, from one labium majus to the other, from the
tongue to the cheek, and from one vocal cord to the other; these being
all examples of cancer involving surfaces which are constantly or
frequently in contact. the transference of cancer from one human being
to another, whether by accident, as in the case of a surgeon wounding
his finger while operating for cancer, or by the deliberate introduction
of a portion of cancerous tumour into the tissues, has never been known
to occur. it is by no means infrequent, however, that when recurrence
takes place after an operation for the removal of cancer, the recurrent
nodules make their appearance in the main scar or in the scars of
stitches in its neighbourhood. in the lower animals the grafting of
cancer only succeeds in animals of the same species; for example, a
cancer taken from a mouse will not grow in the tissues of a rat, but
only in a mouse of the same variety as that from which the graft was
taken.

while cancer cannot be regarded as either contagious or infectious, it
is important to bear in mind the possibility of infection of a wound
with cancer when operating for the disease. a cancer should not be cut
into unless this is essential for purposes of diagnosis, and the wound
made for exploration should be tightly closed by stitches before the
curative operation is proceeded with; the instruments used for the
exploration must not be used again until they have been boiled. the
greatest care should be taken that a cancer which has softened or broken
down is not opened into during the operation.

investigations regarding the cause of cancer have been prosecuted with
great energy during recent years, but as yet without positive result. it
is recognised that there are a number of conditions which favour the
development of cancer, such as prolonged irritation, and a considerable
number of cases have been recorded in which cancer of the skin of the
hands has followed prolonged and repeated exposure to the rontgen rays.

_the alleged increase of cancer._--regarding the alleged increase of
cancer, it may be pointed out that it is impossible to ascertain how
much of the apparent increase is due to more accurate diagnosis and
improved registration. it is probable also that some increase has taken
place in consequence of the increased average duration of life; a larger
proportion of persons now reach the age at which cancer is frequent.

_the prognosis_ largely depends on the variety of cancer and on its
situation. certain varieties--such as the atrophic cancer of the breast
which occurs in old people, and some forms of cancer in the rectum--are
so indolent in their progress that they can scarcely be said to shorten
life; while others--such as the softer varieties of mammary cancer
occurring in young women--are among the most malignant of tumours. the
mode in which cancer causes death depends to a large extent upon its
situation. in the gullet, for example, it usually causes death by
starvation; in the larynx or thyreoid, by suffocation; in the intestine,
by obstruction of the bowels; in the uterus, prostate, and bladder, by
haemorrhage or by implication of the ureters and kidneys. independently
of their situation, however, cancers frequently cause death by giving
rise to a progressive impairment of health known as the _cancerous
cachexia_, a condition which is due to the continued absorption of
poisonous products from the tumour. the patient loses appetite, becomes
emaciated, pale, and feverish, and gradually loses strength until he
dies. in many cases, especially those in which ulceration has occurred,
the addition of pyogenic infection may also be concerned in the failure
of health.

_treatment._--removal by surgical means affords the best prospect of
cure. if carcinomatous disease is to be rooted out, its mode of spread
by means of the lymph vessels must be borne in mind, and as this occurs
at an early stage, and is not evident on examination, a wide area must
be included in the operation. the organ from which the original growth
springs should, if practicable, be altogether removed, because its lymph
vessels generally communicate freely with each other, and secondary
deposits have probably already taken place in various parts of it. in
addition, the nearest chain of lymph glands must also be removed, even
though they may not be noticeably enlarged, and in some cases--in cancer
of the breast, for example--the intervening lymph vessels should be
removed at the same time.

the treatment of cancer by other than operative methods has received a
great deal of attention within recent years, and many agents have been
put to the test, _e.g._ colloidal suspensions of selenium, but without
any positive results. most benefit has resulted from the use of radium
and of the x-rays, and one or other should be employed as a routine
measure after every operation for cancer.

it has been demonstrated that cancer cells are more sensitive to radium
and to the rontgen rays than the normal cells of the body, and are more
easily killed. the effect varies a good deal with the nature and seat of
the tumour. in rodent cancers of the skin, for example, both radium and
x-ray treatment are very successful, and are to be preferred to
operation because they yield a better cosmetic result. while small
epitheliomas of the skin may be cured by means of the rays, they are not
so amenable as rodent cancers.

cancers of mucous membranes are less amenable to ray treatment because
they are less circumscribed and are difficult of access. in cancers
under the skin, the rontgen rays are less efficient; if radium is
employed, the tube containing it should be inserted into the substance
of the tumour after the method described in connection with sarcoma--and
another tube should be placed on the overlying skin.

in the employment of x-rays and of radium in the treatment of cancer,
experience is required, not only to obtain the maximum effect of the
rays, but to avoid damage to the adjacent and overlying tissues.

ray treatment is not to be looked upon as a rival but as a powerful
supplement to the operative treatment of cancer.


varieties of cancer

the varieties of cancer are distinguished according to the character and
arrangement of the epithelial cells.

the _squamous epithelial cancer_ or _epithelioma_ originates from a
surface covered by squamous epithelium, such as the skin, or the mucous
membrane of the mouth, gullet, or larynx. the cancer cells retain the
characters of squamous epithelium, and, being confined within the lymph
spaces of the sub-epithelial connective tissue, become compressed and
undergo a horny change. this results in the formation of concentrically
laminated masses known as cell nests.

the clinical features are those of a slowly growing indurated tumour,
which nearly always ulcerates; there is a characteristic induration of
the edges and floor of the ulcer, and its surface is often covered with
warty or cauliflower-like outgrowths (fig. 58). the infection of the
lymph glands is early and constant, and constitutes the most dangerous
feature of the disease; the secondary growths in the glands exhibit the
characteristic induration, and may themselves break down and lead to the
formation of ulcers.

[illustration: fig. 58.--epithelioma of lip.]

epithelioma frequently originates in long-standing ulcers or sinuses,
and in scars, and probably results from the displacement and
sequestration of epithelial cells during the process of cicatrisation.

the _columnar epithelial cancer_ or _columnar epithelioma_ originates in
mucous membranes covered with columnar epithelium, and is chiefly met
with in the stomach and intestine. as it resembles an adenoma in
structure it is sometimes described as a _malignant adenoma_. its
malignancy is shown by the proliferating epithelium invading the other
coats of the stomach or intestine, and by the development of secondary
growths.

_glandular carcinoma_ originates in organs such as the breast, and in
the glands of mucous membranes and skin. the epithelial cells are not
arranged on any definite plan, but are closely packed in irregularly
shaped alveoli. if the alveoli are large and the intervening stroma is
scanty and delicate, the tumour is soft and brain-like, and is described
as a _medullary_ or _encephaloid cancer_. if the alveoli are small and
the intervening stroma is abundant and composed of dense fibrous tissue,
the tumour is hard, and is known as a _scirrhous cancer_--a form which
is most frequently met with in the breast. if the cells undergo
degeneration and absorption and the stroma contracts, the tumour becomes
still harder, and tends to shrink and to draw in the surrounding parts,
leading, in the breast, to retraction of the nipple and overlying skin,
and in the stomach and colon to narrowing of the lumen. when the cells
of the tumour undergo colloid degeneration, a _colloid cancer_ results;
if the degeneration is complete, as may occur in the breast, the
malignancy is thereby greatly diminished; if only partial, as is more
common in rectal cancer, the malignancy is not appreciably affected.
melanin pigment is formed in relation to the cells and stroma of certain
epithelial tumours, giving rise to _melanotic cancer_, one of the most
malignant of all new growths. cyst-like spaces may form in the tumour by
the accumulation of the secretion of the epithelial cells, or as a
result of their degeneration--_cystic carcinoma_. this is met with
chiefly in the breast and ovary, and the tumour resembles the cystic
adenoma, but it tends to infect its surroundings and gives rise to
secondary growths.

_rodent cancer_ originates in the glands of the skin, and presents a
special tendency to break down and ulcerate on the surface (figs. 102
and 103). it almost never infects the lymph glands.


dermoids

a dermoid is a tumour containing skin or mucous membrane, occurring in a
situation where these tissues are not met under normal conditions.

the _skin dermoid_, or _derma-cyst_ as it has been called by askanazy,
arises from a portion of epiblast, which has become sequestrated during
the process of coalescence of two cutaneous surfaces in development.
this form is therefore most frequently met with on the face and neck in
the situations which correspond to the various clefts and fissures of
the embryo. it occurs also on the trunk in situations where the lateral
halves of the body coalesce during development. such a dermoid usually
takes the form of a globular cyst, the wall of which consists of skin,
and the contents of turbid fluid containing desquamated epithelium, fat
droplets, cholestrol crystals, and detached hairs. delicate hairs may
also be found projecting from the epithelial lining of the cyst.

faulty coalescence of the cutaneous covering of the back occurs most
frequently over the lower sacral vertebrae, giving rise to small
congenital recesses, known as post-anal dimples and coccygeal sinuses.
these recesses are lined with skin, which is furnished with hairs,
sebaceous and sweat glands. if the external orifice becomes occluded,
there results a dermoid cyst.

_tubulo-dermoids_ arise from embryonic ducts and passages that are
normally obliterated at birth, for example, _lingual dermoids_ develop
in relation to the thyreo-glossal duct; _rectal and post-rectal_
dermoids to the post-anal gut; and _branchial dermoids_ in relation to
the branchial clefts. tubulo-dermoids present the same structure as skin
dermoids, save that mucous membrane takes the place of skin in the wall
of the cyst, and the contents consist of the pent-up secretion of mucous
glands.

_clinical features._--although dermoids are of congenital origin, they
are rarely evident at birth, and may not give rise to visible tumours
until puberty, when the skin and its appendages become more active, or
not till adult life. superficial dermoids, such as those met with at the
outer angle of the orbit, form rounded, definitely limited tumours over
which the skin is freely movable. they are usually adherent to the
deeper parts, and when situated over the skull may be lodged in a
depression or actual gap in the bone. sometimes the cyst becomes
infected and suppurates, and finally ruptures on the surface. this may
lead to a natural cure, or a persistent sinus may form. dermoids more
deeply placed, such as those within the thorax, or those situated
between the rectum and sacrum, give rise to difficulty in diagnosis,
even with the help of the x-rays, and their nature is seldom recognised
until the escape of the contents--particularly hairs--supplies the clue.
the literature of dermoid cysts is full of accounts of puzzling tumours
met with in all sorts of situations.

the treatment is to remove the cyst. when it is impossible to remove the
whole of the lining membrane by dissection, the portion that is left
should be destroyed with the cautery.

_ovarian dermoids._--dermoids are not uncommon in the ovary (fig. 59).
they usually take the form of unilocular or multilocular cysts, the
wall of which contains skin, mucous membrane, hair follicles, sebaceous,
sweat, and mucous glands, nails, teeth, nipples, and mammary glands. the
cavity of the cyst usually contains a pultaceous mixture of shed
epithelium, fluid fat, and hair. if the cyst ruptures, the epithelial
elements are diffused over the peritoneum, and may give rise to
secondary dermoids.

[illustration: fig. 59.--dermoid cyst of ovary showing teeth in its
interior.]

the ovarian dermoid appears clinically as an abdominal or pelvic tumour
provided with a pedicle; if the pedicle becomes twisted, the tumour
undergoes strangulation, an event which is attended with urgent
symptoms, not unlike those of strangulated hernia.

the treatment consists in removing the tumour by laparotomy.

#teratoma.#--a teratoma is believed to result from partial dichotomy or
cleavage of the trunk axis of the embryo, and is found exclusively in
connection with the skull and vertebral column. it may take the form of
a monstrosity such as conjoined twins or a parasitic foetus, but more
commonly it is met with as an irregularly shaped tumour, usually growing
from the sacrum. on dissection, such a tumour is found to contain a
curious mixture of tissues--bones, skin, and portions of viscera, such
as the intestine or liver. the question of the removal of the tumour
requires to be considered in relation to the conditions present in each
individual case.


cysts[3]

[3] cysts which form in relation to new-growths have been considered
with tumours.

cysts are rounded sacs, the wall being composed of fibrous tissue lined
by epithelium or endothelium; the contents are fluid or semi-solid, and
vary in character according to the tissue in which the cyst has
originated.

_retention and exudation cysts._--_retention cysts_ develop when the
duct of a secreting gland is partly obstructed; the secretion
accumulates, and the gland and its duct become distended into a cyst.
they are met with in the mamma and in the salivary glands. sebaceous
cysts or wens are described with diseases of the skin. _exudation cysts_
arise from the distension of cavities which are not provided with
excretory ducts, such as those in the thyreoid.

_implantation cysts_ are caused by the accidental transference of
portions of the epidermis into the underlying connective tissue, as may
occur in wounds by needles, awls, forks, or thorns. the implanted
epidermis proliferates and forms a small cyst. they are met with chiefly
on the palmar aspect of the fingers, and vary in size from a split pea
to a cherry. the treatment consists in removing them by dissection.

_parasitic cysts_ are produced by the growth within the tissues of
cyst-forming parasites, the best known being the taenia echinococcus,
which gives rise to the _hydatid cyst_. the liver is by far the most
common site of hydatid cysts in the human subject.

with regard to the further life-history of hydatids, the living elements
of the cyst may die and degenerate, or the cyst may increase in size
until it ruptures. as a result of pyogenic infection the cyst may be
converted into an abscess.

the _clinical features_ of hydatids vary so much with their situation
and size, that they are best discussed with the individual organs. in
general it may be said that there is a slow formation of a globular,
elastic, fluctuating, painless swelling. fluctuation is detected when
the cyst approaches the surface, and it is then also that percussion
may elicit the "hydatid thrill" or fremitus. this thrill is not often
obtainable, and in any case is not pathognomonic of hydatids, as it may
be elicited in ascites and in other abdominal cysts. pressure of the
cyst upon adjacent structures, and the occurrence of suppuration, are
attended with characteristic clinical features.

the _diagnosis_ of hydatids will be considered with the individual
organs. the disease is more common in certain parts of australia and in
shetland and iceland than in countries where the association of dogs in
the domestic life of the inhabitants is less intimate. pfeiler, who has
worked at the _serum diagnosis of hydatid disease_, regards the
complement deviation method as the most reliable; he believes that a
positive reaction may almost be regarded as absolutely diagnostic of an
echinococcal lesion.

the _treatment_ is to excise the cyst completely, or to inject into it a
1 per cent. solution of formalin. in operating upon hydatids the utmost
care must be taken to avoid leakage of the contents of the cyst, as
these may readily disseminate the infection.

a _blood cyst_ or haematoma results from the encapsulation of
extravasated blood in the tissues, from haemorrhage taking place into a
preformed cyst, or from the saccular pouching of a varicose vein.

a _lymph cyst_ usually results from a contusion in which the skin is
forcibly displaced from the subjacent tissues, and lymph vessels are
thereby torn across. the cyst is usually situated between the skin and
fascia, and contains clear or blood-stained serum. at first it is lax
and fluctuates readily, later it becomes larger and more tense. the
treatment consists in drawing off the contents through a hollow needle
and applying firm pressure. apart from injury, lymph cysts are met with
as the result of the distension of lymph spaces and vessels
(_lymphangiectasis_); and in lymphangiomas, of which the best-known
example is the cystic hygroma or hydrocele of the neck.


ganglion

this term is applied to a cyst filled with a clear colourless jelly or
colloid material, met with in the vicinity of a joint or tendon sheath.

the commonest variety--the _carpal ganglion_--popularly known as a
sprained sinew--is met with as a smooth, rounded, or oval swelling on
the dorsal aspect of the carpus, usually towards its radial side (fig. 60).
it is situated over one of the intercarpal or other joints in this
region, and may be connected with one or other of the extensor tendons.
the skin and fascia are movable over the cyst. the cyst varies in size
from a pea to a pigeon's egg, and usually attains its maximum size
within a few months and then remains stationary. it becomes tense and
prominent when the hand is flexed towards the palm. its appearance is
usually ascribed to some strain of the wrist--for example, in girls
learning gymnastics. it may cause no symptoms or it may interfere with
the use of the hand, especially in grasping movements and when the hand
is dorsiflexed. in girls it may give rise to pain which shoots up the
arm. ganglia are also met with on the dorsum of the metacarpus and on
the palmar aspect of the wrist.

[illustration: fig. 60.--carpal ganglion in a woman aet. 25.]

the _tarsal ganglion_ is situated on the dorsum of the foot over one or
other of the intertarsal joints. it is usually smaller, flatter, and
more tense than that met with over the wrist, so that it is sometimes
mistaken for a bony tumour. it rarely causes symptoms, unless so
situated as to be pressed upon by the boot.

_ganglia in the region of the knee_ are usually situated over the
interval between the femur and tibia, most often on the lateral aspect
of the joint in front of the tendon of the biceps (fig. 61). the
swelling, which may attain the size of half a walnut, is tense and hard
when the knee is extended, and becomes softer and more prominent when it
is flexed. they are met with in young adults who follow laborious
occupations or who indulge in athletics, and they cause stiffness,
discomfort, and impairment of the use of the limb. a ganglion is
sometimes met with on the median aspect of the head of the metatarsal
bone of the great toe and may be the cause of considerable suffering; it
is indistinguishable from the thickened and enlarged bursa so commonly
present in this situation in the condition known as bunion.

[illustration: fig. 61.--ganglion on lateral aspect of knee in a young
woman.]

ganglionic cysts are met with in other situations than those mentioned,
but they are so rare as not to require separate description.

ganglia are to be diagnosed by their situation and physical characters;
enlarged bursae, synovial cysts, and new-growths are the swellings most
likely to be mistaken for them. the diagnosis is sometimes only cleared
up by withdrawing the clear, jelly-like contents through a hollow
needle.

_pathological anatomy._--the wall of the cyst is composed of fibrous
tissue closely adherent to or fused with the surrounding tissues, so
that it cannot be shelled out. there is no endothelial lining, and the
fibrous tissue of the wall is in immediate contact with the colloid
material in the interior, which appears to be derived by a process of
degeneration from the surrounding connective tissue. in the region of
the knee the ganglion is usually multilocular, and consists of a
meshwork of fibrous tissue, the meshes of which are occupied by colloid
material.

it is often stated that a ganglion originates from a hernial protrusion
of the synovial membrane of a joint or tendon sheath. we have not been
able to demonstrate any communication between the cavity of the cyst
and that of an adjacent tendon sheath or joint. it is possible, however,
that the cyst may originate from a minute portion of synovial membrane
being protruded and strangulated so that it becomes disconnected from
that to which it originally belonged; it may then degenerate and give
rise to colloid material, which accumulates and forms a cyst. ledderhose
and others regard ganglia as entirely new formations in the
peri-articular tissues, resulting from colloid degeneration of the
fibrous tissue of the capsular ligament, occurring at first in numerous
small areas which later coalesce. ganglia are probably, therefore, of
the nature of degeneration cysts arising in the capsule of joints, in
tendons, and in their sheaths.

_treatment._--a ganglion can usually be got rid of by a modification of
the old-fashioned seton. the skin and cyst wall are transfixed by a
stout needle carrying a double thread of silkworm gut; some of the
colourless jelly escapes from the punctures; the ends of the thread are
tied and cut short, and a dressing is applied. a week later the threads
are removed and the minute punctures are sealed with collodion. the
action of the threads is to convert the cyst wall into granulation
tissue, which undergoes the usual conversion into scar tissue. if the
cyst re-forms, it should be removed by open dissection under local
anaesthesia. puncture with a tenotomy knife and scraping the interior,
and the injection of irritants, are alternative, but less satisfactory,
methods of treatment.

_ganglia_ in the substance of _tendons_ are rare. the diagnosis rests on
the observation that the small tumour is cystic, and that it follows the
movements of the tendon. the cyst is at first multiple, but the
partitions disappear, and the spaces are thrown into one. the tendon is
so weakened that it readily ruptures. the best treatment is to resect
the affected segment of tendon.

the so-called "compound palmar ganglion" is a tuberculous disease of the
tendon sheaths, and is described with diseases of tendon sheaths.

injuries


contusions--wounds: _varieties_--wounds by firearms and
    explosives: _pistol-shot wounds_; _wounds by sporting guns_;
    _wounds by rifle bullets_; _wounds received in warfare_; _shell
    wounds_. _embedded foreign bodies_--burns and
    scalds--injuries produced by electricity: _x-ray and
    radium_; _electrical burns_; _lightning stroke_.


contusions

a contusion or bruise is a laceration of the subcutaneous soft tissues,
without solution of continuity of the skin. when the integument gives
way at the same time, a _contused-wound_ results. bruising occurs when
force is applied to a part by means of a blunt object, whether as a
direct blow, a crush, or a grazing form of violence. if the force acts
at right angles to the part, it tends to produce localised lesions which
extend deeply; while, if it acts obliquely, it gives rise to lesions
which are more diffuse, but comparatively superficial. it is well to
remember that those who suffer from scurvy, or haemophilia (bleeders),
and fat and anaemic females, are liable to be bruised by comparatively
trivial injuries.

_clinical features._--the less severe forms of contusion are associated
with _ecchymosis_, numerous minute and discrete punctate haemorrhages
being scattered through the superficial layers of the skin, which is
slightly oedematous. the effused blood is soon reabsorbed.

the more severe forms are attended with _extravasation_, the
extravasated blood being widely diffused through the cellular tissue of
the part, especially where this is loose and lax, as in the region of
the orbit, the scrotum and perineum, and on the chest wall. a blue or
bluish-black discoloration occurs in patches, varying in size and depth
with the degree of force which produced the injury, and in shape with
the instrument employed. it is most intense in regions where the skin is
naturally thin and pigmented. in parts where the extravasated blood is
only separated from the oxygen of the air by a thin layer of epidermis
or by a mucous membrane, it retains its bright arterial colour. these
points are often well illustrated in cases of black eye, where the blood
effused under the conjunctiva is bright red, while that in the eyelids
is almost black. in severe contusions associated with great tension of
the skin--for example, over the front of the tibia or around the
ankle--blisters often form on the surface and constitute a possible
avenue of infection. when deeply situated, the blood tends to spread
along the lines of least resistance, partly under the influence of
gravity, passing under fasciae, between muscles, along the sheaths of
vessels, or in connective-tissue spaces, so that it may only reach the
surface after some time, and at a considerable distance from the seat of
injury. this fact is sometimes of importance in diagnosis, as, for
example, in certain fractures of the base of the skull, where
discoloration appears under the conjunctiva or behind the mastoid
process some days after the accident.

blood extravasated deeply in the tissues gives rise to a firm,
resistant, doughy swelling, in which there may be elicited on deep
palpation a peculiar sensation, not unlike the crepitus of fracture.

it frequently happens that, from the tearing of lymph vessels, serous
fluid is extravasated, and a _lymphatic_ or _serous cyst_ may form.

in all contusions accompanied by extravasation, there is marked swelling
of the area involved, as well as pain and tenderness. the temperature
may rise to 101 o f., or, in the large extravasations that occur in
bleeders, even higher--a form of aseptic fever. the degree of shock is
variable, but sudden syncope frequently results from severe bruises of
the testicle, abdomen, or head, and occasionally marked nervous
depression follows these injuries.

contusion of muscles or nerves may produce partial atrophy and paresis,
as is often seen after injuries in the region of the shoulder.

in alcoholic or other debilitated patients, suppuration is liable to
ensue in bruised parts, infection taking place from cocci circulating in
the blood, or through the overlying skin.

_terminations of contusions._--the usual termination is a complete
return to the normal, some of the extravasated blood being organised,
but most of it being reabsorbed. during the process characteristic
alterations in the colour of the effused blood take place as a result of
changes in the blood pigment. in from twenty-four to forty-eight hours
the margins of the blue area become of a violet hue, and as time goes on
the discoloured area increases in size, and becomes successively green,
yellow, and lemon-coloured at its margins, the central part being the
last to change. the rate at which this play of colours proceeds is so
variable, and depends on so many circumstances, that no time-limits can
be laid down. during the disintegration of the effused blood the
adjacent lymph glands may become enlarged, and on dissection may be
found to be pigmented. sometimes the blood persists as a collection of
fluid with a newly formed connective-tissue capsule, constituting a
_haematoma_ or _blood cyst_, more often met with in the scalp than in
other parts.

the impairment of the blood supply of the skin may lead to the formation
of _blisters_, or to _necrosis_. death of skin is more liable to occur
in bleeders, and when the slough separates the blood-clot is exposed and
the reparative changes go on extremely slowly. _suppuration_ may occur
and lead to the formation of an abscess as a result of direct infection
from the skin or through the circulation.

_treatment._--if the patient is seen immediately after the accident,
elevation of the part, and firm pressure applied by means of a thick pad
of cotton wool and an elastic bandage, are useful in preventing effusion
of blood. ice-bags and evaporating lotions are to be used with caution,
as they are liable to lower the vitality of the damaged tissues and lead
to necrosis of the skin.

when extravasation has already taken place, massage is the most speedy
and efficacious means of dispersing the effused blood. the part should
be massaged several times a day, unless the presence of blebs or
abrasions of the skin prevents this being done. when this is the case,
the use of antiseptic dressings is called for to prevent infection and
to promote healing, after which massage is employed.

when the tension caused by the extravasated blood threatens the vitality
of the skin, incisions may be made, if asepsis can be assured. the blood
from a haematoma may be withdrawn by an exploring needle, and the
puncture sealed with collodion. infective complications must be looked
for and dealt with on general principles.


wounds

a wound is a solution in the continuity of the skin or mucous membrane
and of the underlying tissues, caused by violence.

three varieties of wounds are described: incised, punctured, and
contused and lacerated.

#incised wounds.#--typical examples of incised wounds are those made by
the surgeon in the course of an operation, wounds accidentally inflicted
by cutting instruments, and suicidal cut-throat wounds. it should be
borne in mind in connection with medico-legal inquiries, that wounds of
soft parts that closely overlie a bone, such as the skull, the tibia, or
the patella, although, inflicted by a blunt instrument, may have all the
appearances of incised wounds.

_clinical features._--one of the characteristic features of an incised
wound is its tendency to gape. this is evident in long skin wounds, and
especially when the cut runs across the part, or when it extends deeply
enough to divide muscular fibres at right angles to their long axis. the
gaping of a wound, further, is more marked when the underlying tissues
are in a state of tension--as, for example, in inflamed parts. incised
wounds in the palm of the hand, the sole of the foot, or the scalp,
however, have little tendency to gape, because of the close attachment
of the skin to the underlying fascia.

incised wounds, especially in inflamed tissues, tend to bleed profusely;
and when a vessel is only partly divided and is therefore unable to
contract, it continues to bleed longer than when completely cut across.

the _special risks_ of incised wounds are: (1) division of large blood
vessels, leading to profuse haemorrhage; (2) division of nerve-trunks,
resulting in motor and sensory disturbances; and (3) division of tendons
or muscles, interfering with movement.

_treatment._--if haemorrhage is still going on, it must be arrested by
pressure, torsion, or ligature, as the accumulation of blood in a wound
interferes with union. if necessary, the wound should be purified by
washing with saline solution or eusol, and the surrounding skin painted
with iodine, after which the edges are approximated by sutures. the raw
surfaces must be brought into accurate apposition, care being taken that
no inversion of the cutaneous surface takes place. in extensive and deep
wounds, to ensure more complete closure and to prevent subsequent
stretching of the scar, it is advisable to unite the different
structures--muscles, fasciae, and subcutaneous tissue--by separate series
of _buried sutures_ of catgut or other absorbable material. for the
approximation of the skin edges, stitches of horse-hair, fishing-gut, or
fine silk are the most appropriate. these _stitches of coaptation_ may
be interrupted or continuous. in small superficial wounds on exposed
parts, stitch marks may be avoided by approximating the edges with
strips of gauze fixed in position by collodion, or by subcutaneous
sutures of fine catgut. where the skin is loose, as, for example, in the
neck, on the limbs, or in the scrotum, the use of michel's clips is
advantageous in so far as these bring the deep surfaces of the skin into
accurate apposition, are introduced with comparatively little pain, and
leave only a slight mark if removed within forty-eight hours.

when there is any difficulty in bringing the edges of the wound into
apposition, a few interrupted _relaxation stitches_ may be introduced
wide of the margins, to take the strain off the coaptation stitches.
stout silk, fishing-gut, or silver wire may be employed for this
purpose. when the tension is extreme, lister's button suture may be
employed. the tension is relieved and death of skin prevented by scoring
it freely with a sharp knife. relaxation stitches should be removed in
four or five days, and stitches of coaptation in from seven to ten days.
on the face and neck, wounds heal rapidly, and stitches may be removed
in two or three days, thus diminishing the marks they leave.

_drainage._--in wounds in which no cavity has been left, and in which
there is no reason to suspect infection, drainage is unnecessary. when,
however, the deeper parts of an extensive wound cannot be brought into
accurate apposition, and especially when there is any prospect of oozing
of blood or serum--as in amputation stumps or after excision of the
breast--drainage is indicated. it is a wise precaution also to insert
drainage tubes into wounds in fat patients when there is the slightest
reason to suspect the presence of infection. glass or rubber tubes are
the best drains; but where it is desirable to leave little mark, a few
strands of horse-hair, or a small roll of rubber, form a satisfactory
substitute. except when infection occurs, the drain is removed in from
one to four days and the opening closed with a michel's clip or a
suture.

#punctured wounds.#--punctured wounds are produced by narrow, pointed
instruments, and the sharper and smoother the instrument the more does
the resulting injury resemble an incised wound; while from more rounded
and rougher instruments the edges of the wound are more or less contused
or lacerated. the depth of punctured wounds greatly exceeds their width,
and the damage to subcutaneous parts is usually greater than that to the
skin. when the instrument transfixes a part, the edges of the wound of
entrance may be inverted, and those of the exit wound everted. if the
instrument is a rough one, these conditions may be reversed by its
sudden withdrawal.

punctured wounds neither gape nor bleed much. even when a large vessel
is implicated, the bleeding usually takes place into the tissues rather
than externally.

the _risks_ incident to this class of wounds are: (1) the extreme
difficulty, especially when a dense fascia has been perforated, of
rendering them aseptic, on account of the uncertainty as to their depth,
and of the way in which the surface wound closes on the withdrawal of
the instrument; (2) different forms of aneurysm may result from the
puncture of a large vessel; (3) perforation of a joint, or of a serous
cavity, such as the abdomen, thorax, or skull, materially adds to the
danger.

_treatment._--the first indication is to purify the whole extent of the
wound, and to remove any foreign body or blood-clot that may be in it.
it is usually necessary to enlarge the wound, freely dividing injured
fasciae, paring away bruised tissues, and purifying the whole
wound-surface. any blood vessel that is punctured should be cut across
and tied; and divided muscles, tendons, or nerves must be sutured. after
haemorrhage has been arrested, iodoform and bismuth paste is rubbed into
the raw surface, and the wound closed. if there is any reason to doubt
the asepticity of the wound, it is better treated by the open method,
and a bier's bandage should be applied.

#contused and lacerated wounds.#--these may be considered together, as
they so occur in practice. they are produced by crushing, biting, or
tearing forms of violence--such as result from machinery accidents,
firearms, or the bites of animals. in addition to the irregular wound of
the integument, there is always more or less bruising of the parts
beneath and around, and the subcutaneous lesions are much wider than
appears on the surface.

wounds of this variety usually gape considerably, especially when there
is much laceration of the skin. it is not uncommon to have considerable
portions of skin, muscle, or tendon completely torn away.

haemorrhage is seldom a prominent feature, as the crushing or tearing of
the vessel wall leads to the obliteration of the lumen.

the _special risks_ of these wounds are: (1) sloughing of the bruised
tissues, especially when attempts to sterilise the wound have not been
successful. (2) reactionary haemorrhage after the initial shock has
passed off. (3) secondary haemorrhage as a result of infective processes
ensuing in the wound. (4) loss of muscle or tendon, interfering with
motion. (5) cicatricial contraction. (6) gangrene, which may follow
occlusion of main vessels, or virulent infective processes. (7) it is
not uncommon to have particles of carbon embedded in the tissues after
lacerated wounds, leaving unsightly, pigmented scars. this is often seen
in coal-miners, and in those injured by firearms, and is to be prevented
by removing all gross dirt from the edges of the wound.

_treatment._--in severe wounds of this class implicating the
extremities, the most important question that arises is whether or not
the limb can be saved. in examining the limb, attention should first be
directed to the state of the main blood vessels, in order to determine
if the vascular supply of the part beyond the lesion is sufficient to
maintain its vitality. amputation is usually called for if there is
complete absence of pulsation in the distal arteries and if the part
beyond is cold. if at the same time important nerve-trunks are
lacerated, so that the function of the limb would be seriously impaired,
it is not worth running the risk of attempting to save it. if, in
addition, there is extensive destruction of large muscular masses or of
important tendons, or comminution of the bones, amputation is usually
imperative. stripping of large areas of skin is not in itself a reason
for removing a limb, as much can be done by skin grafting, but when it
is associated with other lesions it favours amputation. in considering
these points, it must be borne in mind that the damage to the deeper
tissues is always more extensive than appears on the surface, and that
in many cases it is only possible to estimate the real extent of the
injury by administering an anaesthetic and exploring the wound. in
doubtful cases the possibility of rendering the parts aseptic will often
decide the question for or against amputation. if thorough purification
is accomplished, the success which attends conservative measures is
often remarkable. it is permissible to run an amount of risk to save an
upper extremity which would be unjustifiable in the case of a lower
limb. the age and occupation of the patient must also be taken into
account.

it having been decided to try and save the limb, the question is only
settled for the moment; it may have to be reconsidered from day to day,
or even from hour to hour, according to the progress of the case.

when it is decided to make the attempt to save the limb, the wound must
be thoroughly purified. all bruised tissue in which gross dirt has
become engrained should be cut away with knife or scissors. the raw
surface is then cleansed with eusol, washed with sterilised salt
solution followed by methylated spirit, and rubbed all over with "bipp"
paste. if the purification is considered satisfactory the wound may be
closed, otherwise it is left open, freely drained or packed with gauze,
and the limb is immobilised by suitable splints.


wounds by firearms and explosives

it is not necessary here to do more than indicate the general characters
of wounds produced by modern weapons. for further details the reader is
referred to works on military surgery. experience has shown that the
nature and severity of the injuries sustained in warfare vary widely in

different campaigns, and even in different fields of the same campaign.
slight variations in the size, shape, and weight of rifle bullets, for
example, may profoundly modify the lesions they produce: witness the
destructive effect of the pointed bullet compared with that of the
conical form previously used. the conditions under which the fighting is
carried on also influence the wounds. those sustained in the open,
long-range fighting of the south african campaign of 1899-1902 were very
different from those met with in the entrenched warfare in france in
1914-1918. it has been found also that the infective complications are
greatly influenced by the terrain in which the fighting takes place. in
the dry, sandy, uncultivated veldt of south africa, bullet wounds seldom
became infected, while those sustained in the highly manured fields of
belgium were almost invariably contaminated with putrefactive organisms,
and gaseous gangrene and tetanus were common complications. it has been
found also that wounds inflicted in naval engagements present different
characters from those sustained on land. many other factors, such as the
physical and mental condition of the men, the facilities for affording
first aid, and the transport arrangements, also play a part in
determining the nature and condition of the wounds that have to be dealt
with by military surgeons.

whatever the nature of the weapon concerned, the wound is of the
_punctured, contused, and lacerated_ variety. its severity depends on
the size, shape, and velocity of the missile, the range at which the
weapon is discharged, and the part of the body struck.

shock is a prominent feature, but its degree, as well as the time of its
onset, varies with the extent and seat of the injury, and with the
mental state of the patient when wounded. we have observed pronounced
shock in children after being shot even when no serious injury was
sustained. at the moment of injury the patient experiences a sensation
which is variously described as being like the lash of a whip, a blow
with a stick, or an electric shock. there is not much pain at first, but
later it may become severe, and is usually associated with intense
thirst, especially when much blood has been lost.

in all forms of wounds sustained in warfare, septic infection
constitutes the main risk, particularly that resulting from
streptococci. the presence of anaerobic organisms introduces the
additional danger of gaseous forms of gangrene.

the earlier the wound is disinfected the greater is the possibility of
diminishing this risk. if cleansing is carried out within the first six
hours the chance of eliminating sepsis is good; with every succeeding
six hours it diminishes, until after twenty-four hours it is seldom
possible to do more than mitigate sepsis. (j. t. morrison.)

the presence of a metallic foreign body having been determined and its
position localised by means of the x-rays, all devitalised and
contaminated tissue is excised, the foreign material, _e.g._, a missile,
fragments of clothing, gravel and blood-clot, removed, the wound
purified with antiseptics and closed or drained according to
circumstances.

#pistol-shot wounds.#--wounds inflicted by pistols, revolvers, and small
air-guns are of frequent occurrence in civil practice, the weapon being
discharged usually by accident, but frequently with suicidal, and
sometimes with homicidal intent.

with all calibres and at all ranges, except actual contact, the wound of
entrance is smaller than the bullet. if the weapon is discharged within
a foot of the body, the skin surrounding the wound is usually stained
with powder and burned, and the hair singed. at ranges varying from six
inches to thirty feet, grains of powder may be found embedded in the
skin or lying loose on the surface, the greater the range the wider
being the area of spread. when black powder is used, the embedded grains
usually leave a permanent bluish-black tattooing of the skin. when the
weapon is placed in contact with the skin, the subcutaneous tissues are
lacerated over an area of two or three inches around the opening made by
the bullet and smoke and powder-staining and scorching are more marked
than at longer ranges.

when the bullet perforates, the exit wound is usually larger and more
extensively lacerated than the wound of entrance. its margins are as a
rule everted, and it shows no marks of flame, smoke, or powder. these
features are common to all perforations caused by bullets.

pistol wounds only produce dangerous effects when fired at close range,
and when the cavities of the skull, the thorax, or the abdomen are
implicated. in the abdomen a lethal injury may readily be caused even by
pistols of the "toy" order. these injuries will be described with
regional surgery.

pistol-shot wounds of _joints_ and _soft parts_ are seldom of serious
import apart from the risk of haemorrhage and of infection.

_treatment._--the treatment of wounds of the soft parts consists in
purifying the wounds of entrance and exit and the surrounding skin, and
in providing for drainage if this is indicated.

there being no urgency for the removal of the bullet, time should be
taken to have it localised by the x-rays, preferably by stereoscopic
plates. in some cases it is not necessary to remove the bullet.

#wounds by sporting guns.#--in the common sporting or scatter gun, with
which accidents so commonly occur during the shooting season, the charge
of small shot or pellets leave the muzzle of the gun as a solid mass
which makes a single ragged wound having much the appearance of that
caused by a single bullet. at a distance of from four to five feet from
the muzzle the pellets begin to disperse so that there are separate
punctures around the main central wound. as the range increases, these
outlying punctures make a wider and wider pattern, until at a distance
of from eighteen to twenty feet from the muzzle, the scattering is
complete, there is no longer any central wound, and each individual
pellet makes its own puncture. from these elementary data, it is usually
possible, from the features of the wound, to arrive at an approximately
accurate conclusion regarding the range at which the gun was discharged,
and this may have an important bearing on the question of accident,
suicide, or murder.

as regards the effects on the tissues at close range, that is, within a
few feet, there is widespread laceration and disruption; if a bone is
struck it is shattered, and portions of bone may be displaced or even
driven out through the exit wound.

when the charge impinges over one of the large cavities of the body, the
shot may scatter widely through the contained viscera, and there is
often no exit wound. in the thorax, for example, if a rib is struck, the
charge and possibly fragments of bone, will penetrate the pleura, and be
dispersed throughout the lung; in the head, the skull may be shattered
and the brain torn up; and in the abdomen, the hollow viscera may be
perforated in many places and the solid organs lacerated.

on covered parts the clothing, by deflecting the shot, influences the
size and shape of the wound; the entrance wound is increased in size and
more ragged, and portions of the clothes may be driven into the tissues.

[illustration: fig. 62.--radiogram showing pellets embedded in arm.

(mr. j. w. dowden's case.)]

a charge of small shot is much more destructive to blood vessels,
tendons, and ligaments than a single bullet, which in many cases pushes
such structures aside without dividing them. in the abdomen and chest,
also, the damage done by a full charge of shot is much more extensive
than that inflicted by a single bullet, the deflection of the pellets
leading to a greater number of perforations of the intestine and more
widespread laceration of solid viscera.

when the charge impinges on one of the extremities at close range, we
often have the opportunity of observing that the exit wound is larger,
more ragged than that of entrance, and that its edges are everted; the
extensive tearing and bruising of all the tissues, including the bones,
and the marked tendency to early and progressive septic infection,
render amputation compulsory in the majority of such cases.

at a range of from twenty to thirty feet, although the scatter is
complete, the pellets are still close together, so that if they
encounter the shaft of a long bone, even the femur, they fracture the
bone across, often along with some longitudinal splintering.

individual pellets striking the shafts of long bones become flattened or
distorted, and when cancellated bone is struck they become embedded in
it (fig. 62).

the skin, when it is closely peppered with shot, is liable to lose its
vitality, and with the addition of a little sepsis, readily necroses and
comes away as a slough.

when the shot have diverged so as to strike singly, they seldom do much
harm, but fatal damage may be done to the brain or to the aorta, or the
eye may be seriously injured by a single pellet.

small shot fired at longer ranges--over about a hundred and fifty
feet--usually go through the skin, but seldom pierce the fascia, and lie
embedded in the subcutaneous tissue, from which they can readily be
extracted.

the wad of the cartridge behaves erratically: so long as it remains flat
it goes off with the rest of the charge, and is often buried in the
wound; but if it curls up or turns on its side, it is usually deflected
and flies clear of the shot. it may make a separate wound.

wounds from sporting guns are to be _treated_ on the usual lines, the
early efforts being directed to the alleviation of shock and the
prevention of septic infection. there is rarely any urgency in the
removal of pellets from the tissues.

#wounds by rifle bullets.#--the vast majority of wounds inflicted by
rifle bullets are met with in the field during active warfare, and fall
to be treated by military surgeons. they occasionally occur
accidentally, however, during range practice for example, and may then
come under the notice of the civil surgeon.

it is only necessary here to consider the effects of modern small-bore
rifle or machine-gun bullets.

the trajectory is practically flat up to 675 yards. in destructive
effect there is not much difference between the various high velocity
bullets used in different armies; they will kill up to a distance of two
miles. the hard covering is employed to enable the bullet to take the
grooves in the rifle, and to prevent it stripping as it passes through
the barrel. it also increases the penetrating power of the missile, but
diminishes its "stopping" power, unless a vital part or a long bone is
struck. by removing the covering from the point of the bullet, as is
done in the dum-dum bullet, or by splitting the end, the bullet is made
to expand or "mushroom" when it strikes the body, and its stopping power
is thereby greatly increased, the resulting wound being much more
severe. these "soft-nosed" expanding bullets are to be distinguished
from "explosive" bullets which contain substances which detonate on
impact. high velocity bullets are unlikely to lodge in the body unless
spent, or pulled up by a sandbag, or metal buckle on a belt, or a book
in the pocket, or the core and the case separating--"stripping" of the
bullet. spent shot may merely cause bruising of the surface, or they may
pass through the skin and lodge in the subcutaneous tissue, or may even
damage some deeper structure such as a nerve trunk.

a blank cartridge fired at close range may cause a severe wound, and, if
charged with black powder, may leave a permanent bluish-black
pigmentation of the skin.

the lesions of individual tissues--bones, nerves, blood vessels--are
considered with these.

#treatment of gunshot wounds under war conditions.#--it is only
necessary to indicate briefly the method of dealing with gunshot wounds
in warfare as practised in the european war.

1. _on the field._--haemorrhage is arrested in the limbs by an improvised
tourniquet; in the head by a pad and bandage; in the thorax or abdomen
by packing if necessary, but this should be avoided if possible, as it
favours septic infection. if a limb is all but detached it should be
completely severed. a full dose of morphin is given hypodermically. the
ampoule of iodine carried by the wounded man is broken, and its contents
are poured over and around the wound, after which the field dressing is
applied. in extensive wounds, the "shell-dressing" carried by the
stretcher bearers is preferred. all bandages are applied loosely to
allow for subsequent swelling. the fragments of fractured bones are
immobilised by some form of emergency splint.

2. _at the advanced dressing station_, after the patient has had a
liberal allowance of warm fluid nourishment, such as soup or tea, a full
dose of anti-tetanic serum is injected. the tourniquet is removed and
the wound inspected. urgent amputations are performed. moribund patients
are detained lest they die _en route_.

3. _in the field ambulance or casualty clearing station_ further
measures are employed for the relief of shock, and urgent operations are
performed, such as amputation for gangrene, tracheotomy for dyspnoea, or
laparotomy for perforated or lacerated intestine. in the majority of
cases the main object is to guard against infection; the skin is
disinfected over a wide area and surrounded with towels; damaged tissue,
especially muscle, is removed with the knife or scissors, and foreign
bodies are extracted. torn blood vessels, and, if possible, nerves and
tendons are repaired. the wound is then partly closed, provision being
made for free drainage, or some special method of irrigation, such as
that of carrel, is adopted. sometimes the wound is treated with bismuth,
iodoform, and paraffin paste (b.i.p.p.) and sutured.

4. _in the base hospital or hospital ship_ various measures may be
called for according to the progress of the wound and the condition of
the patient.

#shell wounds and wounds produced by explosions.#--it is convenient to
consider together the effects of the bursting of shells fired from heavy
ordnance and those resulting in the course of blasting operations from
the discharge of dynamite or other explosives, or from the bursting of
steam boilers or pipes, the breaking of machinery, and similar accidents
met with in civil practice.

wounds inflicted by shell fragments and shrapnel bullets tend to be
extensive in area, and show great contusion, laceration, and destruction
of the tissues. the missiles frequently lodge and carry portions of the
clothing and, it may be, articles from the man's pocket, with them.
shell wounds are attended with a considerable degree of shock. on
account of the wide area of contusion which surrounds the actual wound
produced by shell fragments, amputation, when called for, should be
performed some distance above the torn tissues, as there is considerable
risk of sloughing of the flaps.

wounds produced by dynamite explosions and the bursting of boilers have
the same general characters as shell wounds. fragments of stone, coal,
or metal may lodge in the tissues, and favour the occurrence of
infective complications.

all such injuries are to be treated on the general principles governing
contused and lacerated wounds.


embedded foreign bodies

in the course of many operations foreign substances are introduced into
the tissues and intentionally left there, for example, suture and
ligature materials, steel or aluminium plates, silver wire or ivory pegs
used to secure the fixation of bones, or solid paraffin employed to
correct deformities. other substances, such as gauze, drainage tubes,
or metal instruments, may be unintentionally left in a wound.

foreign bodies may also lodge in accidentally inflicted wounds, for
example, bullets, needles, splinters of wood, or fragments of clothing.
the needles of hypodermic syringes sometimes break and a portion remains
embedded in the tissues. as a result of explosions, particles of carbon,
in the form of coal-dust or gunpowder, or portions of shale, may lodge
in a wound.

the embedded foreign body at first acts as an irritant, and induces a
reaction in the tissues in which it lodges, in the form of hyperaemia,
local leucocytosis, proliferation of fibroblasts, and the formation of
granulation tissue. the subsequent changes depend upon whether or not
the wound is infected with pyogenic bacteria. if it is so infected,
suppuration ensues, a sinus forms, and persists until the foreign body
is either cast out or removed.

if the wound is aseptic, the fate of the foreign body varies with its
character. a substance that is absorbable, such as catgut or fine silk,
is surrounded and permeated by the phagocytes, which soften and
disintegrate it, the debris being gradually absorbed in much the same
manner as a fibrinous exudate. minute bodies that are not capable of
being absorbed, such as particles of carbon, or of pigment used in
tattooing, are taken up by the phagocytes, and in course of time
removed. larger bodies, such as needles or bullets, which are not
capable of being destroyed by the phagocytes, become encapsulated. in
the granulation tissue by which they are surrounded large multinuclear
giant-cells appear ("_foreign-body giant-cells_") and attach themselves
to the foreign body, the fibroblasts proliferate and a capsule of scar
tissue is eventually formed around the body. the tissues of the capsule
may show evidence of iron pigmentation. sometimes fluid accumulates
around a foreign body within its capsule, constituting a cyst.

substances like paraffin, strands of silk used to bridge a gap in a
tendon, or portions of calcined bone, instead of being encapsulated, are
gradually permeated and eventually replaced by new connective tissue.

embedded bodies may remain in the tissues for an indefinite period
without giving rise to inconvenience. at any time, however, they may
cause trouble, either as a result of infective complications, or by
inducing the formation of a mass of inflammatory tissue around them,
which may simulate a gumma, a tuberculous focus, or a sarcoma. this
latter condition may give rise to difficulties in diagnosis,
particularly if there is no history forthcoming of the entrance of the
foreign body. the ignorance of patients regarding the possible lodgment
in the tissues of a foreign body--even of considerable size--is
remarkable. in such cases the x-rays will reveal the presence of the
foreign body if it is sufficiently opaque to cast a shadow. the heavy,
lead-containing varieties of glass throw very definite shadows little
inferior in sharpness and definition to those of metal; almost all the
ordinary forms of commercial glass also may be shown up by the x-rays.

foreign bodies encapsulated in the peritoneal cavity are specially
dangerous, as the proximity of the intestine furnishes a constant
possibility of infection.

the question of removal of the foreign body must be decided according to
the conditions present in individual cases; in searching for a foreign
body in the tissues, unless it has been accurately located, a general
anaesthetic is to be preferred.


burns and scalds

the distinction between a burn which results from the action of dry heat
on the tissues of the body and a scald which results from the action of
moist heat, has no clinical significance.

in young and debilitated subjects hot poultices may produce injuries of
the nature of burns. in old people with enfeebled circulation mere
exposure to a strong fire may cause severe degrees of burning, the
clothes covering the part being uninjured. this may also occur about the
feet, legs, or knees of persons while intoxicated who have fallen asleep
before the fire.

the damage done to the tissues by strong caustics, such as fuming nitric
acid, sulphuric acid, caustic potash, nitrate of silver, or arsenical
paste, presents pathological and clinical features almost identical with
those resulting from heat. electricity and the rontgen rays also produce
lesions of the nature of burns.

_pathology of burns._--much discussion has taken place regarding the
explanation of the rapidly fatal issue in extensive superficial burns.
on post-mortem examination the lesions found in these cases are: (1)
general hyperaemia of all the organs of the abdominal, thoracic, and
cerebro-spinal cavities; (2) marked leucocytosis, with destruction of
red corpuscles, setting free haemoglobin which lodges in the epithelial
cells of the tubules of the kidneys; (3) minute thrombi and
extravasations throughout the tissues of the body; (4) degeneration of
the ganglion cells of the solar plexus; (5) oedema and degeneration of
the lymphoid tissue throughout the body; (6) cloudy swelling of the
liver and kidneys, and softening and enlargement of the spleen. bardeen
suggests that these morbid phenomena correspond so closely to those met
with where the presence of a toxin is known to produce them, that in all
probability death is similarly due to the action of some poison produced
by the action of heat on the skin and on the proteins of the blood.

#clinical features--local phenomena.#--the most generally accepted
classification of burns is that of dupuytren, which is based upon the
depth of the lesion. six degrees are thus, recognised: (1) hyperaemia or
erythema; (2) vesication; (3) partial destruction of the true skin; (4)
total destruction of the true skin; (5) charring of muscles; (6)
charring of bones.

it must be observed, however, that burns met with at the bedside always
illustrate more than one of these degrees, the deeper forms always being
associated with those less deep, and the clinical picture is made up of
the combined characters of all. a burn is classified in terms of its
most severe portion. it is also to be remarked that the extent and
severity of a burn usually prove to be greater than at first sight
appears.

_burns of the first degree_ are associated with erythema of the skin,
due to hyperaemia of its blood vessels, and result from scorching by
flame, from contact with solids or fluids below 212 o f., or from
exposure to the sun's rays. they are characterised clinically by acute
pain, redness, transitory swelling from oedema, and subsequent
desquamation of the surface layers of the epidermis. a special form of
pigmentation of the skin is seen on the front of the legs of women from
exposure to the heat of the fire.

_burns of second degree--vesication of the skin._--these are
characterised by the occurrence of vesicles or blisters which are
scattered over the hyperaemic area, and contain a clear yellowish or
brownish fluid. on removing the raised epidermis, the congested and
highly sensitive papillae of the skin are exposed. unna has found that
pyogenic bacteria are invariably present in these blisters. burns of the
second degree leave no scar but frequently a persistent discoloration.
in rare instances the burned area becomes the seat of a peculiar
overgrowth of fibrous tissue of the nature of keloid (p 401).

_burns of third degree--partial destruction of the skin._--the epidermis
and papillae are destroyed in patches, leaving hard, dry, and insensitive
sloughs of a yellow or black colour. the pain in these burns is
intense, but passes off during the first or second day, to return again,
however, when, about the end of a week, the sloughs separate and expose
the nerve filaments of the underlying skin. granulations spring up to
fill the gap, and are rapidly covered by epithelium, derived partly from
the margins and partly from the remains of skin glands which have not
been completely destroyed. these latter appear on the surface of the
granulations as small bluish islets which gradually increase in size,
become of a greyish-white colour, and ultimately blend with one another
and with the edges. the resulting cicatrix may be slightly depressed,
but otherwise exhibits little tendency to contract and cause deformity.

_burns of fourth degree--total destruction of the skin._--these follow
the more prolonged action of any form of intense heat. large, black, dry
eschars are formed, surrounded by a zone of intense congestion. pain is
less severe, and is referred to the parts that have been burned to a
less degree. infection is liable to occur and to lead to wide
destruction of the surrounding skin. the amount of granulation tissue
necessary to fill the gap is therefore great; and as the epithelial
covering can only be derived from the margins--the skin glands being
completely destroyed--the healing process is slow. the resulting scars
are irregular, deep and puckered, and show a great tendency to contract.
keloid frequently develops in such cicatrices. when situated in the
region of the face, neck, or flexures of joints, much deformity and
impairment of function may result (fig. 63).

[illustration: fig. 63.--cicatricial contraction following severe burn.]

in _burns of the fifth degree_ the lesion extends through the
subcutaneous tissue and involves the muscles; while in those of the
_sixth degree_ it passes still more deeply and implicates the bones.
these burns are comparatively limited in area, as they are usually
produced by prolonged contact with hot metal or caustics. burns of the
fifth and sixth degrees are met with in epileptics or intoxicated
persons who fall into the fire. large blood vessels, nerve-trunks,
joints, or serous cavities may be implicated.

#general phenomena.#--it is customary to divide the clinical history of
a severe burn into three periods; but it is to be observed that the
features characteristic of the periods have been greatly modified since
burns have been treated on the same lines as other wounds.

_the first period_ lasts for from thirty-six to forty-eight hours,
during which time the patient remains in a more or less profound state
of _shock_, and there is a remarkable absence of pain. when shock is
absent or little marked, however, the amount of suffering may be great.
when the injury proves fatal during this period, death is due to shock,
probably aggravated by the absorption of poisonous substances produced
in the burned tissues. in fatal cases there is often evidence of
cerebral congestion and oedema.

the _second period_ begins when the shock passes off, and lasts till the
sloughs separate. the outstanding feature of this period is _toxaemia_,
manifested by fever, the temperature rising to 102 o, 103 o, or 104 o f.,
and congestive or inflammatory conditions of internal organs, giving
rise to such clinical complications as bronchitis, broncho-pneumonia, or
pleurisy--especially in burns of the thorax; or meningitis and
cerebritis, when the neck or head is the seat of the burn. intestinal
catarrh associated with diarrhoea is not uncommon; and ulceration of the
duodenum leading to perforation has been met with in a few cases. these
phenomena are much more prominent when bacterial infection has taken
place, and it seems probable that they are to be attributed chiefly to
the infection, as they have become less frequent and less severe since
burns have been treated like other breaches of the surface. albuminuria
is a fairly constant symptom in severe burns, and is associated with
congestion of the kidneys. in burns implicating the face, neck, mouth,
or pharynx, oedema of the glottis is a dangerous complication, entailing
as it does the risk of suffocation.

the _third period_ begins when the sloughs separate, usually between
the seventh and fourteenth days, and lasts till the wound heals, its
duration depending upon the size, depth, and asepticity of the raw area.
the chief causes of death during this period are toxin absorption in any
of its forms; waxy disease of the liver, kidneys, or intestine; less
commonly erysipelas, tetanus, or other diseases due to infection by
specific organisms. we have seen nothing to substantiate the belief that
duodenal ulcers are liable to perforate during the third period.

the _prognosis_ in burns depends on (1) the superficial extent, and, to
a much less degree, the depth of the injury. when more than one-third of
the entire surface of the body is involved, even in a mild degree, the
prognosis is grave. (2) the situation of the burn is important. burns
over the serous cavities--abdomen, thorax, or skull--are, other things
being equal, much more dangerous than burns of the limbs. the risk of
oedema of the glottis in burns about the neck and mouth has already been
referred to. (3) children are more liable to succumb to shock during the
early period, but withstand prolonged suppuration better than adults.
(4) when the patient survives the shock, the presence or absence of
infection is the all-important factor in prognosis.

#treatment.#--the _general treatment_ consists in combating the shock.
when pain is severe, morphin must be injected.

_local treatment._--the local treatment must be carried out on
antiseptic lines, a general anaesthetic being administered, if necessary,
to enable the purification to be carried out thoroughly. after carefully
removing the clothing, the whole of the burned area is gently, but
thoroughly, cleansed with peroxide of hydrogen or warm boracic lotion,
followed by sterilised saline solution. as pyogenic bacteria are
invariably found in the blisters of burns, these must be opened and the
raised epithelium removed.

the dressings subsequently applied should meet the following
indications: the relief of pain; the prevention of sepsis; and the
promotion of cicatrisation.

an application which satisfactorily fulfils these requirements is
_picric acid_. pads of lint or gauze are lightly wrung out of a solution
made up of picric acid, 1 1/2 drams; absolute alcohol, 3 ounces;
distilled water, 40 ounces, and applied over the whole of the reddened
area. these are covered with antiseptic wool, _without_ any waterproof
covering, and retained in position by a many-tailed bandage. the
dressing should be changed once or twice a week, under the guidance of
the temperature chart, any portion of the original dressing which
remains perfectly dry being left undisturbed. the value of a general
anaesthetic in dressing extensive burns, especially in children, can
scarcely be overestimated.

picric acid yields its best results in superficial burns, and it is
useful as _a primary dressing_ in all. as soon as the sloughs separate
and a granulating surface forms, the ordinary treatment for a healing
sore is instituted. any slough under which pus has collected should be
cut away with scissors to permit of free drainage.

an occlusive dressing of melted _paraffin_ has also been employed. a
useful preparation consists of: paraffin molle 25 per cent., paraffin
durum 67 per cent., olive oil 5 per cent., oil of eucalyptus 2 per
cent., and beta-naphthol 1/4 per cent. it has a melting point of 48 o c.
it is also known as _ambrine_ and _burnol_. after the burned area has
been cleansed and thoroughly dried, it is sponged or painted with the
melted paraffin, and before solidification takes place a layer of
sterilised gauze is applied and covered with a second coating of
paraffin. further coats of paraffin are applied every other day to
prevent the gauze sticking to the skin.

an alternative method of treating extensive burns is by immersing the
part, or even the whole body when the trunk is affected, in a bath of
boracic lotion kept at the body temperature, the lotion being frequently
renewed.

if a burn is already infected when first seen, it is to be treated on
the same principles as govern the treatment of other infected wounds.

all moist or greasy applications, such as carron oil, carbolic oil and
ointments, and all substances like collodion and dry powders, which
retain discharges, entirely fail to meet the indications for the
rational treatment of burns, and should be abandoned.

skin-grafting is of great value in hastening healing after extensive
burns, and in preventing cicatricial contraction. the _deformities_
which are so liable to develop from contraction of the cicatrices are
treated on general principles. in the region of the face, neck, and
flexures of joints (fig. 63), where they are most marked, the contracted
bands may be divided and the parts stretched, the raw surface left being
covered by thiersch grafts or by flaps of skin raised from adjacent
surfaces or from other parts of the body (fig. 1).


injuries produced by electricity

#injuries produced by exposure to x-rays and radium.#--in the routine
treatment of disease by radiations, injury is sometimes done to the
tissues, even when the greatest care is exercised as to dosage and
frequency of application. robert knox describes the following
ill-effects.

_acute dermatitis_ varying in degree from a slight erythema to deep
ulceration or even necrosis of skin. when ulcers form they are extremely
painful and slow to heal. when hair-bearing areas are affected,
epilation may occur without destroying the hair follicles and the hairs
are reproduced, but if the reaction is excessive permanent alopecia may
result.

_chronic dermatitis_, which results from persistence of the acute form,
is most intractable and may assume malignant characters. x-ray warts are
a late manifestation of chronic dermatitis and may become malignant.

among the _late manifestations_ are neuritis, telangiectasis, and a
painful and intractable form of ulceration, any of which may come on
months or even years after the cessation of exposure. _sterility_ may be
induced in x-ray workers who are imperfectly protected from the effects
of the rays.

#electrical burns# usually occur in those who are engaged in industrial
undertakings where powerful electrical currents are employed.

the lesions--which vary from a slight superficial scorching to complete
charring of parts--are most evident at the points of entrance and exit
of the current, the intervening tissues apparently escaping injury.

the more superficial degrees of electrical burns differ from those
produced by heat in being almost painless, and in healing very slowly,
although as a rule they remain dry and aseptic.

the more severe forms are attended with a considerable degree of shock,
which is not only more profound, but also lasts much longer than the
shock in an ordinary burn of corresponding severity. the parts at the
point of entrance of the current are charred to a greater or lesser
depth. the eschar is at first dry and crisp, and is surrounded by a zone
of pallor. for the first thirty-six to forty-eight hours there is
comparatively little suffering, but at the end of that time the parts
become exceedingly painful. in a majority of cases, in spite of careful
purification, a slow form of moist gangrene sets in, and the slough
spreads both in area and in depth, until the muscles and often the
large blood vessels and nerves are exposed. a line of demarcation
eventually forms, but the sloughs are exceedingly slow to separate,
taking from three to five times as long as in an ordinary burn, and
during the process of separation there is considerable risk of secondary
haemorrhage from erosion of large vessels.

_treatment._--electrical burns are treated on the same lines as ordinary
burns, by thorough purification and the application of dry dressings,
with a view to avoiding the onset of moist gangrene. after granulations
have formed, skin-grafting is of value in hastening healing.

#lightning-stroke.#--in a large proportion of cases lightning-stroke
proves instantly fatal. in non-fatal cases the patient suffers from a
profound degree of shock, and there may or may not be any external
evidence of injury. in the mildest cases red spots or wheals--closely
resembling those of urticaria--may appear on the body, but they usually
fade again in the course of twenty-four hours. sometimes large patches
of skin are scorched or stained, the discoloured area showing an
arborescent appearance. in other cases the injured skin becomes dry and
glazed, resembling parchment. appearances are occasionally met with
corresponding to those of a superficial burn produced by heat. the chief
difference from ordinary burns is the extreme slowness with which
healing takes place. localised paralysis of groups of muscles, or even
of a whole limb, may follow any degree of lightning-stroke. treatment is
mainly directed towards combating the shock, the surface-lesions being
treated on the same lines as ordinary burns.




chapter xii

methods of wound treatment


varieties of wounds--modes of infection--lister's work--means taken to
    prevent infection of wounds: _heat_; _chemical antiseptics_;
    _disinfection of hands_; _preparation of skin of patient_;
    _instruments_; _ligatures_; _dressings_--means taken to combat
    infection: _purification_; _open-wound method_.

the surgeon is called upon to treat two distinct classes of wounds: (1)
those resulting from injury or disease in which _the skin is already
broken_, or in which a communication with a mucous surface exists; and
(2) those that he himself makes _through intact skin_, no infected
mucous surface being involved.

infection by bacteria must be assumed to have taken place in all wounds
made in any other way than by the knife of the surgeon operating through
unbroken skin. on this assumption the modern system of wound treatment
is based. pathogenic bacteria are so widely distributed, that in the
ordinary circumstances of everyday life, no matter how trivial a wound
may be, or how short a time it may remain exposed, the access of
organisms to it is almost certain unless preventive measures are
employed.

it cannot be emphasised too strongly that rigid precautions are to be
taken to exclude fresh infection, not only in dealing with wounds that
are free of organisms, but equally in the management of wounds and other
lesions that are already infected. any laxity in our methods which
admits of fresh organisms reaching an infected wound adds materially to
the severity of the infective process and consequently to the patient's
risk.

there are many ways in which accidental infection may occur. take, for
example, the case of a person who receives a cut on the face by being
knocked down in a carriage accident on the street. organisms may be
introduced to such a wound from the shaft or wheel by which he was
struck, from the ground on which he lay, from any portion of his
clothing that may have come in contact with the wound, or from his own
skin. or, again, the hands of those who render first aid, the water used
to bathe the wound, the handkerchief or other extemporised dressing
applied to it, may be the means of conveying bacterial infection. should
the wound open on a mucous surface, such as the mouth or nasal cavity,
the organisms constantly present in such situations are liable to prove
agents of infection.

even after the patient has come under professional care the risks of his
wound becoming infected are not past, because the hands of the doctor,
his instruments, dressings, or other appliances may all, unless
purified, become the sources of infection.

in the case of an operation carried out through unbroken skin, organisms
may be introduced into the wound from the patient's own skin, from the
hands of the surgeon or his assistants, through the medium of
contaminated instruments, swabs, ligature or suture materials, or other
things used in the course of the operation, or from the dressings
applied to the wound.

further, bacteria may gain access to devitalised tissues by way of the
blood-stream, being carried hither from some infected area elsewhere in

_the antiseptic system of surgery._--those who only know the surgical
conditions of to-day can scarcely realise the state of matters which
existed before the introduction of the antiseptic system by joseph
lister in 1867. in those days few wounds escaped the ravages of pyogenic
and other bacteria, with the result that suppuration ensued after most
operations, and such diseases as erysipelas, pyaemia, and "hospital
gangrene" were of everyday occurrence. the mortality after compound
fractures, amputations, and many other operations was appalling, and
death from blood-poisoning frequently followed even the most trivial
operations. an operation was looked upon as a last resource, and the
inherent risk from blood-poisoning seemed to have set an impassable
barrier to the further progress of surgery. to the genius of lister we
owe it that this barrier was removed. having satisfied himself that the
septic process was due to bacterial infection, he devised a means of
preventing the access of organisms to wounds or of counteracting their
effects. carbolic acid was the first antiseptic agent he employed, and
by its use in compound fractures he soon obtained results such as had
never before been attained. the principle was applied to other
conditions with like success, and so profoundly has it affected the
whole aspect of surgical pathology, that many of the infective diseases
with which surgeons formerly had to deal are now all but unknown. the
broad principles upon which lister founded his system remain unchanged,
although the methods employed to put them into practice have been
modified.

#means taken to prevent infection of wounds.#--the avenues by which
infective agents may gain access to surgical wounds are so numerous and
so wide, that it requires the greatest care and the most watchful
attention on the part of the surgeon to guard them all. it is only by
constant practice and patient attention to technical details in the
operating room and at the bedside, that the carrying out of surgical
manipulations in such a way as to avoid bacterial infection will become
an instinctive act and a second nature. it is only possible here to
indicate the chief directions in which danger lies, and to describe the
means most generally adopted to avoid it.

to prevent infection, it is essential that everything which comes into
contact with a wound should be sterilised or disinfected, and to ensure
the best results it is necessary that the efficiency of our methods of
sterilisation should be periodically tested. the two chief agencies at
our disposal are heat and chemical antiseptics.

#sterilisation by heat.#--the most reliable, and at the same time the
most convenient and generally applicable, means of sterilisation is by
heat. all bacteria and spores are completely destroyed by being
subjected for fifteen minutes to _saturated circulating steam_ at a
temperature of 130 o to 145 o c. (= 266 o to 293 o f.). the articles to be
sterilised are enclosed in a perforated tin casket, which is placed in a
specially constructed steriliser, such as that of schimmelbusch. this
apparatus is so arranged that the steam circulates under a pressure of
from two to three atmospheres, and permeates everything contained in it.
objects so sterilised are dry when removed from the steriliser. this
method is specially suitable for appliances which are not damaged by
steam, such, for example, as gauze swabs, towels, aprons, gloves, and
metal instruments; it is essential that the efficiency of the steriliser
be tested from time to time by a self-registering thermometer or other
means.

the best substitute for circulating steam is _boiling_. the articles are
placed in a "fish-kettle steriliser" and boiled for fifteen minutes in a
1 per cent. solution of washing soda.

to prevent contamination of objects that have been sterilised they must
on no account be touched by any one whose hands have not been
disinfected and protected by sterilised gloves.

#sterilisation by chemical agents.#--for the purification of the skin of
the patient, the hands of the surgeon, and knives and other instruments
that are damaged by heat, recourse must be had to chemical agents.
these, however, are less reliable than heat, and are open to certain
other objections.

#disinfection of the hands.#--it is now generally recognised that one of
the most likely sources of wound infection is the hands of the surgeon
and his assistants. it is only by carefully studying to avoid all
contact with infective matter that the hands can be kept surgically
pure, and that this source of wound infection can be reduced to a
minimum. the risk of infection from this source has further been greatly
reduced by the systematic use of rubber gloves by house-surgeons,
dressers, and nurses. the habitual use of gloves has also been adopted
by the great majority of surgeons; the minority, who find they are
handicapped by wearing gloves as a routine measure, are obliged to do so
when operating in infective cases or dressing infected wounds, and in
making rectal and vaginal examinations.

the gloves may be sterilised by steam, and are then put on dry, or by
boiling, in which case they are put on wet. the gauntlet of the glove
should overlap and confine the end of the sleeve of the sterilised
overall, and the gloved hands are rinsed in lotion before and at
frequent intervals during the operation. the hands are sterilised before
putting on the gloves, preferably by a method which dehydrates the skin.
cotton gloves may be worn by the surgeon when tying ligatures, or
between operations, and by the anaesthetist during operations on the
head, neck, and chest.

the first step in the disinfection of the hands is the mechanical
removal of gross surface dirt and loose epithelium by soap, a stream of
running water as hot as can be borne, and a loofah or nail-brush, that
has been previously sterilised by heat. the nails should be cut down
till there is no sulcus between the nail edge and the pulp of the finger
in which organisms may lodge. they are next washed for three minutes in
methylated spirit to dehydrate the skin, and then for two or three
minutes in 70 per cent. sublimate or biniodide alcohol (1 in 1000).
finally, the hands are rubbed with dry sterilised gauze.

#preparation of the skin of the patient.#--in the purification of the
skin of the patient before operation, reliance is to be placed chiefly
in the mechanical removal of dirt and grease by the same means as are
taken for the cleansing of the surgeon's hands. hair-covered parts
should be shaved. the skin is then dehydrated by washing with methylated
spirit, followed by 70 per cent. sublimate or biniodide alcohol (1 in
1000). this is done some hours before the operation, and the part is
then covered with pads of dry sterilised gauze or a sterilised towel.
immediately before the operation the skin is again purified in the same
way.

the _iodine method_ of disinfecting the skin introduced by grossich is
simple, and equally efficient. the day before operation the skin, after
being washed with soap and water, is shaved, dehydrated by means of
methylated spirit, and then painted with a 5 per cent. solution of
iodine in rectified spirit. the painting with iodine is repeated just
before the operation commences, and again after it is completed. the
final application is omitted in the case of children. in emergency
operations the skin is shaved dry and dehydrated with spirit, after
which the iodine is applied as described above. the staining of the skin
is an advantage, as it enables the operator to recognise the area that
has been prepared.

if any acne pustules or infected sinuses are present, they should be
destroyed or purified by means of the thermo-cautery or pure carbolic
acid, after the patient is anaesthetised.

#appliances used at operation.#--_instruments_ that are not damaged by
heat must be boiled in a fish-kettle or other suitable steriliser for
fifteen minutes in a 1 per cent. solution of cresol or washing soda.
just before the operation begins they are removed in the tray of the
steriliser and placed on a sterilised towel within reach of the surgeon
or his assistant. knives and instruments that are liable to be damaged
by heat should be purified by being soaked in pure cresol for a few
minutes, or in 1 in 20 carbolic for at least an hour.

_pads of gauze_ sterilised by compressed circulating steam have almost
entirely superseded marine sponges for operative purposes. to avoid the
risk of leaving swabs in the peritoneal cavity, large square pads of
gauze, to one corner of which a piece of strong tape about a foot long
is securely stitched, should be employed. they should be removed from
the caskets in which they are sterilised by means of sterilised forceps,
and handed direct to the surgeon. the assistant who attends to the swabs
should wear sterilised gloves.

_ligatures and sutures._--to avoid the risk of implanting infective
matter in a wound by means of the materials used for ligatures and
sutures, great care must be taken in their preparation.

_catgut._--the following methods of preparing catgut have proved
satisfactory: (1) the gut is soaked in juniper oil for at least a month;
the juniper oil is then removed by ether and alcohol, and the gut
preserved in 1 in 1000 solution of corrosive sublimate in alcohol
(kocher). (2) the gut is placed in a brass receiver and boiled for
three-quarters of an hour in a solution consisting of 85 per cent.
absolute alcohol, 10 per cent. water, and 5 per cent. carbolic acid, and
is then stored in 90 per cent. alcohol. (3) cladius recommends that the
catgut, just as it is bought from the dealers, be loosely rolled on a
spool, and then immersed in a solution of--iodine, 1 part; iodide of
potassium, 1 part; distilled water, 100 parts. at the end of eight days
it is ready for use. moschcowitz has found that the tensile strength of
catgut so prepared is increased if it is kept dry in a sterile vessel,
instead of being left indefinitely in the iodine solution. if
salkindsohn's formula is used--tincture of iodine, 1 part; proof spirit,
15 parts--the gut can be kept permanently in the solution without
becoming brittle. to avoid contamination from the hands, catgut should
be removed from the bottle with aseptic forceps and passed direct to the
surgeon. any portion unused should be thrown away.

_silk_ is prepared by being soaked for twelve hours in ether, for other
twelve in alcohol, and then boiled for ten minutes in 1 in 1000
sublimate solution. it is then wound on spools with purified hands
protected by sterilised gloves, and kept in absolute alcohol. before an
operation the silk is again boiled for ten minutes in the same solution,
and is used directly from this (kocher). linen thread is sterilised in
the same way as silk.

fishing-gut and silver wire, as well as the needles, should be boiled
along with the instruments. horse-hair and fishing-gut may be sterilised
by prolonged immersion in 1 in 20 carbolic, or in the iodine solutions
employed to sterilise catgut.

the field of operation is surrounded by sterilised towels, clipped to
the edges of the wound, and securely fixed in position so that no
contamination may take place from the surroundings.

the surgeon and his assistants, including the anaesthetist, wear
overalls sterilised by steam. to avoid the risk of infection from dust,
scurf, or drops of perspiration falling from the head, the surgeon and
his assistants may wear sterilised cotton caps. to obviate the risk of
infection taking place by drops of saliva projected from the mouth in
talking or coughing in the vicinity of a wound, a simple mask may be
worn.

the risk of infection from the _air_ is now known to be very small, so
long as there is no excess of floating dust. all sweeping, dusting, and
disturbing of curtains, blinds, or furniture must therefore be avoided
before or during an operation.

it has been shown that the presence of spectators increases the number
of organisms in the atmosphere. in teaching clinics, therefore, the risk
from air infection is greater than in private practice.

to facilitate primary union, all haemorrhage should be arrested, and the
accumulation of fluid in the wound prevented. when much oozing is
anticipated, a glass or rubber drainage-tube is inserted through a small
opening specially made for the purpose. in aseptic wounds the tube may
be removed in from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, and where it is
important to avoid a scar, the opening should be closed with a michel's
clip; in infected wounds the tube must remain as long as the discharge
continues.

the fascia and skin should be brought into accurate apposition by
sutures. if any cavity exists in the deeper part of the wound it should
be obliterated by buried sutures, or by so adjusting the dressing as to
bring its walls into apposition.

if these precautions have been successful, the wound will heal under the
original dressing, which need not be interfered with for from seven to
ten days, according to the nature of the case.

#dressings.#--_gauze_, sterilised by heat, is almost universally
employed for the dressing of wounds. _double cyanide gauze_ may be used
in such regions as the neck, axilla, or groin, where complete
sterilisation of the skin is difficult to attain, and where it is
desirable to leave the dressing undisturbed for ten days or more.
_iodoform_ or _bismuth gauze_ is of special value for the packing of
wounds treated by the open method.

one variety or another of _wool_, rendered absorbent by the extraction
of its fat, and sterilised by heat, forms a part of almost every
surgical dressing, and various antiseptic agents may be added to it. of
these, corrosive sublimate is the most generally used. wood-wool
dressings are more highly and more uniformly absorbent than cotton
wools. as evaporation takes place through wool dressings, the discharge
becomes dried, and so forms an unfavourable medium for bacterial growth.

pads of _sphagnum moss_, sterilised by heat, are highly absorbent, and
being economical are used when there is much discharge, and in cases
where a leakage of urine has to be soaked up.

#means adopted to combat infection.#--as has already been indicated, the
same antiseptic precautions are to be taken in dealing with infected as
with aseptic wounds.

in _recent injuries_ such as result from railway or machinery accidents,
with bruising and crushing of the tissues and grinding of gross dirt
into the wounds, the scissors must be freely used to remove the tissues
that have been devitalised or impregnated with foreign material.
hair-covered parts should be shaved and the surrounding skin painted
with iodine. crushed and contaminated portions of bone should be
chiselled away. opinions differ as to the benefit derived from washing
such wounds with chemical antiseptics, which are liable to devitalise
the tissues with which they come in contact, and so render them less
able to resist the action of any organisms that may remain in them. all
are agreed, however, that free washing with normal salt solution is
useful in mechanically cleansing the injured parts. peroxide of hydrogen
sprayed over such wounds is also beneficial in virtue of its oxidising
properties. efficient drainage must be provided, and stitches should be
used sparingly, if at all.

the best way in which to treat such wounds is by the _open method_. this
consists in packing the wound with iodoform or bismuth gauze, which is
left in position as long as it adheres to the raw surface. the packing
may be renewed at intervals until the wound is filled by granulations;
or, in the course of a few days when it becomes evident that the
infection has been overcome, _secondary_ sutures may be introduced and
the edges drawn together, provision being made at the ends for further
packing or for drainage-tubes.

if earth or street dirt has entered the wound, the surface may with
advantage be painted over with pure carbolic acid, as virulent
organisms, such as those of tetanus or spreading gangrene, are liable to
be present. prophylactic injection of tetanus antitoxin may be
indicated.

constitutional effects of injuries


syncope--shock--collapse--fat embolism--traumatic asphyxia--delirium
    in surgical patients: _delirium in general_; _delirium tremens_;
    _traumatic delirium_.


syncope, shock, and collapse

syncope, shock, and collapse are clinical conditions which, although
depending on different causes, bear a superficial resemblance to one
another.

#syncope or fainting.#--syncope is the result of a suddenly produced
anaemia of the brain from temporary weakening or arrest of the heart's
action. in surgical practice, this condition is usually observed in
nervous persons who have been subjected to pain, as in the reduction of
a dislocation or the incision of a whitlow; or in those who have rapidly
lost a considerable quantity of blood. it may also follow the sudden
withdrawal of fluid from a large cavity, as in tapping an abdomen for
ascites, or withdrawing fluid from the pleural cavity. syncope sometimes
occurs also during the administration of a general anaesthetic,
especially if there is a tendency to sickness and the patient is not
completely under. during an operation the onset of syncope is often
recognised by the cessation of oozing from the divided vessels before
the general symptoms become manifest.

_clinical features._--when a person is about to faint he feels giddy,
has surging sounds in his ears, and haziness of vision; he yawns,
becomes pale and sick, and a free flow of saliva takes place into the
mouth. the pupils dilate; the pulse becomes small and almost
imperceptible; the respirations shallow and hurried; consciousness
gradually fades away, and he falls in a heap on the floor.

sometimes vomiting ensues before the patient completely loses
consciousness, and the muscular exertion entailed may ward off the
actual faint. this is frequently seen in threatened syncopal attacks
during chloroform administration.

recovery begins in a few seconds, the patient sighing or gasping, or, it
may be, vomiting; the strength of the pulse gradually increases, and
consciousness slowly returns. in some cases, however, syncope is fatal.

_treatment._--the head should at once be lowered--in imitation of
nature's method--to encourage the flow of blood to the brain, the
patient, if necessary, being held up by the heels. all tight clothing,
especially round the neck or chest, must be loosened. the heart may be
stimulated reflexly by dashing cold water over the face or chest, or by
rubbing the face vigorously with a rough towel. the application of
volatile substances, such as ammonia or smelling-salts, to the nose; the
administration by the mouth of sal-volatile, whisky or brandy, and the
intra-muscular injection of ether, are the most speedily efficacious
remedies. in severe cases the application of hot cloths over the heart,
or of the faradic current over the line of the phrenic nerve, just above
the clavicle, may be called for.

#surgical shock.#--the condition known as surgical shock may be looked
upon as a state of profound exhaustion of the mechanism that exists in
the body for the transformation of energy. this mechanism consists of
(1) the _brain_, which, through certain special centres, regulates all
vital activity; (2) the _adrenal glands_, the secretion of
which--adrenalin--acting as a stimulant of the sympathetic system, so
controls the tone of the blood vessels as to maintain efficient
oxidation of the tissues; and (3) _the liver_, which stores and delivers
glycogen as it is required by the muscles, and in addition, deals with
the by-products of metabolism.

crile and his co-workers have shown that in surgical shock histological
changes occur in the cells of the brain, the adrenals, and the liver,
and that these are identical, whatever be the cause that leads to the
exhaustion of the energy-transforming mechanism. these changes vary in
degree, and range from slight alterations in the structure of the
protoplasm to complete disorganisation of the cell elements.

the influences which contribute to bring about this form of exhaustion
that we call shock are varied, and include such emotional states as
fear, anxiety, or worry, physical injury and toxic infection, and the
effects of these factors are augmented by anything that tends to lower
the vitality, such as loss of blood, exposure, insufficient food, loss
of sleep or antecedent illness.

any one or any combination of these influences may cause shock, but the
most potent, and the one which most concerns the surgeon, is physical
injury, _e.g._, a severe accident or an operation (_traumatic shock_).
this is usually associated with some emotional disturbance, such as fear
or anxiety (_emotional shock_), or with haemorrhage; and may be followed
by septic infection (_toxic shock_).

the exaggerated afferent impulses reaching the brain as a result of
trauma, inhibit the action of the nuclei in the region of the fourth
ventricle and cerebellum which maintain the muscular tone, with the
result that the muscular tone is diminished and there is a marked fall
in the arterial blood pressure. the capillaries dilate--the blood
stagnating in them and giving off its oxygen and transuding its fluid
elements into the tissues--with the result that an insufficient quantity
of oxygenated blood reaches the heart to enable it to maintain an
efficient circulation. as the sarco-lactic acid liberated in the muscles
is not oxygenated a condition of acidosis ensues.

the more highly the injured part is endowed with sensory nerves the more
marked is the shock; a crush of the hand, for example, is attended with
a more intense degree of shock than a correspondingly severe crush of
the foot; and injuries of such specially innervated parts as the testis,
the urethra, the face, or the spinal cord, are associated with severe
degrees, as are also those of parts innervated from the sympathetic
system, such as the abdominal or thoracic viscera. it is to be borne in
mind that a state of general anaesthesia does not prevent injurious
impulses reaching the brain and causing shock during an operation. if
the main nerves of the part are "blocked" by injection of a local
anaesthetic, however, the central nervous system is protected from these
impulses.

while the aged frequently manifest but few signs of shock, they have a
correspondingly feeble power of recovery; and while many young children
suffer little, even after severe operations, others with much less cause
succumb to shock.

when the injured person's mind is absorbed with other matters than his
own condition,--as, for example, during the heat of a battle or in the
excitement of a railway accident or a conflagration,--even severe
injuries may be unattended by pain or shock at the time, although when
the period of excitement is over, the severity of the shock is all the
greater. the same thing is observed in persons injured while under the
influence of alcohol.

_clinical features._--the patient is in a state of prostration. he is
roused from his condition of indifference with difficulty, but answers
questions intelligently, if only in a whisper. the face is pale, beads
of sweat stand out on the brow, the features are drawn, the eyes
sunken, and the cheeks hollow. the lips and ears are pallid; the skin of
the body of a greyish colour, cold, and clammy. the pulse is rapid,
fluttering, and often all but imperceptible at the wrist; the
respiration is irregular, shallow, and sighing; and the temperature may
fall to 96 o f. or even lower. the mouth is parched, and the patient
complains of thirst. there is little sensibility to pain.

except in very severe cases, shock tends towards recovery within a few
hours, the _reaction_, as it is called, being often ushered in by
vomiting. the colour improves; the pulse becomes full and bounding; the
respiration deeper and more regular; the temperature rises to 100 o f. or
higher; and the patient begins to take notice of his surroundings. the
condition of neurasthenia which sometimes follows an operation may be
associated with the degenerative changes in nerve cells described by
crile.

in certain cases the symptoms of traumatic shock blend with those
resulting from toxin absorption, and it is difficult to estimate the
relative importance of the two factors in the causation of the
condition. the conditions formerly known as "delayed shock" and
"prostration with excitement" are now generally recognised to be due to
toxaemia.

_question of operating during shock._--most authorities agree that
operations should only be undertaken during profound shock when they are
imperatively demanded for the arrest of haemorrhage, the prevention of
infection of serous cavities, or for the relief of pain which is
producing or intensifying the condition.

_prevention of operation shock._--in the preparation of a patient for
operation, drastic purgation and prolonged fasting must be avoided, and
about half an hour before a severe operation a pint of saline solution
should be slowly introduced into the rectum; this is repeated, if
necessary, during the operation, and at its conclusion. the
operating-room must be warm--not less than 70 o f.--and the patient
should be wrapped in cotton wool and blankets, and surrounded by
hot-bottles. all lotions used must be warm (100 o f.); and the operation
should be completed as speedily and as bloodlessly as possible. the
element of fear may to some extent be eliminated by the preliminary
administration of such drugs as scopolamin or morphin, and with a view
to preventing the passage of exciting afferent impulses, crile advocates
"blocking" of the nerves by the injection of a 1 per cent. solution of
novocaine into their substance on the proximal side of the field of
operation. to prevent after-pain in abdominal wounds he recommends
injecting the edges with quinine and urea hydrochlorate before suturing,
the resulting anaesthesia lasting for twenty-four to forty-eight hours.
to these preventive measures the term _anoci-association_ has been
applied. in selecting an anaesthetic, it may be borne in mind that
chloroform lowers the blood pressure more than ether does, and that with
spinal anaesthesia there is no lowering of the blood pressure.

_treatment._--a patient suffering from shock should be placed in the
recumbent position, with the foot of the bed raised to facilitate the
return circulation in the large veins, and so to increase the flow of
blood to the brain. his bed should be placed near a large fire, and the
patient himself surrounded by cotton wool and blankets and hot-bottles.
if he has lost much blood, the limbs should be wrapped in cotton wool
and firmly bandaged from below upwards, to conserve as much of the
circulating blood as possible in the trunk and head. if the shock is
moderate in degree, as soon as the patient has been put to bed, about a
pint of saline solution should be introduced into the rectum, and 10 to
15 minims of adrenalin chloride (1 in 1000) may with advantage be added
to the fluid. the injection should be repeated every two hours until the
circulation is sufficiently restored. in severe cases, especially when
associated with haemorrhage, transfusion of whole blood from a compatible
donor, is the most efficient means (_op. surg._, p. 37). cardiac
stimulants such as strychnin, digitalin, or strophanthin are
contra-indicated in shock, as they merely exhaust the already impaired
vaso-motor centre.

artificial respiration may be useful in tiding a patient over the
critical period of shock, especially at the end of a severe operation.

failing this, the introduction of saline solution at a temperature of
about 105 o f. into a vein or into the subcutaneous tissue is useful
where much blood has been lost (p. 276). two or three pints may be
injected into a vein, or smaller quantities under the skin.

thirst is best met by giving small quantities of warm water by the
mouth, or by the introduction of saline solution into the rectum. ice
only relieves thirst for a short time, and as it is liable to induce
flatulence should be avoided, especially in abdominal cases. dryness of
the tongue may be relieved by swabbing the mouth with a mixture of
glycerine and lemon juice.

if severe pain calls for the use of morphin, 1/120th grain of atropin
should be added, or heroin alone may be given in doses of 1/24th to
1/12th grain.

#collapse# is a clinical condition which comes on more insidiously than
shock, and which does not attain its maximum degree of severity for
several hours. it is met with in the course of severe illnesses,
especially such as are associated with the loss of large quantities of
fluid from the body--for example, by severe diarrhoea, notably in asiatic
cholera; by persistent vomiting; or by profuse sweating, as in some
cases of heat-stroke. severe degrees of collapse follow sudden and
profuse loss of blood.

collapse often follows upon shock--for example, in intestinal
perforations, or after abdominal operations complicated by peritonitis,
especially if there is vomiting, as in cases of obstruction high up in
the intestine. the symptoms of collapse are aggravated if toxin
absorption is superadded to the loss of fluid.

the _clinical features_ of this condition are practically the same as
those of shock; and it is treated on the same lines.

fat embolism.--after various injuries and operations, but
especially such as implicate the marrow of long bones--for example,
comminuted fractures, osteotomies, resections of joints, or the forcible
correction of deformities--fluid fat may enter the circulation in
variable quantity. in the vast majority of cases no ill effects follow,
but when the quantity is large or when the absorption is long continued
certain symptoms ensue, either immediately, or more frequently not for
two or three days. these are mostly referable to the lungs and brain.

in the lung the fat collects in the minute blood vessels and produces
venous congestion and oedema, and sometimes pneumonia. dyspnoea, with
cyanosis, a persistent cough and frothy or blood-stained sputum, a
feeble pulse and low temperature, are the chief symptoms.

when the fat lodges in the capillaries of the brain, the pulse becomes
small, rapid, and irregular, delirium followed by coma ensues, and the
condition is usually rapidly fatal.

fat is usually to be detected in the urine, even in mild cases.

the _treatment_ consists in tiding the patient over the acute stage of
his illness, until the fat is eliminated from the blood vessels.

traumatic asphyxia or traumatic cyanosis.--this term has been
applied to a condition which results when the thorax is so forcibly
compressed that respiration is mechanically arrested for several
minutes. it has occurred from being crushed in a struggling crowd, or
under a fall of masonry, and in machinery accidents. when the patient is
released, the face and the neck as low down as the level of the
clavicles present an intense coloration, varying from deep purple to
blue-black. the affected area is sharply defined, and on close
inspection the appearance is found to be due to the presence of
countless minute reddish-blue or black spots, with small areas or
streaks of normal skin between them. the punctate nature of the
coloration is best recognised towards the periphery of the affected
area--at the junction of the brow with the hairy scalp, and where the
dark patch meets the normal skin of the chest (beach and cobb). pressure
over the skin does not cause the colour to disappear as in ordinary
cyanosis. it has been shown by wright of boston, that the coloration is
due to stasis from mechanical over-distension of the veins and
capillaries; actual extravasation into the tissues is exceptional. the
sharply defined distribution of the coloration is attributed to the
absence of functionating valves in the veins of the head and neck, so
that when the increased intra-thoracic pressure is transmitted to these
veins they become engorged. under the conjunctivae there are
extravasations of bright red blood; and sublingual haematoma has been
observed (beatson).

the discoloration begins to fade within a few hours, and after the
second or third day it disappears, without showing any of the chromatic
changes which characterise a bruise. the sub-conjunctival ecchymosis,
however, persists for several weeks and disappears like other
extravasations. apart from combating the shock, or dealing with
concomitant injuries, no treatment is called for.


delirium in surgical patients

delirium is a temporary disturbance of mind which occurs in the course
of certain diseases, and sometimes after injuries or operations. it may
be associated with any of the acute pyogenic infections; with
erysipelas, especially when it affects the head or face; or with chronic
infective diseases of the urinary organs. in the various forms of
meningitis also, and in some cases of injury to the head, it is common;
and it is sometimes met with after severe haemorrhage, and in cases of
poisoning by such drugs as iodoform, cocain, or alcohol. delirium may
also, of course, be a symptom of insanity.

often there is merely incoherent muttering regarding past incidents or
occupations, or about absent friends; or the condition may assume the
form of excitement, of dementia, or of melancholia; and the symptoms are
usually worst at night.

#delirium tremens# is seen in persons addicted to alcohol, who, as the
result of accident or operation, are suddenly compelled to lie in bed.
although oftenest met with in habitual drunkards or chronic tipplers, it
is by no means uncommon in moderate drinkers, and has even been seen in
children.

_clinical features._--the delirium, which has been aptly described as
being of a "busy" character, usually manifests itself within a few days
of the patient being laid up. for two or three days he refuses food, is
depressed, suspicious, sleepless and restless, demanding to be allowed
up. then he begins to mutter incoherently, to pull off the bedclothes,
and to attempt to get out of bed. there is general muscular tremor, most
marked in the tongue, the lips, and the hands. the patient imagines that
he sees all sorts of horrible beings around him, and is sometimes
greatly distressed because of rats, mice, beetles, or snakes, which he
fancies are crawling over him. the pulse is soft, rapid, and
compressible; the temperature is only moderately raised (100 o-101 o f.),
and as a rule there is profuse sweating. the digestion is markedly
impaired, and there is often vomiting. patients in this condition are
peculiarly insensitive to pain, and may even walk about with a fractured
leg without apparent discomfort.

in most cases the symptoms begin to pass off in three or four days; the
patient sleeps, the hallucinations and tremors cease, and he gradually
recovers. in other cases the temperature rises, the pulse becomes rapid,
and death results from exhaustion.

the main indication in _treatment_ is to secure sleep, and this is done
by the administration of bromides, chloral, or paraldehyde, or of one or
other of the drugs of which sulphonal, trional, and veronal are
examples. heroin in doses of from 1/24th to 1/12th grain is often of
service. morphin must be used with great caution. in some cases hyoscin
(1/200 grain) injected hypodermically is found efficacious when all
other means have failed, but this drug must be used with great
discrimination. the patient must be encouraged to take plenty of easily
digested fluid food, supplemented, if necessary, by nutrient enemata and
saline infusions.

in the early stage a brisk mercurial purge is often of value. alcohol
should be withheld, unless failing of the pulse strongly indicates its
use, and then it should be given along with the food.

a delirious patient must be constantly watched by a trained attendant or
other competent person, lest he get out of bed and do harm to himself or
others. mechanical restraint is often necessary, but must be avoided if
possible, as it is apt to increase the excitement and exhaust the
patient. on account of the extreme restlessness, there is often great
difficulty in carrying out the proper treatment of the primary surgical
condition, and considerable modifications in splints and other
appliances are often rendered necessary.

a form of delirium, sometimes spoken of as #traumatic delirium#, may
follow on severe injuries or operations in persons of neurotic
temperament, or in those whose nervous system is exhausted by overwork.
it is met with apart from alcoholic intemperance. this form of delirium
seems to be specially prone to ensue on operations on the face, the
thyreoid gland, or the genito-urinary organs. the symptoms appear in
from two to five days after the operation, and take the form of
restlessness, sleeplessness, low incoherent muttering, and picking at
the bedclothes. it is not necessarily attended by fever or by muscular
tremors. the patient may show hysterical symptoms. this condition is
probably to be regarded as a form of insanity, as it is liable to merge
into mania or melancholia.

the _treatment_ is carried out on the same lines as that of delirium
tremens.

    _methods of treatment_--aneurysms of individual arteries.

#surgical anatomy.#--an _artery_ has three coats: an internal coat--the
_tunica intima_--made up of a single layer of endothelial cells lining
the lumen; outside of this a layer of delicate connective tissue; and
still farther out a dense tissue composed of longitudinally arranged
elastic fibres--the internal elastic lamina. the tunica intima is easily
ruptured. the middle coat, or _tunica media_, consists of non-striped
muscular fibres, arranged for the most part concentrically round the
vessel. in this coat also there is a considerable proportion of elastic
tissue, especially in the larger vessels. the thickness of the vessel
wall depends chiefly on the development of the muscular coat. the
external coat, or _tunica externa_, is composed of fibrous tissue,
containing, especially in vessels of medium calibre, some yellow elastic
fibres in its deeper layers.

in most parts of the body the arteries lie in a sheath of connective
tissue, from which fine fibrous processes pass to the tunica externa.
the connection, however, is not a close one, and the artery when divided
transversely is capable of retracting for a considerable distance within
its sheath. in some of the larger arteries the sheath assumes the form
of a definite membrane.

the arteries are nourished by small vessels--the _vasa vasorum_--which
ramify chiefly in the outer coat. they are also well supplied with
nerves, which regulate the size of the lumen by inducing contraction or
relaxation of the muscular coat.

the _veins_ are constructed on the same general plan as the arteries,
the individual coats, however, being thinner. the inner coat is less
easily ruptured, and the middle coat contains a smaller proportion of
muscular tissue. in one important point veins differ structurally from
arteries--namely, in being provided with valves which prevent reflux of
the blood. these valves are composed of semilunar folds of the tunica
intima strengthened by an addition of connective tissue. each valve
usually consists of two semilunar flaps attached to opposite sides of
the vessel wall, each flap having a small sinus on its cardiac side.
the distension of these sinuses with blood closes the valve and
prevents regurgitation. valves are absent from the superior and inferior
venae cavae, the portal vein and its tributaries, the hepatic, renal,
uterine, and spermatic veins, and from the veins in the lower part of
the rectum. they are ill-developed or absent also in the iliac and
common femoral veins--a fact which has an important bearing on the
production of varix in the veins of the lower extremity.

the wall of _capillaries_ consists of a single layer of endothelial
cells.


haemorrhage

various terms are employed in relation to haemorrhage, according to its
seat, its origin, the time at which it occurs, and other circumstances.

the term _external haemorrhage_ is employed when the blood escapes on the
surface; when the bleeding takes place into the tissues or into a cavity
it is spoken of as _internal_. the blood may infiltrate the connective
tissue, constituting an _extravasation_ of blood; or it may collect in a
space or cavity and form a _haematoma_.

the coughing up of blood from the lungs is known as _haemoptysis_;
vomiting of blood from the stomach, as _haematemesis_; the passage of
black-coloured stools due to the presence of blood altered by digestion,
as _melaena_; and the passage of bloody urine, as _haematuria_.

haemorrhage is known as arterial, venous, or capillary, according to the
nature of the vessel from which it takes place.

in _arterial_ haemorrhage the blood is bright red in colour, and escapes
from the cardiac end of the divided vessel in pulsating jets
synchronously with the systole of the heart. in vascular parts--for
example the face--both ends of a divided artery bleed freely. the blood
flowing from an artery may be dark in colour if the respiration is
impeded. when the heart's action is weak and the blood tension low the
flow may appear to be continuous and not in jets. the blood from a
divided artery at the bottom of a deep wound, escapes on the surface in
a steady flow.

_venous_ bleeding is not pulsatile, but occurs in a continuous stream,
which, although both ends of the vessel may bleed, is more copious from
the distal end. the blood is dark red under ordinary conditions, but may
be purplish, or even black, if the respiration is interfered with. when
one of the large veins in the neck is wounded, the effects of
respiration produce a rise and fall in the stream which may resemble
arterial pulsation.

in _capillary_ haemorrhage, red blood escapes from numerous points on the
surface of the wound in a steady ooze. this form of bleeding is serious
in those who are the subjects of haemophilia.


injuries of arteries

the following description of the injuries of arteries refers to the
larger, named trunks. the injuries of smaller, unnamed vessels are
included in the consideration of wounds and contusions.

#contusion.#--an artery may be contused by a blow or crush, or by the
oblique impact of a bullet. the bruising of the vessel wall, especially
if it is diseased, may result in the formation of a thrombus which
occludes the lumen temporarily or even permanently, and in rare cases
may lead to gangrene of the limb beyond.

#subcutaneous rupture.#--an artery may be ruptured subcutaneously by a
blow or crush, or by a displaced fragment of bone. this injury has been
produced also during attempts to reduce dislocations, especially those
of old standing at the shoulder. it is most liable to occur when the
vessels are diseased. the rupture may be incomplete or complete.

_incomplete subcutaneous rupture._--in the majority of cases the rupture
is incomplete--the inner and middle coats being torn, while the outer
remains intact. the middle coat contracts and retracts, and the
internal, because of its elasticity, curls up in the interior of the
vessel, forming a valvular obstruction to the blood-flow. in most cases
this results in the formation of a thrombus which occludes the vessel.
in some cases the blood-pressure gradually distends the injured segment
of the vessel wall and leads to the formation of an aneurysm.

the pulsation in the vessels beyond the seat of rupture is arrested--for
a time at least--owing to the occlusion of the vessel, and the limb
becomes cold and powerless. the pulsation seldom returns within five or
six weeks of the injury, if indeed it is not permanently arrested, but,
as a rule, a collateral circulation is rapidly established, sufficient
to nourish the parts beyond. if the pulsation returns within a week of
the injury, the presumption is that the occlusion was due to pressure
from without--for example, by haemorrhage into the sheath or the pressure
of a fragment of bone.

_complete subcutaneous rupture._--when the rupture is complete, all the
coats of the vessel are torn and the blood escapes into the surrounding
tissues. if the original injury is attended with much shock, the
bleeding may not take place until the period of reaction. rupture of the
popliteal artery in association with fracture of the femur, or of the
axillary or brachial artery with fracture of the humerus or dislocation
of the shoulder, are familiar examples of this injury.

like incomplete rupture, this lesion is accompanied by loss of pulsation
and power, and by coldness of the limb beyond; a tense and excessively
painful swelling rapidly appears in the region of the injury, and, where
the cellular tissue is loose, may attain a considerable size. the
pressure of the effused blood occludes the veins and leads to congestion
and oedema of the limb beyond. the interference with the circulation, and
the damage to the tissues, may be so great that gangrene ensues.

_treatment._--when an artery has been contused or ruptured, the limb
must be placed in the most favourable condition for restoration of the
circulation. the skin is disinfected and the limb wrapped in cotton wool
to conserve its heat, and elevated to such an extent as to promote the
venous return without at the same time interfering with the inflow of
blood. a careful watch must be kept on the state of nutrition of the
limb, lest gangrene occurs.

if no complications supervene, the swelling subsides, and recovery may
be complete in six or eight weeks. if the extravasation is great and the
skin threatens to give way, or if the vitality of the limb is seriously
endangered, it is advisable to expose the injured vessel, and, after
clearing away the clots, to attempt to suture the rent in the artery,
or, if torn across, to join the ends after paring the bruised edges. if
this is impracticable, a ligature is applied above and below the
rupture. if gangrene ensues, amputation must be performed.

these descriptions apply to the larger arteries of the extremities. a
good illustration of subcutaneous rupture of the arteries of the head is
afforded by the tearing of the middle meningeal artery caused by the
application of blunt violence to the skull; and of the arteries of the
trunk--caused by the tearing of the renal artery in rupture of the
kidney.

#open wounds of arteries--laceration.#--laceration of large arteries is
a common complication of machinery and railway accidents. the violence
being usually of a tearing, twisting, or crushing nature, such injuries
are seldom associated with much haemorrhage, as torn or crushed vessels
quickly become occluded by contraction and retraction of their coats and
by the formation of a clot. a whole limb even may be avulsed from the
body with comparatively little loss of blood. the risk in such cases is
secondary haemorrhage resulting from pyogenic infection.

the _treatment_ is that applicable to all wounds, with, in addition, the
ligation of the lacerated vessels.

#punctured wounds# of blood vessels may result from stabs, or they may
be accidentally inflicted in the course of an operation.

the division of the coats of the vessel being incomplete, the natural
haemostasis that results from curling up of the intima and contraction of
the media, fails to take place, and bleeding goes on into the
surrounding tissues, and externally. if the sheath of the vessel is not
widely damaged, the gradually increasing tension of the extravasated
blood retained within it may ultimately arrest the haemorrhage. a clot
then forms between the lips of the wound in the vessel wall and projects
for a short distance into the lumen, without, however, materially
interfering with the flow through the vessel. the organisation of this
clot results in the healing of the wound in the vessel wall.

in other cases the blood escapes beyond the sheath and collects in the
surrounding tissues, and a traumatic aneurysm results. secondary
haemorrhage may occur if the wound becomes infected.

the _treatment_ consists in enlarging the external wound to permit of
the damaged vessel being ligated above and below the puncture. in some
cases it may be possible to suture the opening in the vessel wall. when
circumstances prevent these measures being taken, the bleeding may be
arrested by making firm pressure over the wound with a pad; but this
procedure is liable to be followed by the formation of an aneurysm.

_minute puncture of arteries_ such as frequently occur in the hypodermic
administration of drugs and in the use of exploring needles, are not
attended with any escape of blood, chiefly because of the elastic recoil
of the arterial wall; a tiny thrombus of platelets and thrombus forms at
the point where the intima is punctured.

#incised wounds.#--we here refer only to such incised wounds as partly
divide the vessel wall.

longitudinal wounds show little tendency to gape, and are therefore not
attended with much bleeding. they usually heal rapidly, but, like
punctured wounds, are liable to be followed by the formation of an
aneurysm.

when, however, the incision in the vessel wall is oblique or transverse,
the retraction of the muscular coat causes the opening to gape, with the
result that there is haemorrhage, which, even in comparatively small
arteries, may be so profuse as to prove dangerous. when the associated
wound in the soft parts is valvular the haemorrhage is arrested and an
aneurysm may develop.

when a large arterial trunk, such as the external iliac, the femoral,
the common carotid, the brachial, or the popliteal, has been partly
divided, for example, in the course of an operation, the opening should
be closed with sutures--_arteriorrhaphy_. the circulation being
controlled by a tourniquet, or the artery itself occluded by a clamp,
fine silk or catgut stitches are passed through the outer and middle
coats after the method of lembert, a fine, round needle being employed.
the sheath of the vessel or an adjacent fascia should be stitched
over the line of suture in the vessel wall. if infection be excluded,
there is little risk of thrombosis or secondary haemorrhage; and even if
thrombosis should develop at the point of suture, the artery is
obstructed gradually, and the establishment of a collateral circulation
takes place better than after ligation. in the case of smaller trunks,
or when suture is impracticable, the artery should be tied above and
below the opening, and divided between the ligatures.

#gunshot wounds of blood vessels.#--in the majority of cases injuries of
large vessels are associated with an external wound; the profusion of
the bleeding indicates the size of the damaged vessel, and the colour of
the blood and the nature of the flow denote whether an artery or a vein
is implicated.

when an artery is wounded a firm _haematoma_ may form, with an expansile
pulsation and a palpable thrill--whether such a haematoma remains
circumscribed or becomes diffuse depends upon the density or laxity of
the tissues around it. in course of time a _traumatic arterial aneurysm_
may develop from such a haematoma.

when an artery and its companion vein are injured simultaneously an
_arterio-venous aneurysm_ (p. 310) may develop. this frequently takes
place without the formation of a haematoma as the arterial blood finds
its way into the vein and so does not escape into the tissues. even if a
haematoma forms it seldom assumes a great size. in time a swelling is
recognised, with a palpable thrill and a systolic bruit, loudest at the
level of the communication and accompanied by a continuous venous hum.

if leakage occurs into the tissues, the extravasated blood may occlude
the vein by pressure, and the symptoms of arterial aneurysm replace
those of the arterio-venous form, the systolic bruit persisting, while
the venous hum disappears.

_gangrene_ may ensue if the blood supply is seriously interfered with,
or the signs of _ischaemia_ may develop; the muscles lose their
elasticity, become hard and paralysed, and anaesthesia of the "glove" or
"stocking" type, with other alterations of sensation ensue. apart from
ischaemia, _reflex paralysis_ of motion and sensation of a transient kind
may follow injury of a large vessel.

_treatment_ is carried out on the same lines as for similar injuries due
to other causes.


injuries of veins

veins are subject to the same forms of injury as arteries, and the
results are alike in both, such variations as occur being dependent
partly on the difference in their anatomical structure, and partly on
the conditions of the circulation through them.

#subcutaneous rupture# of veins occur most frequently in association
with fractures and in the reduction of dislocations. the veins most
commonly ruptured are the popliteal, the axillary, the femoral, and the
subclavian. on account of the smaller amount of elastic and muscular
tissue in the wall of a vein, the contraction and retraction of its
walls are less than in an artery, and so bleeding may continue for a
longer period. on the other hand, owing to the lower blood-pressure the
outflow goes on more slowly, and the gradually increasing pressure
produced by the extravasated blood is usually sufficient to arrest the
haemorrhage before it becomes serious. as an aid in diagnosing the source
of the bleeding, it should be remembered that the rupture of a vein does
not affect the pulsation in the limb beyond. the risks are practically
the same as when an artery is ruptured, excepting that of aneurysm, and
the treatment is carried out on the same lines, but it is seldom
necessary to operate for the purpose of applying a ligature to the
injured vein.

#wounds# of veins--punctured and incised--frequently occur in the course
of operations; for example, in the removal of tumours or diseased glands
from the neck, the axilla, or the groin. they are also met with as a
result of accidental stabs and of suicidal or homicidal injuries. the
haemorrhage from a large vein so damaged is usually profuse, but it is
more readily controlled by external pressure than that from an artery.
when a vein is merely punctured, the bleeding may be arrested by
pressure with a pad of gauze, or by a lateral ligature--that is, picking
up the margins of the rent in the wall and securing them with a
ligature without occluding the lumen. in the large veins, such as the
internal jugular, the femoral, or the axillary, it is usually possible
to suture the opening in the wall. this does not necessarily result in
thrombosis in the vessel, or in obliteration of its lumen.

when an _artery and vein are simultaneously wounded_, the features
peculiar to each are present in greater or less degree. in the limbs
gangrene may ensue, especially if the wound is infected. punctured and
gun-shot wounds implicating both artery and vein are liable to be
followed by the development of arterio-venous aneurysm.

#entrance of air into veins--air embolism.#--this serious, though
fortunately rare, accident is apt to occur in the course of operations
in the region of the thorax, neck, or axilla, if a large vein is opened
and fails to collapse on account of the rigidity of its walls, its
incorporation in a dense fascia, or from traction being made upon it. if
the wound in a vein is thus held open, the negative pressure during
inspiration sucks air into the right side of the heart. this is
accompanied by a hissing or gurgling sound, and with the next expiration
some frothy blood escapes from the wound. the patient instantly becomes
pale, the pupils dilate, respiration becomes laboured, and although the
heart may continue to beat forcibly, the peripheral pulse is weak, and
may even be imperceptible. on auscultating the heart, a churning sound
may be heard. death may result in a few minutes; or the heart may slowly
regain its power and recovery take place.

_prevention._--in operations in the "dangerous area"--as the region of
the root of the neck is called in this connection--care must be taken
not to cut or divide any vein before it has been secured by forceps, and
to apply ligatures securely and at once. deep wounds in this region
should be kept filled with normal salt solution. immediately a cut is
recognised in a vein, a finger should be placed over the vessel on the
cardiac side of the wound, and kept there until the opening is secured.

_treatment._--little can be done after the air has actually entered the
vein beyond endeavouring to maintain the heart's action by hypodermic
injections of ether or strychnin and the application of mustard or hot
cloths over the chest. the head at the same time should be lowered to
prevent syncope. attempts to withdraw the air by suction, and the
employment of artificial respiration, have proved futile, and are, by
some, considered dangerous. in a desperate case massage of the heart
might be tried.


the natural arrest of haemorrhage and the repair of blood
vessels

#primary haemorrhage.#--the term primary haemorrhage is applied to the
bleeding which follows immediately on the wounding of a blood vessel.
the natural process by which such haemorrhage is arrested varies with the
character of the wound in the vessel and may be modified by accidental
circumstances.

(a) _repair of completely divided artery._--when an artery is
_completely_ divided, the circular fibres of the muscular coat contract,
so that the lumen of the cut ends is diminished, and at the same time
each segment retracts within its sheath in virtue of the recoil of the
elastic elements in its walls, the tunica intima curls up in the
interior of the vessel, and the tunica externa collapses over the cut
ends. the blood that escapes from the injured vessel fills the
interstices of the tissues, and, coagulating, forms a clot which
temporarily arrests the bleeding. that part of the clot which lies
between the divided ends of the vessel and in the cellular tissue
outside, is known as the _external clot_, while the portion which
projects into the lumen of the vessel is known as the _internal clot_,
and it usually extends as far as the nearest collateral branch. these
processes constitute what is known as the _temporary arrest of
haemorrhage_, which, it will be observed, is effected by the contraction
and retraction of the divided artery and by clotting.

the _permanent arrest_ takes place by the transformation of the clot
into scar tissue. the internal clot plays the most important part in the
process; it becomes invaded by leucocytes and proliferating endothelial
and connective-tissue cells, and new blood vessels permeate the mass,
which is thus converted into granulation tissue. this is ultimately
replaced by fibrous tissue, which permanently occludes the end of the
vessel. concurrently and by the same process the external clot is
converted into scar tissue.

if a divided artery is _ligated at its cut end_, the tension of the
ligature is usually sufficient to rupture the inner and middle coats,
which curl up within the lumen, the outer coat alone being held in the
grasp of the ligature. an internal clot forms and, becoming organised,
permanently occludes the vessel as above described. the ligature and the
small portion of vessel beyond it are subsequently absorbed.

in course of time the collateral branches of the vessel above and below
the level of section enlarge and their inter-communication becomes more
free, so that even when large trunks have been divided the vascular
supply of the parts beyond may be completely restored. this is known as
the development of the _collateral circulation_.

_imperfect collateral circulation._--while the development of the
collateral circulation after the ligation or obstruction from other
cause of a main arterial trunk may be sufficient to prevent gangrene of
the limb, it may be insufficient for its adequate nourishment; it may be
cold, bluish in colour, and there may be necrosis of the skin over bony
points; this is notably the case in the lower extremity after ligation
of the femoral or popliteal artery, when patches of skin may die over
the prominence of the heel, the balls of the toes, the projecting base
of the fifth metatarsal and the external malleolus.

if, during the period of reaction, the blood-pressure rises

considerably, the occluding clot at the divided end of the vessel may be
washed away or the ligature displaced, permitting of fresh bleeding
taking place--_reactionary_ or _intermediary haemorrhage_ (p. 272).

in the event of the wound becoming infected with pyogenic organisms, the
occluding blood-clot or the young fibrous tissue may become
disintegrated in the suppurative process, and the bleeding start
afresh--_secondary haemorrhage_ (p. 273).

(b) if an artery is only _partly cut across_, the divided fibres of
the tunica muscularis contract and those of the tunica externa retract,
with the result that a more or less circular hole is formed in the wall
of the vessel, from which free bleeding takes place, as the conditions
are unfavourable for the formation of an occluding clot. even if a clot
does form, when the blood-pressure rises it is readily displaced,
leading to reactionary haemorrhage. should the wound become infected,
secondary haemorrhage is specially liable to occur. a further risk
attends this form of injury, in that the intra-vascular tension may in
time lead to gradual stretching of the scar tissue which closes the gap
in the vessel wall, with the result that a localised dilatation or
diverticulum forms, constituting a _traumatic aneurysm_.

(c) when the injury merely takes the form of a _puncture_ or _small
incision_ a blood-clot forms between the edges, becomes organised, and
is converted into cicatricial tissue which seals the aperture. such
wounds may also be followed by reactionary or secondary haemorrhage, or
later by the formation of a traumatic aneurysm.

_conditions which influence the natural arrest of haemorrhage._--the
natural arrest of bleeding is favoured by tearing or crushing of the
vessel walls, owing to the contraction and retraction of the coats and
the tendency of blood to coagulate when in contact with damaged tissue.
hence the primary haemorrhage following lacerated wounds is seldom
copious. the occurrence of syncope or of profound shock also helps to
stop bleeding by reducing the force of the heart's action.

on the other hand, there are conditions which retard the natural arrest.
when, for example, a vessel is only partly divided, the contraction and
retraction of the muscular coat, instead of diminishing the calibre of
the artery, causes the wound in the vessel to gape; by completing the
division of the vessel under these circumstances the bleeding can often
be arrested. in certain situations, also, the arteries are so intimately
connected with their sheaths, that when cut across they were unable to
retract and contract--for example, in the scalp, in the penis, and in
bones--and copious bleeding may take place from comparatively small
vessels. this inability of the vessels to contract and retract is met
with also in inflamed and oedematous parts and in scar tissue. arteries
divided in the substance of a muscle also sometimes bleed unduly. any
increase in the force of the heart's action, such as may result from
exertion, excitement, or over-stimulation, also interferes with the
natural arrest. lastly, in bleeders, there are conditions which
interfere with the natural arrest of haemorrhage.

#repair of a vessel ligated in its continuity.#--when a ligature is
applied to an artery it should be pulled sufficiently tight to occlude
the lumen without causing rupture of its coats. it often happens,
however, that the compression causes rupture of the inner and middle
coats, so that only the outer coat remains in the grasp of the ligature.
while this weakens the wall of the vessel, it has the advantage of
hastening coagulation, by bringing the blood into contact with damaged
tissue. whether the inner and middle coats are ruptured or not, blood
coagulates both above and below the ligature, the proximal clot being
longer and broader than that on the distal side. in small arteries these
clots extend as far as the nearest collateral branch, but in the larger
trunks their length varies. the permanent occlusion of those portions of
the vessel occupied by clot is brought about by the formation of
granulation tissue, and its replacement by cicatricial tissue, so that
the occluded segment of the vessel is represented by a fibrous cord. in
this process the coagulum only plays a passive role by forming a
scaffolding on which the granulation tissue is built up. the ligature
surrounding the vessel, and the elements of the clot, are ultimately
absorbed.

#repair of veins.#--the process of repair in veins is the same as that
in arteries, but the thrombosed area may become canalised and the
circulation through the vessel be re-established.


haemorrhage in surgical operations

the management of the haemorrhage which accompanies an operation includes
(a) preventive measures, and (b) the arrest of the bleeding.

#prevention of haemorrhage.#--whenever possible, haemorrhage should be
controlled by _digital compression_ of the main artery supplying the
limb rather than by a tourniquet. if efficiently applied compression
reduces the immediate loss of blood to a minimum, and the bleeding from
small vessels that follows the removal of the tourniquet is avoided.
further, the pressure of a tourniquet has been shown to be a material
factor in producing shock.

in selecting a point at which to apply digital compression, it is
essential that the vessel should be lying over a bone which will furnish
the necessary resistance. the common carotid, for example, is pressed
backward and medially against the transverse process (carotid tubercle)
of the sixth cervical vertebra; the temporal against the temporal
process (zygoma) in front of the ear; and the facial against the
mandible at the anterior edge of the masseter.

in the upper extremity, the subclavian is pressed against the first rib
by making pressure downwards and backwards in the hollow above the
clavicle; the axillary and brachial by pressing against the shaft of the
humerus.

in the lower extremity, the femoral is controlled by pressing in a
direction backward and slightly upward against the brim of the pelvis,
midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac
spine.

the abdominal aorta may be compressed against the bodies of the lumbar
vertebrae opposite the umbilicus, if the spine is arched well forwards
over a pillow or sand-bag, or by the method suggested by macewen, in
which the patient's spine is arched forwards by allowing the lower
extremities and pelvis to hang over the end of the table, while the
assistant, standing on a stool, applies his closed fist over the
abdominal aorta and compresses it against the vertebral column.
momburg recommends an elastic cord wound round the body between the
iliac crest and the lower border of the ribs, but this procedure has
caused serious damage to the intestine.

when digital compression is not available, the most convenient and
certain means of preventing haemorrhage--say in an amputation--is by the
use of some form of _tourniquet_, such as the elastic tube of esmarch or
of foulis, or an elastic bandage, or the screw tourniquet of petit.
before applying any of these it is advisable to empty the limb of blood.
this is best done after the manner suggested by lister: the limb is held
vertical for three or four minutes; the veins are thus emptied by
gravitation, and they collapse, and as a physiological result of this
the arteries reflexly contract, so that the quantity of blood entering
the limb is reduced to a minimum. with the limb still elevated the
tourniquet is firmly applied, a part being selected where the vessel can
be pressed directly against a bone, and where there is no risk of
exerting injurious pressure on the nerve-trunks. the tourniquet should
be applied over several layers of gauze or lint to protect the skin, and
the first turn of the tourniquet must be rapidly and tightly applied to
arrest completely the arterial flow, otherwise the veins only are
obstructed and the limb becomes congested. in the lower extremity the
best place to apply a tourniquet is the middle third of the thigh; in
the upper extremity, in the middle of the arm. a tourniquet should never
be applied tighter or left on longer than is absolutely necessary.

the screw tourniquet of petit is to be preferred when it is desired to
intermit the flow through the main artery as in operations for aneurysm.

when a tourniquet cannot conveniently be applied, or when its presence
interferes with the carrying out of the operation--as, for example, in
amputations at the hip or shoulder--the haemorrhage may be controlled by
preliminary ligation of the main artery above the seat of operation--for
instance, the external iliac or the subclavian. for such contingencies
also the steel skewers used by spence and wyeth, or a special clamp or
forceps, such as that suggested by lynn thomas, may be employed. in the
case of vessels which it is undesirable to occlude permanently, such as
the common carotid, the temporary application of a ligature or clamp is
useful.

#arrest of haemorrhage.#--_ligature._--this is the best means of securing
the larger vessels. the divided vessel having been caught with forceps
as near to its cut end as possible, a ligature of catgut or silk is tied
round it. when there is difficulty in applying a ligature securely, for
example in a dense tissue like the scalp or periosteum, or in a friable
tissue like the thyreoid gland or the mesentery, a stitch should be
passed so as to surround the bleeding vessel a short distance from its
end, in this way ensuring a better hold and preventing the ligature from
slipping.

if the haemorrhage is from a partly divided vessel, this should be
completely cut across to enable its walls to contract and retract, and
to facilitate the application of forceps and ligatures.

_torsion._--this method is seldom employed except for comparatively
small vessels, but it is applicable to even the largest arteries. in
employing torsion, the end of the vessel is caught with forceps, and the
terminal portion twisted round several times. the object is to tear the
inner and middle coats so that they curl up inside the lumen, while the
outer fibrous coat is twisted into a cord which occludes the end of the
vessel.

_forci-pressure._--bleeding from the smallest arteries and from
arterioles can usually be arrested by firmly squeezing them for a few
minutes with artery forceps. it is usually found that on the removal of
the forceps at the end of an operation no further haemorrhage takes
place. by the use of specially strong clamps, such as the angiotribes of
doyen, large trunks may be occluded by pressure.

_cautery._--the actual cautery or paquelin's thermo-cautery is seldom
employed to arrest haemorrhage, but is frequently useful in preventing
it, as, for example, in the removal of piles, or in opening the bowel in
colostomy. it is used at a dull-red heat, which sears the divided ends
of the vessel and so occludes the lumen. a bright-red or a white heat
cuts the vessel across without occluding it. the separation of the
slough produced by the charring of the tissues is sometimes attended
with secondary bleeding.

_haemostatics_ or _styptics_.--the local application of haemostatics is
seldom to be recommended. in the treatment of epistaxis or bleeding from
the nose, of haemorrhage from the socket of a tooth, and sometimes from
ulcerating or granulating surfaces, however, they may be useful. all
clots must be removed and the drug applied directly to the bleeding
surface. adrenalin and turpentine are the most useful drugs for this
purpose.

haemorrhage from bone, for example the skull, may be arrested by means of
horsley's aseptic plastic wax. to stop persistent oozing from soft
tissues, horsley successfully applied a portion of living vascular
tissue, such as a fragment of muscle, which readily adheres to the
oozing surface and yields elements that cause coagulation of the blood
by thrombo-kinetic processes. when examined after two or three days the
muscle has been found to be closely adherent and undergoing
organisation.

#arrest of accidental haemorrhage.#--the most efficient means of
temporarily controlling haemorrhage is by pressure applied with the
finger, or with a pad of gauze, directly over the bleeding point. while
this is maintained an assistant makes digital pressure, or applies a
tourniquet, over the main vessel of the limb on the proximal side of the
bleeding point. a useful _emergency tourniquet_ may be improvised by
folding a large handkerchief _en cravatte_, with a cork or piece of wood
in the fold to act as a pad. the handkerchief is applied round the
limb, with the pad over the main artery, and the ends knotted on the
lateral aspect of the limb. with a strong piece of wood the handkerchief
is wound up like a spanish windlass, until sufficient pressure is
exerted to arrest the bleeding.

when haemorrhage is taking place from a number of small vessels, its
arrest may be effected by elevation of the bleeding part, particularly
if it is a limb. by this means the force of the circulation is
diminished and the formation of coagula favoured. similarly, in wounds
of the hand or forearm, or of the foot or leg, bleeding may be arrested
by placing a pad in the flexure and acutely flexing the limb at the
elbow or knee respectively.

#reactionary haemorrhage.#--reactionary or intermediary haemorrhage
is really a recurrence of primary bleeding. as the name indicates, it
occurs during the period of reaction--that is, within the first twelve
hours after an operation or injury. it may be due to the increase in the
blood-pressure that accompanies reaction displacing clots which have
formed in the vessels, or causing vessels to bleed which did not bleed
during the operation; to the slipping of a ligature; or to the giving
way of a grossly damaged portion of the vessel wall. in the scrotum, the
relaxation of the dartos during the first few hours after operation
occasionally leads to reactionary haemorrhage.

as a rule, reactionary haemorrhage takes place from small vessels as a
result of the displacement of occluding clots, and in many cases the
haemorrhage stops when the bandages and soaked dressings are removed. if
not, it is usually sufficient to remove the clots and apply firm
pressure, and in the case of a limb to elevate it. should the haemorrhage
recur, the wound must be reopened, and ligatures applied to the bleeding
vessels. douching the wound with hot sterilised water (about 110 o f.),
and plugging it tightly with gauze, are often successful in arresting
capillary oozing. when the bleeding is more copious, it is usually due
to a ligature having slipped from a large vessel such as the external
jugular vein after operations in the neck, and the wound must be opened
up and the vessel again secured. the internal administration of heroin
or morphin, by keeping the patient quiet, may prove useful in preventing
the recurrence of haemorrhage.

#secondary haemorrhage.#--the term secondary haemorrhage refers to
bleeding that is delayed in its onset and is due to pyogenic infection
of the tissues around an artery. the septic process causes softening and
erosion of the wall of the artery so that it gives way under the
pressure of the contained blood. the leakage may occur in drops, or as a
rush of blood, according to the extent of the erosion, the size of the
artery concerned, and the relations of the erosion to the surrounding
tissues. when met with as a complication of a wound there is an
interval--usually a week to ten days--between the receipt of the wound
and the first haemorrhage, this time being required for the extension of
the septic process to the wall of the artery and the consequent erosion
of its coats. when secondary haemorrhage occurs apart from a wound, there
is a similar septic process attacking the wall of the artery from the
outside; for example in sloughing sore-throat, the separation of a
slough may implicate the wall of an artery and be followed by serious
and it may be fatal haemorrhage. the mechanical pressure of a fragment of
bone or of a rubber drainage tube upon the vessel may aid the septic
process in causing erosion of the artery. in pre-listerian days, the
silk ligature around the artery likewise favoured the changes that lead
to secondary haemorrhage, and the interesting observation was often made,
that when the collateral circulation was well established, the leakage
occurred on the _distal_ side of the ligature. while it may happen that
the initial haemorrhage is rapidly fatal, as for example when the
external carotid or one of its branches suddenly gives way, it is quite
common to have one, two or more _warning haemorrhages_ before the leakage
on a large scale, which is rapidly fatal.

the _appearances of the wound_ in cases complicated by secondary
haemorrhage are only characteristic in so far that while obviously
infected, there is an absence of all reaction; instead of frankly
suppurating, there is little or no discharge and the surrounding
cellular tissue and the limb beyond are oedematous and pit on pressure.

the _general symptoms_ of septic poisoning in cases of secondary
haemorrhage vary widely in severity: they may be so slight that the
general health is scarcely affected and the convalescence from an
operation, for example, may be apparently normal except that the wound
does not heal satisfactorily. for example, a patient may be recovering
from an operation such as the removal of an epithelioma of the mouth,
pharynx or larynx and the associated lymph glands in the neck, and be
able to be up and going about his room, when, suddenly, without warning
and without obvious cause, a rush of blood occurs from the mouth or the
incompletely healed wound in the neck, causing death within a few
minutes.

on the other hand, the toxaemia may be of a profound type associated with
marked pallor and progressive failure of strength, which, of itself,
even when the danger from haemorrhage has been overcome, may have a fatal
termination. the _prognosis_ therefore in cases of secondary haemorrhage
can never be other than uncertain and unfavourable; the danger from loss
of blood _per se_ is less when the artery concerned is amenable to
control by surgical measures.

_treatment._--the treatment of secondary haemorrhage includes the use of
local measures to arrest the bleeding, the employment of general
measures to counteract the accompanying toxaemia, and when the loss of
blood has been considerable, the treatment of the bloodless state.

_local measures to arrest the haemorrhage._--the occurrence of even
slight haemorrhages from a septic wound in the vicinity of a large blood
vessel is to be taken seriously; it is usually necessary to _open up the
wound_, clear out the clots and infected tissues with a sharp spoon,
disinfect the walls of the cavity with eusol or hydrogen peroxide, and
_pack_ it carefully but not too tightly with gauze impregnated with some
antiseptic, such as "bipp," so that, if the bleeding does not recur, it
may be left undisturbed for several days. the packing should if possible
be brought into actual contact with the leaking point in the vessel, and
so arranged as to make pressure on the artery above the erosion. the
dressings and bandage are then applied, with the limb in the attitude
that will diminish the force of the stream through the main artery, for
example, flexion at the elbow in haemorrhage from the deep palmar arch.
other measures for combating the local sepsis, such as the irrigation
method of carrel, may be considered.

if the wound involves one of the extremities, it may be useful; and it
imparts confidence to the nurse, and, it may be, to the patient, if a
petit's tourniquet is loosely applied above the wound, which the nurse
is instructed to tighten up in the event of bleeding taking place.

_ligation of the artery._--if the haemorrhage recurs in spite of packing
the wound, or if it is serious from the outset and likely to be critical
if repeated, ligation of the artery itself or of the trunk from which it
springs, at a selected spot higher up, should be considered. this is
most often indicated in wounds of the extremities.

as examples of proximal ligation for secondary haemorrhage may be cited
ligation of the hypogastric artery for haemorrhage in the buttock, of the
common iliac for haemorrhage in the thigh, of the brachial in the upper
arm for haemorrhage from the deep palmar arch, and of the posterior
tibial behind the medial malleolus for haemorrhage from the sole of the
foot.

_amputation_ is the last resource, and should be decided upon if the
haemorrhage recurs after proximal ligation, or if this has been followed
by gangrene of the limb; it should also be considered if the nature of
the wound and the virulence of the sepsis would of themselves justify
removal of the limb. every surgeon can recall cases in which a timely
amputation has been the means of saving life.

the _counteraction of the toxaemia_ and the _treatment of the bloodless
state_, are carried out on the usual lines.

#haemorrhage of toxic origin.#--mention must also be made of haemorrhages
which depend upon infective or toxic conditions and in which no gross
lesion of the vessels can be discovered. the bleeding occurs as an
oozing, which may be comparatively slight and unimportant, or by its
persistence may become serious. it takes place into the superficial
layers of the skin, from mucous membranes, and into the substance of
such organs as the pancreas. haemorrhage from the stomach and intestine,
attended with a brown or black discoloration of the vomit and of the
stools, is one of the best known examples: it is not uncommonly met with
in infective conditions originating in the appendix, intestine,
gall-bladder, and other abdominal organs. haemorrhage from the mucous
membrane of the stomach after abdominal operations--apparently also due
to toxic causes and not to the operation--gives rise to the so-called
_post-operative haematemesis_.

#constitutional effects of haemorrhage.#--the severity of the symptoms
resulting from haemorrhage depends as much on the rapidity with which the
bleeding takes place as on the amount of blood lost. the sudden loss of
a large quantity, whether from an open wound or into a serous
cavity--for example, after rupture of the liver or spleen--is attended
with marked pallor of the surface of the body and coldness of the skin,
especially of the face, feet, and hands. the skin is moist with a cold,
clammy sweat, and beads of perspiration stand out on the forehead. the
pulse becomes feeble, soft, and rapid, and the patient is dull and
listless, and complains of extreme thirst. the temperature is usually
sub-normal; and the respiration rapid, shallow, and sighing in
character. abnormal visual sensations, in the form of flashes of light
or spots before the eyes; and rushing, buzzing, or ringing sounds in the
ears, are often complained of.

in extreme cases, phenomena which have been aptly described as those of
"air-hunger" ensue. on account of the small quantity of blood
circulating through the body, and the diminished haemoglobin content of
the blood, the tissues are imperfectly oxygenated, and the patient
becomes extremely restless, gasping for breath, constantly throwing
about his arms and baring his chest in the vain attempt to breath more
freely. faintness and giddiness are marked features. the diminished
supply of oxygen to the brain and to the muscles produces muscular
twitchings, and sometimes convulsions. finally the pupils dilate, the
sphincters relax, and death ensues.

young children stand the loss of blood badly, but they quickly recover,
as the regeneration of blood takes place rapidly. in old people also,
and especially when they are fat, the loss of blood is badly borne, and
the ill effects last longer. women, on the whole, stand loss of blood
better than men, and in them the blood is more rapidly re-formed. a few
hours after a severe haemorrhage there is usually a leucocytosis of from
15,000 to 30,000.

#treatment of the bloodless state.#--the patient should be placed in a
warm, well-ventilated room, and the foot of the bed elevated. cardiac
stimulants, such as strychnin or alcohol, must be judiciously
administered, over-stimulation being avoided. the inhalation of oxygen
has been found useful in relieving the urgent symptoms of dyspnoea.

the blood may be emptied from the limbs into the vessels of the trunk,
where it is more needed, by holding them vertically in the air for a few
minutes, and then applying a firm elastic bandage over a layer of cotton
wool, from the periphery towards the trunk.

_introduction of fluids into the circulation._--the most valuable
measure for maintaining the circulation, however, is by transfusion of
blood (_op. surg._, p. 37). if this is not immediately available the
introduction of from one to three pints of physiological salt
solution (a teaspoonful of common salt to a pint of water) into a vein,
or a 6 per cent. solution of gum acacia, is a useful expedient. the
solution is sterilised by boiling, and cooled to a temperature of about
105 o f. the addition of 5 to 10 minims of adrenalin solution (1 in 1000)
is advantageous in raising the blood-pressure (_op. surg._, p. 565).

when the intra-venous method is not available, one or two pints of
saline solution with adrenalin should be slowly introduced into the
rectum, by means of a long rubber tube and a filler. satisfactory,
although less rapidly obtained results follow the introduction of saline
solution into the cellular tissue--for example, under the mamma, into
the axilla, or under the skin of the back.

if the patient can retain fluids taken by the mouth--such as hot coffee,
barley water, or soda water--these should be freely given, unless the
injury necessitates operative treatment under a general anaesthetic.

transfusion of blood is most valuable as _a preliminary to operation_ in
patients who are bloodless as a result of haemorrhage from gastric and
duodenal ulcers, and in bleeders.


haemophilia

the term haemophilia is applied to an inherited disease which renders the
patient liable to serious haemorrhage from even the most trivial
injuries; and the subjects of it are popularly known as "bleeders."

the cause of the disease and its true nature are as yet unknown. there
is no proof of any structural defect in the blood vessels, and beyond
the fact that there is a diminution in the number of blood-plates, it
has not been demonstrated that there is any alteration in the
composition of the blood.

the affection is in a marked degree hereditary, all the branches of an
affected family being liable to suffer. its mode of transmission to
individuals, moreover, is characteristic: the male members of the stock
alone suffer from the affection in its typical form, while the tendency
is transmitted through the female line. thus the daughters of a father
who is a bleeder, whilst they do not themselves suffer from the disease,
transmit the tendency to their male offspring. the sons, on the other
hand, neither suffer themselves nor transmit the disease to their
children (fig. 64). the female members of a haemophilic stock are often
very prolific, and there is usually a predominance of daughters in their
families.

 ** the patients observed by the authors. the dotted line shows the
    transmission of the disease to our patients through four
    generations.


the disease is met with in boys who are otherwise healthy, and usually
manifests itself during the first few years of life. in rare instances
profuse haemorrhage takes place when the umbilical cord separates. as a
rule the first evidence is the occurrence of long-continued and
uncontrollable bleeding from a comparatively slight injury, such as the
scratch of a pin, the extraction of a tooth, or after the operation of
circumcision. the blood oozes slowly from the capillaries; at first it
appears normal, but after flowing for some days, or it may be weeks, it
becomes pale, thin, and watery, and shows less and less tendency to
coagulate.

female members of haemophilia families sometimes show a tendency to
excessive haemorrhage, but they seldom manifest the characteristic
features met with in the male members.

sometimes the haemorrhage takes place apparently spontaneously from the
gums, the nasal or the intestinal mucous membrane. in other cases the
bleeding occurs into the cellular tissue under the skin or mucous
membrane, producing large areas of ecchymosis and discoloration. one of
the commonest manifestations of the disease is the occurrence of
haemorrhage into the cavities of the large joints, especially the knee,
elbow, or hip. the patient suffers repeatedly from such haemorrhages, the
determining injury being often so slight as to have passed unobserved.

there is evidence that the tendency to bleed is greater at certain times
than at others--in some cases showing almost a cyclical
character--although nothing is known as to the cause of the variation.

after a severe haemorrhage into the cellular tissue or into a joint, the
patient becomes pale and anaemic, the temperature may rise to 102 o or
103 o f., the pulse become small and rapid, and haemic murmurs are
sometimes developed over the heart and large arteries. the swelling is
tense, fluctuating, and hot, and there is considerable pain and
tenderness.

in exceptional cases, blisters form over the seat of the effusion, or
the skin may even slough, and the clinical features may therefore come
to simulate closely those of an acute suppurative condition. when the
skin sloughs, an ulcer is formed with altered blood-clot in its floor
like that seen in scurvy, and there is a remarkable absence of any
attempt at healing.

the acute symptoms gradually subside, and the blood is slowly absorbed,
the discoloration of the skin passing through the same series of changes
as occur after an ordinary bruise. the patients seldom manifest the
symptoms of the bloodless state, and the blood is rapidly regenerated.

the _diagnosis_ is easy if the patient or his friends are aware of the
family tendency to haemorrhage and inform the doctor of it, but they are
often sensitive and reticent regarding the fact, and it may only be
elicited after close investigation. from the history it is usually easy
to exclude scurvy and purpura. repeated haemorrhages into a joint may
result in appearances which closely simulate those of tuberculous
disease. recent haemorrhages into the cellular tissue often present
clinical features closely resembling those of acute cellulitis or
osteomyelitis. a careful examination, however, may reveal ecchymoses on
other parts of the body which give a clue to the nature of the
condition, and may prevent the disastrous consequences that may follow
incision.

these patients usually succumb sooner or later to haemorrhage, although
they often survive several severe attacks. after middle life the
tendency to bleed appears to diminish.

_treatment._--as a rule the ordinary means of arresting haemorrhage are
of little avail. from among the numerous means suggested, the following
may be mentioned: the application to the bleeding point of gauze soaked
in a 1 in 1000 solution of adrenalin; prolonged inhalation of oxygen;
freezing the part with a spray of ethyl-chloride; one or more
subcutaneous injections of gelatin--5 ounces of a 2 1/2 per cent.
solution of white gelatin in normal salt solution being injected at a
temperature of about 100 o f.; the injection of pituitary extract. the
application of a pad of gauze soaked in the blood of a normal person
sometimes arrests the bleeding.

to prevent bleeding in haemophilics, intra-venous or subcutaneous
injections of fresh blood serum, taken from the human subject, the
sheep, the dog, or the horse, have proved useful. if fresh serum is not
available, anti-diphtheritic or anti-tetanic serum or trade
preparations, such as hemoplastin, may be employed. we have removed the
appendix and amputated through the thigh in haemophilic subjects without
excessive loss of blood after a course of fresh sheep's serum given by
the mouth over a period of several weeks.

the chloride and lactate of calcium, and extract of thymus gland have
been employed to increase the coagulability of the blood. the patient
should drink large quantities of milk, which also increases the
coagulability of the blood. monro has observed remarkable results from
the hypodermic injection of emetin hydrochloride in  1/2-grain doses.


thrombosis and embolism

the processes known as thrombosis and embolism are so intimately
associated with the diseases of blood vessels that it is convenient to
define these terms in the first instance.

#thrombosis.#--the term _thrombus_ is applied to a clot of blood formed
in the interior of the heart or of a blood vessel, and the process by
which such a clot forms is known as _thrombosis_. it would appear that
slowing or stagnation of the blood-stream, and interference with the
integrity of the lining membrane of the vessel wall, are the most
important factors determining the formation of the clot. alterations in
the blood itself, such as occur, for example, in certain toxaemias, also
favour coagulation. when the thrombus is formed slowly, it consists of
white blood cells with a small proportion of fibrin, and, being
deposited in successive layers, has a distinctly laminated appearance on
section. it is known as a _white thrombus_ or laminated clot, and is
often met with in the sac of an aneurysm (fig. 72). when rapidly formed
in a vessel in which the blood is almost stagnant--as, for example, in a
pouched varicose vein--the blood coagulates _en masse_, and the clot
consists of all the elements of the blood, constituting a _red thrombus_
(fig. 66). sometimes the thrombus is _mixed_--a red thrombus being
deposited on a white one, it may be in alternate layers.

when aseptic, a thrombus may become detached and be carried off in the
blood-stream as an embolus; it may become organised; or it may
degenerate and undergo calcification. occasionally a small thrombus
situated behind a valve in a varicose vein or in the terminal end of a
dilated vein--for example in a pile--undergoes calcification, and is
then spoken of as a _phlebolith_; it gives a shadow with the x-rays.

when infected with pyogenic bacteria, the thrombus becomes converted
into pus and a localised abscess forms; or portions of the thrombus may
be carried as emboli in the circulation to distant parts, where they
give rise to secondary foci of suppuration--pyaemic abscesses.

#embolism.#--the term _embolus_ is applied to any body carried along in
the circulation and ultimately becoming impacted in a blood vessel. this
occurrence is known as _embolism_. the commonest forms of embolus are
portions of thrombi or of fibrinous formations on the valves of the
heart, the latter being usually infected with micro-organisms.

embolism plays an important part in determining one form of gangrene, as
has already been described. infective emboli are the direct cause of the
secondary abscesses that occur in pyaemia; and they are sometimes
responsible for the formation of aneurysm.

portions of malignant tumours also may form emboli, and their impaction
in the vessels may lead to the development of secondary growths in
distant parts of the body.

fat and air embolism have already been referred to.


arteritis

_pyogenic._--non-suppurative inflammation of the coats of an artery may
so soften the wall of the vessel as to lead to aneurysmal dilatation. it
is not uncommon in children, and explains the occurrence of aneurysm in
young subjects.

when suppuration occurs, the vessel wall becomes disintegrated and gives
way, leading to secondary haemorrhage. if the vessel ruptures into an
abscess cavity, dangerous bleeding may occur when the abscess bursts or
is opened.

_syphilitic._--the inflammation associated with syphilis results in
thickening of the tunica intima, whereby the lumen of the vessel becomes
narrowed, or even obliterated--_endarteritis obliterans_. the middle
coat usually escapes, but the tunica externa is generally thickened.
these changes cause serious interference with the nutrition of the parts
supplied by the affected arteries. in large trunks, by diminishing the
elasticity of the vessel wall, they are liable to lead to the formation
of aneurysm.

changes in the arterial walls closely resembling those of syphilitic
arteritis are sometimes met with in _tuberculous_ lesions.

#arterio-sclerosis# or #chronic arteritis#.--these terms are applied to
certain changes which result in narrowing of the lumen and loss of
elasticity in the arteries. the condition may affect the whole vascular
system or may be confined to particular areas. in the smaller arteries
there is more or less uniform thickening of the tunica intima from
proliferation of the endothelium and increase in the connective tissue
in the elastic lamina--a form of obliterative endarteritis. the
narrowing of the vessels may be sufficient to determine gangrene in the
extremities. in course of time, particularly in the larger arteries,
this new tissue undergoes degeneration, at first of a fatty nature, but
progressing in the direction of calcification, and this is followed by
the deposit of lime salts in the young connective tissue and the
formation of calcareous plates or rings over a considerable area of the
vessel wall. to this stage in the process the term _atheroma_ is
applied. the endothelium over these plates often disappears, leaving
them exposed to the blood-stream.

changes of a similar kind sometimes occur in the middle coat, the lime
salts being deposited among the muscle fibres in concentric rings.

the primary cause of arterio-sclerosis is not definitely known, but its
almost constant occurrence, to a greater or less degree, in the aged
suggests that it is of the nature of a senile degeneration. it is
favoured by anything which throws excessive strain on the vessel walls,
such as heavy muscular work; by chronic alcoholism and syphilis; or by
such general diseases as tend to raise the blood-pressure--for example,
chronic bright's disease or gout. it occurs with greater frequency and
with greater severity in men than in women.

atheromatous degeneration is most common in the large arterial trunks,
and the changes are most marked at the arch of the aorta, opposite the
flexures of joints, at the mouths of large branches, and at parts where
the vessel lies in contact with bone. the presence of diseased patches
in the wall of an artery diminishes its elasticity and favours
aneurysmal dilatation. such a vessel also is liable to be ruptured by
external violence and so give rise to traumatic aneurysm. thrombosis is
liable to occur when calcareous plates are exposed in the lumen of the
vessel by destruction of the endothelium, and this predisposes to
embolism. arterio-sclerosis also interferes with the natural arrest of
haemorrhage, and by rendering the vessels brittle, makes it difficult to
secure them by ligature. in advanced cases the accessible arteries--such
as the radial, the temporal or the femoral--may be felt as firm,
tortuous cords, which are sometimes so hard that they have been aptly
compared to "pipe-stems." the pulse is smaller and less compressible
than normal, and the vessel moves bodily with each pulsation. it must be
borne in mind, however, that the condition of the radial artery may fail
to afford a clue to that of the larger arteries. calcified arteries are
readily identified in skiagrams (fig. 65).

[illustration: fig. 65.--radiogram showing calcareous degeneration
(atheroma) of arteries.]

we have met with a chronic form of arterial degeneration in elderly
women, affecting especially the great vessels at the root of the neck,
in which the artery is remarkably attenuated and dilated, and so friable
that the wall readily tears when seized with an artery-forceps,
rendering ligation of the vessel in the ordinary way well-nigh
impossible. matas suggests infolding the wall of the vessel with
interrupted sutures that do not pierce the intima, and wrapping it
round with a strip of peritoneum or omentum.

the most serious form of arterial _thrombosis_ is that met with _in the
abdominal aorta_, which is attended with violent pains in the lower
limbs, rapidly followed by paralysis and arrest of the circulation.


thrombo-phlebitis and thrombosis in veins

#thrombosis# is more common in veins than in arteries, because slowing
of the blood-stream and irritation of the endothelium of the vessel wall
are, owing to the conditions of the venous circulation, more readily
induced in veins.

venous thrombosis may occur from purely mechanical causes--as, for
example, when the wall of a vein is incised, or the vessel included in a
ligature, or when it is bruised or crushed by a fragment of a broken
bone or by a bandage too tightly applied. under these conditions
thrombosis is essentially a reparative process, and has already been
considered in relation to the repair of blood vessels.

in other cases thrombosis is associated with certain constitutional
diseases--gout, for example; the endothelium of the veins undergoing
changes--possibly the result of irritation by abnormal constituents in
the blood--which favour the formation of thrombi.

under these various conditions the formation of a thrombus is not
necessarily associated with the action of bacteria, although in any
of them this additional factor may be present.

the most common cause of venous thrombosis, however, is inflammation of
the wall of the vein--phlebitis.

#phlebitis.#--various forms of phlebitis are met with, but for practical
purposes they may be divided into two groups--one in which there is a
tendency to the formation of a thrombus; the other in which the
infective element predominates.

in surgical patients, the _thrombotic form_ is almost invariably met
with in the lower extremity, and usually occurs in those who are
debilitated and anaemic, and who are confined to bed for prolonged
periods--for example, during the treatment of fractures of the leg or
pelvis, or after such operations as herniotomy, prostatectomy, or
appendectomy.

_clinical features._--the most typical example of this form of phlebitis
is that so frequently met with in the great saphena vein, especially
when it is varicose. the onset of the attack is indicated by a sudden
pain in the lower limb--sometimes below, sometimes above the knee. this
initial pain may be associated with shivering or even with a rigor, and
the temperature usually rises one or two degrees. there is swelling and
tenderness along the line of the affected vein, and the skin over it is
a dull-red or purple colour. the swollen vein may be felt as a firm
cord, with bead-like enlargements in the position of the valves. the
patient experiences a feeling of stiffness and tightness throughout the
limb. there is often oedema of the leg and foot, especially when the limb
is in the dependent position. the acute symptoms pass off in a few days,
but the swelling and tenderness of the vein and the oedema of the limb
may last for many weeks.

when the deep veins--iliac, femoral, popliteal--are involved, there is
great swelling of the whole limb, which is of a firm almost "wooden"
consistence, and of a pale-white colour; the oedema may be so great that
it is impossible to feel the affected vein until the swelling has
subsided. this is most often seen in puerperal women, and is known as
_phlegmasia alba dolens_.

_treatment._--the patient must be placed at absolute rest, with the foot
of the bed raised on blocks 10 or 12 inches high, and the limb
immobilised by sand-bags or splints. it is necessary to avoid handling
the parts, lest the clot be displaced and embolism occur. to avoid
frequent movement of the limb, the necessary dressings should be kept in
position by means of a many-tailed rather than a roller bandage.

to relieve the pain, warm fomentations or lead and opium lotion should
be applied. later, ichthyol-glycerin, or glycerin and belladonna, may be
substituted.

when, at the end of three weeks, the danger of embolism is past,
douching and gentle massage may be employed to disperse the oedema; and
when the patient gets up he should wear a supporting elastic bandage.

the _infective_ form usually begins as a peri-phlebitis arising in
connection with some focus of infection in the adjacent tissues. the
elements of the vessel wall are destroyed by suppuration, and the
thrombus in its lumen becomes infected with pyogenic bacteria and
undergoes softening.

_occlusion of the inferior vena cava_ as a result of infective
thrombosis is a well-known condition, the thrombosis extending into the
main trunk from some of its tributaries, either from the femoral or
iliac veins below or from the hepatic veins above.

portions of the softened thrombus are liable to become detached and to
enter the circulating blood, in which they are carried as emboli. these
may lodge in distant parts, and give rise to secondary foci of
suppuration--pyaemic abscesses.

_clinical features._--infective phlebitis is most frequently met with in
the transverse sinus as a sequel to chronic suppuration in the mastoid
antrum and middle ear. it also occurs in relation to the peripheral
veins, but in these it can seldom be recognised as a separate entity,
being merged in the general infective process from which it takes
origin. its occurrence may be inferred, if in the course of a
suppurative lesion there is a sudden rise of temperature, with pain,
redness, and swelling along the line of a venous trunk, and a rapidly
developed oedema of the limb, with pitting of the skin on pressure. in
rare cases a localised abscess forms in the vein and points towards the
surface.

_treatment._--attention must be directed towards the condition with
which the phlebitis is associated. ligation of the vein on the cardiac
side of the thrombus with a view to preventing embolism is seldom
feasible in the peripheral veins, although, as will be pointed out
later, the jugular vein is ligated with this object in cases of
phlebitis of the transverse sinus.


varix--varicose veins

the term varix is applied to a condition in which veins are so altered
in structure that they remain permanently dilated, and are at the same
time lengthened and tortuous. two types are met with: one in which
dilatation of a large superficial vein and its tributaries is the most
obvious feature; the other, in which bunches of distended and tortuous
vessels develop at one or more points in the course of a vein, a
condition to which virchow applied the term _angioma racemosum venosum_.
the two types may occur in combination.

any vein in the body may become varicose, but the condition is rare
except in the veins of the lower extremity, in the veins of the
spermatic cord (varicocele), and in the veins of the anal canal
(haemorrhoids).

we are here concerned with varix as it occurs in the veins of the lower
extremity.

_etiology._--considerable difference of opinion exists as to the
essential cause of varix. the weight of evidence is in favour of the
view that, when dilatation is the predominant element, it results from a
congenital deficiency in the number, size, and strength of the valves of
the affected veins, and in an inherent weakness in the vessel walls.
the _angioma racemosum venosum_ is probably also due to a congenital
alteration in the structure of the vessels, and is allied to tumours of
blood vessels. the view that varix is congenital in origin, as was first
suggested by virchow, is supported by the fact that in a large
proportion of cases the condition is hereditary; not only may several
members of the same family in succeeding generations suffer from varix,
but it is often found that the same vein, or segment of a vein, is
involved in all of them. the frequent occurrence of varix in youth is
also an indication of its congenital origin.

in the majority of cases it is only when some exciting factor comes into
operation that the clinical phenomena associated with varix appear. the
most common exciting cause is increased pressure within the veins, and
this may be produced in a variety of ways. in certain diseases of the
heart, lungs, and liver, for example, the venous pressure may be so
raised as to cause a localised dilatation of such veins as are
congenitally weak. the direct pressure of a tumour, or of the gravid
uterus on the large venous trunks in the pelvis, may so obstruct the
flow as to distend the veins of the lower extremity. it is a common
experience in women that the signs of varix date from an antecedent
pregnancy. the importance of the wearing of tight garters as a factor in
the production of varicose veins has been exaggerated, although it must
be admitted that this practice is calculated to aggravate the condition
when it is once established. it has been proved experimentally that the
backward pressure in the veins may be greatly increased by straining, a
fact which helps to explain the frequency with which varicosity occurs
in the lower limbs of athletes and of those whose occupation involves
repeated and violent muscular efforts. there is reason to believe,
moreover, that a sudden strain may, by rupturing the valves and so
rendering them incompetent, induce varicosity independently of any
congenital defect. prolonged standing or walking, by allowing gravity to
act on the column of blood in the veins of the lower limbs, is also an
important determining factor in the production of varix.

thrombosis of the deep veins--in the leg, for example--may induce marked
dilatation of the superficial veins, by throwing an increased amount of
work upon them. this is to be looked upon rather as a compensatory
hypertrophy of the superficial vessels than as a true varix.

_morbid anatomy._--in the lower extremity the varicosity most commonly
affects the vessels of the great saphena system; less frequently those
of the small saphena system. sometimes both systems are involved, and
large communicating branches may develop between the two.

the essential lesion is the absence or deficiency of valves, so that
they are incompetent and fail to support the column of blood which bears
back upon them. normally the valves in the femoral and iliac veins and
in the inferior vena cava are imperfectly developed, so that in the
erect posture the great saphena receives a large share of the backward
pressure of the column of venous blood.

the whole length of the vein may be affected, but as a rule the disease
is confined to one or more segments, which are not only dilated, but are
also increased in length, so that they become convoluted. the adjacent
loops of the convoluted vein are often bound together by fibrous tissue.
all the coats are thickened, chiefly by an increased development of
connective tissue, and in some cases changes similar to those of
arterio-sclerosis occur. the walls of varicose veins are often
exceedingly brittle. in some cases the thickening is uniform, and in
others it is irregular, so that here and there thin-walled sacs or
pouches project from the side of the vein. these pouches vary in size
from a bean to a hen's egg, the larger forms being called _venous
cysts_, and being most commonly met with in the region of the saphenous
opening and of the opening in the popliteal fascia. such pouches, being
exposed to injury, are frequently the seat of thrombosis (fig. 66).

[illustration: fig. 66.--thrombosis in tortuous and pouched great
saphena vein, in longitudinal section.]

_clinical features._--varix is most frequently met with between puberty
and the age of thirty, and the sexes appear to suffer about equally.

the amount of discomfort bears no direct proportion to the extent of
the varicosity. it depends rather upon the degree of pressure in the
veins, as is shown by the fact that it is relieved by elevation of the
limb. when the whole length of the main trunk of the great saphena is
implicated, the pressure in the vein is high and the patient suffers a
good deal of pain and discomfort. when, on the contrary, the upper part
of the saphena and its valves are intact, and only the more distal veins
are involved, the pressure is not so high and there is comparatively
little suffering. the usual complaint is of a sense of weight and
fulness in the limb after standing or walking, sometimes accompanied by
actual pain, from which relief is at once obtained by raising the limb.
cramp-like pains in the muscles are often associated with varix of the
deep veins.

the dilated and tortuous vein can be readily seen and felt when the
patient is examined in the upright posture. in advanced cases, bead-like
swellings are sometimes to be detected over the position of the valves,
and, on running the fingers along the course of the vessel, a firm
ridge, due to periphlebitis, may be detected on each side of the vein.
when the limb is oedematous, the outline of the veins is obscured, but
they can be identified on palpation as gutter-like tracks. when large
veins are implicated, a distinct impulse on coughing may be seen to pass
down as far as the knee; and if the vessel is sharply percussed a fluid
wave may be detected passing both up and down the vein.

if the patient is placed on a couch and the limb elevated, the veins are
emptied, and if pressure is then made over the region of the saphenous
opening and the patient allowed to stand up, so long as the great
saphena system alone is involved, the veins fill again very slowly from
below. if the small saphena system also is involved, and if
communicating branches are dilated, the veins fill up from below more
rapidly. when the pressure over the saphenous opening is removed, the
blood rapidly rushes into the varicose vessels from above; this is known
as trendelenburg's test.

the most marked dilatation usually occurs on the medial side of the
limb, between the middle of the thigh and the middle of the calf, the
arrangement of the veins showing great variety (fig. 67).

there are usually one or more bunches of enlarged and tortuous veins in
the region of the knee. frequently a large branch establishes a
communication between the systems of the great and small saphenous veins
in the region of the popliteal space, or across the front of the upper
part of the tibia. the superficial position of this last branch and its
proximity to the bone render it liable to injury.

[illustration: fig. 67.--extensive varix of internal saphena system on
left leg, of many years' standing.]

the small veins of the skin of the ankle and foot often show as fine
blue streaks arranged in a stellate or arborescent manner, especially in
women who have borne children.

_complications._--when the varix is of long standing, the skin in the
lower part of the leg sometimes assumes a mahogany-brown or bluish hue,
as a result of the _deposit of blood pigment_ in the tissues, and this
is frequently a precursor of ulceration.

_chronic dermatitis_ (_varicose eczema_) is often met with in the lower
part of the leg, and is due to interference with the nutrition of the
skin. the incompetence of the valves allows the pressure in the varicose
veins to equal that in the arterioles, so that the capillary circulation
is impeded. from the same cause the blood in the deep veins is enabled
to enter the superficial veins, where the backward pressure is so great
that the blood flows down again, and so a vicious circle is established.
the blood therefore loses more and more of its oxygen, and so fails to
nourish the tissues.

the _ulcer_ of the leg associated with varicose veins has already been
described.

_haemorrhage_ may take place from a varicose vein as a result of a wound
or of ulceration of its wall. increased intra-venous pressure produced
by severe muscular strain may determine rupture of a vein exposed in the
floor of an ulcer. if the limb is dependent, the incompetency of the
valves permits of rapid and copious bleeding, which may prove fatal,
particularly if the patient is intoxicated when the rupture takes place
and no means are taken to arrest the haemorrhage. the bleeding may be
arrested at once by elevating the limb, or by applying pressure directly
over the bleeding point.

_phlebitis and thrombosis_ are common sequelae of varix, and may prove
dangerous, either by spreading into the large venous trunks or by giving
rise to emboli. the larger the varix the greater is the tendency for a
thrombus to spread upwards and to involve the deep veins. thrombi
usually originate in venous cysts or pouches, and at acute bends on the
vessel, especially when these are situated in the vicinity of the knee,
and are subjected to repeated injuries--for example in riding.
phleboliths sometimes form in such pouches, and may be recognised in a
radiogram. in a certain proportion of cases, especially in elderly
people, the occurrence of thrombosis leads to cure of the condition by
the thrombus becoming organised and obliterating the vein.

_treatment._--at best the treatment of varicose veins is only
palliative, as it is obviously impossible to restore to the vessels
their normal structure. the patient must avoid wearing anything, such as
a garter, which constricts the limb, and any obvious cause of direct
pressure on the pelvic veins, such as a tumour, persistent
constipation, or an ill-fitting truss, should be removed. cardiac,
renal, or pulmonary causes of venous congestion must also be treated,
and the functions of the liver regulated. severe forms of muscular
exertion and prolonged standing or walking are to be avoided, and the
patient may with benefit rest the limb in an elevated position for a few
hours each day. to support the distended vessels, a closely woven silk
or worsted stocking, or a light and porous form of elastic bandage,
applied as a puttee, should be worn. these appliances should be put on
before the patient leaves his bed in the morning, and should only be
removed after he lies down at night. in this way the vessels are never
allowed to become dilated. elastic stockings, and bandages made entirely
of india-rubber, are to be avoided. in early and mild cases these
measures are usually sufficient to relieve the patient's discomfort.

_operative treatment._--in aggravated cases, when the patient is
suffering pain, when his occupation is interfered with by repeated
attacks of phlebitis, or when there are large pouches on the veins,
operative treatment is called for. the younger the patient the clearer
is the indication to operate. it may be necessary to operate to enable a
patient to enter one of the public services, even although no symptoms
are present. the presence of an ulcer does not contra-indicate
operation; the ulcer should be excised, and the raw surface covered with
skin grafts, before dealing with the veins.

the _operation of trendelenburg_ is especially appropriate to cases in
which the trunk of the great saphena vein in the thigh is alone
involved. it consists in exposing three or four inches of the vein in
its upper part, applying a ligature at the upper and lower ends of the
exposed portion, and, after tying all tributary branches, resecting this
portion of the vein.

the procedure of c. h. mayo is adapted to cases in which it is desirable
to remove longer segments of the veins. it consists in the employment of
special instruments known as "ring-enucleators" or "vein-strippers," by
means of which long portions of the vein are removed through
comparatively small incisions.

an alternative procedure consists in avulsing segments of the vein by
means of babcock's stylet, which consists of a flexible steel rod, 30
inches in length, with acorn-shaped terminals. the instrument is passed
along the lumen of the segment to be dealt with, and a ligature applied
around the vein above the bulbous end of the stylet enables nearly the
whole length of the great saphena vein to be dragged out in one piece.
these methods are not suitable when the veins are brittle, when there
are pouches or calcareous deposits in their walls, or where there has
been periphlebitis binding the coils together.

mitchell of belfast advises exposing the varices at numerous points by
half-inch incisions, and, after clamping the vein between two pairs of
forceps, cutting it across and twisting out the segments of the vein
between adjacent incisions. the edges of the incisions are sutured; and
the limb is firmly bandaged from below upwards, and kept in an elevated
position. we have employed this method with satisfactory results.

the treatment of the complications of varix has already been considered.


angioma[4]

[4] in the description of angiomas we have followed the teaching of the
late john duncan.

tumours of blood vessels may be divided, according to the nature of the
vessels of which they are composed, into the capillary, the venous, and
the arterial angiomas.


capillary angioma

the most common form of capillary angioma is the naevus or congenital
telangiectasis.

#naevus.#--a naevus is a collection of dilated capillaries, the afferent
arterioles and the efferent venules of which often share in the
dilatation. little is known regarding the _etiology_ of naevi beyond the
fact that they are of congenital origin. they often escape notice until
the child is some days old, but attention is usually drawn to them
within a fortnight of birth. for practical purposes the most useful
classification of naevi is into the cutaneous, the subcutaneous, and the
mixed forms.

_the cutaneous naevus_, "mother's mark," or "port-wine stain," consists
of an aggregation of dilated capillaries in the substance of the skin.
on stretching the skin the vessels can be seen to form a fine network,
or to run in leashes parallel to one another. a dilated arteriole or a
vein winding about among the capillaries may sometimes be detected.
these naevi occur on any part of the body, but they are most frequently
met with on the face. they may be multiple, and vary greatly in size,
some being no bigger than a pin-head, while others cover large areas of
the body. in colour they present every tint from purple to brilliant
red; in the majority there is a considerable dash of blue, especially in
cold weather.

unlike the other forms of naevi, the cutaneous variety shows little
tendency to disappear, and it is especially persistent when associated
with overgrowth of the epidermis and of the hairs--_naevoid mole_.

the _treatment_ of the cutaneous naevus is unsatisfactory, owing to the
difficulty of removing the naevus without leaving a scar which is even
more disfiguring. very small naevi may be destroyed by a fine pointed
paquelin thermo-cautery, or by escharotics, such as nitric acid. for
larger naevi, radium and solidified carbon dioxide ("co_2 snow") may be
used. the extensive port-wine stains so often met with on the face are
best left alone.

the _subcutaneous naevus_ is comparatively rare. it constitutes a
well-defined, localised tumour, which may possess a distinct capsule,
especially when it has ceased to grow or is retrogressing. on section,
it presents the appearance of a finely reticulated sponge.

although it may be noticed at, or within a few days of, birth, a
subcutaneous naevus is often overlooked, especially when on a covered
part of the body, and may not be discovered till the patient is some
years old. it forms a rounded, lobulated swelling, seldom of large size
and yielding a sensation like that of a sponge; the skin over it is
normal, or may exhibit a bluish tinge, especially in cold weather. in
some cases the tumour is diminished by pressing the blood out of it, but
slowly fills again when the pressure is relaxed, and it swells up when
the child struggles or cries. from a cold abscess it is diagnosed by the
history and progress of the swelling and by the absence of fluctuation.
when situated over one of the hernial openings, it closely simulates a
hernia; and when it occurs in the middle line of the face, head, or
back, it may be mistaken for such other congenital conditions as
meningocele or spina bifida. when other means fail, the use of an
exploring needle clears up the diagnosis.

_mixed naevus._--as its name indicates, the mixed naevus partakes of the
characters of the other two varieties; that is, it is a subcutaneous
naevus with involvement of the skin.

it is frequently met with on the face and head, but may occur on any
part of the body. it also affects parts covered by mucous membrane, such
as the cheek, tongue, and soft palate. the swelling is rounded or
lobulated, and projects beyond the level of its surroundings. sometimes
the skin is invaded by the naevoid tissue over the whole extent of the
tumour, sometimes only over a limited area. frequently the margin only
is of a bright-red colour, while the skin in the centre resembles a
cicatrix. the swelling is reduced by steady pressure, and increases in
size and becomes tense when the child cries.

[illustration: fig. 68.--mixed naevus of nose which was subsequently
cured by electrolysis.]

_prognosis._--the rate of growth of the subcutaneous and mixed forms of
naevi varies greatly. they sometimes increase rapidly, especially during
the first few months of life; after this they usually grow at the same
rate as the child, or more slowly. there is a decided tendency to
disappearance of these varieties, fully 50 per cent. undergoing natural
cure by a process of obliteration, similar to the obliteration of
vessels in cicatricial tissue. this usually begins about the period of
the first dentition, sometimes at the second dentition, and sometimes at
puberty. on the other hand, an increased activity of growth may be shown
at these periods. the onset of natural cure is recognised by the tumour
becoming firmer and less compressible, and, in the mixed variety, by the
colour becoming less bright. injury, infection, or ulceration of the
overlying skin may initiate the curative process.

towards adult life the spaces in a subcutaneous naevus may become greatly
enlarged, leading to the formation of a cavernous angioma.

_treatment._--in view of the frequency with which subcutaneous and mixed
naevi disappear spontaneously, interference is only called for when the
growth of the tumour is out of proportion to that of the child, or when,
from its situation--for example in the vicinity of the eye--any marked
increase in its size would render it less amenable to treatment.

the methods of treatment most generally applicable are the use of radium
and carbon dioxide snow, igni-puncture, electrolysis, and excision.

for naevi situated on exposed parts, where it is desirable to avoid a
scar, the use of _radium_ is to be preferred. the tube of radium is
applied at intervals to different parts of the naevus, the duration and
frequency of the applications varying with the strength of the
emanations and the reaction produced. the object aimed at is to induce
obliteration of the naevoid tissue by cicatricial contraction without
destroying the overlying skin. _carbon-dioxide snow_ may be employed in
the same manner, but the results are inferior to those obtained by
radium.

_igni-puncture_ consists in making a number of punctures at different
parts of the naevus with a fine-pointed thermo-cautery, with the object
of starting at each point a process of cicatrisation which extends
throughout the naevoid tissue and so obliterates the vessels.

_electrolysis_ acts by decomposing the blood and tissues into their
constituent elements--oxygen and acids appearing at the positive,
hydrogen and bases at the negative electrode. these substances and gases
being given off in a nascent condition, at once enter into new
combinations with anything in the vicinity with which they have a
chemical affinity. in the naevus the practical result of this reaction is
that at the positive pole nitric acid, and at the negative pole caustic
potash, both in a state of minute subdivision, make their appearance.
the effect on the tissues around the positive pole, therefore, is
equivalent to that of an acid cauterisation, and on those round the
negative pole, to an alkaline cauterisation.

as the process is painful, a general anaesthetic is necessary. the
current used should be from 20 to 80 milliamperes, gradually increasing
from zero, without shock; three to six large bunsen cells give a
sufficient current, and no galvanometer is required. steel needles,
insulated with vulcanite to within an eighth of an inch of their points,
are the best. both poles are introduced into the naevus, the positive
being kept fixed at one spot, while the negative is moved about so as to
produce a number of different tracks of cauterisation. on no account
must either pole be allowed to come in contact with the skin, lest a
slough be formed. the duration of the sitting is determined by the
effect produced, as indicated by the hardening of the tumour, the
average duration being from fifteen to twenty minutes. if pallor of the
skin appears, it indicates that the needles are too near the surface, or
that the blood supply to the integument is being cut off, and is an
indication to stop. to cauterise the track and so prevent bleeding, the
needles should be slowly withdrawn while the current is flowing. when
the skin is reached the current is turned off. the punctures are covered
with collodion. six or eight weeks should be allowed to elapse before
repeating the procedure. from two to eight or ten sittings may be
necessary, according to the size and character of the naevus.

_excision_ is to be preferred for naevi of moderate size situated on
covered parts of the body, where a scar is of no importance. its chief
advantages over electrolysis are that a single operation is sufficient,
and that the cure is speedy and certain. the operation is attended with
much less haemorrhage than might be expected.

#cavernous angioma.#--this form of angioma consists of a series of large
blood spaces which are usually derived from the dilatation of the
capillaries of a subcutaneous naevus. the spaces come to communicate
freely with one another by the disappearance of adjacent capillary
walls. while the most common situation is in the subcutaneous tissue, a
cavernous angioma is sometimes met with in internal organs. it may
appear at any age from early youth to middle life, and is of slow growth
and may become stationary. the swelling is rounded or oval, there is no
pulsation or bruit, and the tumour is but slightly compressible. the
treatment consists in dissecting it out.

#aneurysm by anastomosis# is the name applied to a vascular tumour in
which the arteries, veins, and capillaries are all involved. it is met
with chiefly on the upper part of the trunk, the neck, and the scalp. it
tends gradually to increase in size, and may, after many years, attain
an enormous size. the tumour is ill-defined, and varies in consistence.
it is pulsatile, and a systolic bruit or a "thrilling" murmur may be
heard over it. the chief risk is haemorrhage from injury or ulceration.

[illustration: fig. 69.--cirsoid aneurysm of forehead in a boy aet. 10.

(mr. j. w. dowden's case.)]

the _treatment_ is conducted on the same lines as for naevus. when
electrolysis is employed, it should be directed towards the afferent
vessels; and if it fails to arrest the flow through these, it is useless
to persist with it. in some cases ligation of the afferent vessels has
been successful.

#arterial angioma# or #cirsoid aneurysm#.--this is composed of the
enlarged branches of an arterial trunk. it originates in the smaller
branches of an artery--usually the temporal--and may spread to the main
trunk, and may even involve branches of other trunks with which the
affected artery anastomoses.

the condition is probably congenital in origin, though its appearance is
frequently preceded by an injury. it almost invariably occurs in the
scalp, and is usually met with in adolescent young adults.

the affected vessels slowly increase in size, and become tortuous, with
narrowings and dilatations here and there. grooves and gutters are
frequently found in the bone underlying the dilated vessels.

there is a constant loud bruit in the tumour, which greatly troubles the
patient and may interfere with sleep. there is no tendency either to
natural cure or to rupture, but severe and even fatal haemorrhage may
follow a wound of the dilated vessels.

[illustration: fig. 70.--cirsoid aneurysm of orbit and face, which
developed after a blow on the orbit with a cricket ball.

(from a photograph lent by sir montagu cotterill.)]

the condition may be treated by excision or by electrolysis. in excision
the haemorrhage is controlled by an elastic tourniquet applied
horizontally round the head, or by ligation of the feeding trunks. in
large tumours the bleeding is formidable. in many cases electrolysis is
to be preferred, and is performed in the same way as for naevus. the
positive pole is placed in the centre of the tumour, while the negative
is introduced into the main affluents one after another.


aneurysm

an aneurysm is a sac communicating with an artery, and containing fluid
or coagulated blood.

two types are met with--the pathological and the traumatic. it is
convenient to describe in this section also certain conditions in which
there is an abnormal communication between an artery and a
vein--arterio-venous aneurysm.


pathological aneurysm

in this class are included such dilatations as result from weakening of
the arterial coats, combined, in most cases, with a loss of elasticity
in the walls and increase in the arterial tension due to
arterio-sclerosis. in some cases the vessel wall is softened by
arteritis--especially the embolic form--so that it yields before the
pressure of the blood.

repeated and sudden raising of the arterial tension, as a result, for
example, of violent muscular efforts or of excessive indulgence in
alcohol, plays an important part in the causation of aneurysm. these
factors probably explain the comparative frequency of aneurysm in those
who follow such arduous occupations as soldiers, sailors,
dock-labourers, and navvies. in these classes the condition usually
manifests itself between the ages of thirty and fifty--that is, when the
vessels are beginning to degenerate, although the heart is still
vigorous and the men are hard at work. the comparative immunity of women
may also be explained by the less severe muscular strain involved by
their occupations and recreations.

syphilis plays an important part in the production of aneurysm, probably
by predisposing the patient to arterio-sclerosis and atheroma, and
inducing an increase in the vascular tension in the peripheral vessels,
from loss of elasticity of the vessel wall and narrowing of the lumen as
a result of syphilitic arteritis. it is a striking fact that aneurysm is
seldom met with in women who have not suffered from syphilis.

#varieties--fusiform aneurysm.#--when the _whole circumference_ of an
artery has been weakened, the tension of the blood causes the walls to
dilate uniformly, so that a fusiform or tubular aneurysm results. all
the coats of the vessel are stretched and form the sac of the aneurysm,
and the affected portion is not only dilated but is also increased in
length. this form is chiefly met with in the arch of the aorta, but may
occur in any of the main arterial trunks. as the sac of the aneurysm
includes all three coats, and as the inner and outer coats are usually
thickened by the deposit in them of connective tissue, this variety
increases in size slowly and seldom gives rise to urgent symptoms.

as a rule a fusiform aneurysm contains fluid blood, but when the intima
is roughened by disease, especially in the form of calcareous plates,
shreds of clot may adhere to it.

it has little tendency to natural cure, although this is occasionally
effected by the emerging artery becoming occluded by a clot; it has also
little tendency to rupture.

#sacculated aneurysm.#--when a _limited area_ of the vessel wall is
weakened--for example by atheroma or by other form of arteritis--this
portion yields before the pressure of the blood, and a sacculated
aneurysm results. the internal and middle coats being already damaged,
or, it may be, destroyed, by the primary disease, the stress falls on
the external coat, which in the majority of cases constitutes the sac.
to withstand the pressure the external coat becomes thickened, and as
the aneurysm increases in size it forms adhesions to surrounding
tissues, so that fasciae, tendons, nerves, and other structures may be
found matted together in its wall. the wall is further strengthened by
the deposit on its inner aspect of blood-clot, which may eventually
become organised.

the contents of the sac consist of fluid blood and a varying amount of
clot which is deposited in concentric layers on the inner aspect of the
sac, where it forms a pale, striated, firm mass, which constitutes a
laminated clot. near the blood-current the clot is soft, red, and
friable (fig. 72). the laminated clot not only strengthens the sac,
enabling it to resist the blood-pressure and so prevent rupture, but, if
it increases sufficiently to fill the cavity, may bring about cure. the
principle upon which all methods of treatment are based is to imitate
nature in producing such a clot.

sacculated aneurysm, as compared with the fusiform variety, tends to
rupture and also to cure by the formation of laminated clot; natural
cure is sometimes all but complete when extension and rupture occur and
cause death.

an aneurysm is said to be _diffused_ when the sac ruptures and the blood
escapes into the cellular tissue.

#clinical features of aneurysm.#--surgically, the sacculated is by far
the most important variety. the outstanding feature is the existence in
the line of an artery of a globular swelling, which pulsates. the
pulsation is of an expansile character, which is detected by observing
that when both hands are placed over the swelling they are separated
with each beat of the heart. if the main artery be compressed on the
cardiac side of the swelling, the pulsation is arrested and the tumour
becomes smaller and less tense, and it may be still further reduced in
size by gentle pressure being made over it so as to empty it of fluid
blood. on allowing the blood again to flow through the artery, the
pulsation returns at once, but several beats are required before the sac
regains its former size. in most cases a distinct thrill is felt on
placing the hand over the swelling, and a blowing, systolic murmur may
be heard with the stethoscope. it is to be borne in mind that
occasionally, when the interchange of blood between an aneurysm and the
artery from which it arises is small, pulsation and bruit may be slight
or even absent. this is also the case when the sac contains a
considerable quantity of clot. when it becomes filled with
clot--_consolidated aneurysm_--these signs disappear, and the clinical
features are those of a solid tumour lying in contact with an artery,
and transmitting its pulsation.

a comparison of the pulse in the artery beyond the seat of the aneurysm
with that in the corresponding artery on the healthy side, shows that on
the affected side the wave is smaller in volume, and delayed in time. a
pulse tracing shows that the normal impulse and dicrotic waves are lost,
and that the force and rapidity of the tidal wave are diminished.

[illustration: fig. 71.--radiogram of aneurysm of aorta, showing
laminated clot and erosion of bodies of vertebrae. the intervertebral
discs are intact.]

an aneurysm exerts pressure on the surrounding structures, which are
usually thickened and adherent to it and to one another. adjacent veins
may be so compressed that congestion and oedema of the parts beyond are
produced. pain, disturbances of sensation, and muscular paralyses may
result from pressure on nerves. such bones as the sternum and vertebrae
undergo erosion and are absorbed by the gradually increasing pressure of
the aneurysm. cartilage, on the other hand, being elastic, yields before
the pressure, so that the intervertebral discs or the costal cartilages
may escape while the adjacent bones are destroyed (fig. 71). the skin
over the tumour becomes thinned and stretched, until finally a slough
forms, and when it separates haemorrhage takes place.

[illustration: fig. 72.--sacculated aneurysm of abdominal aorta nearly
filled with laminated clot. note greater density of clot towards
periphery.]

in the progress of an aneurysm towards rupture, timely clotting may
avert death for the moment, but while extension in one direction has
been arrested there is apt to be extension in another, with imminence of
rupture, or it may be again postponed.

#differential diagnosis.#--the diagnosis is to be made from other
pulsatile swellings. pulsation is sometimes transmitted from a large
artery to a tumour, a mass of enlarged lymph glands, or an inflammatory
swelling which lies in its vicinity, but the pulsation is not
expansile--a most important point in differential diagnosis. such
swellings may, by appropriate manipulation, be moved from the artery and
the pulsation ceases, and compression of the artery on the cardiac side
of the swelling, although it arrests the pulsation, does not produce any
diminution in the size or tension of the swelling, and when the pressure
is removed the pulsation is restored immediately.

fluid swellings overlying an artery, such as cysts, abscesses, or
enlarged bursae, may closely simulate aneurysm. an apparent expansion may
accompany the pulsation, but careful examination usually enables this to
be distinguished from the true expansion of an aneurysm. compression of
the artery makes no difference in the size or tension of the swelling.

vascular tumours, such as sarcoma and goitre, may yield an expansile
pulsation and a soft, whifling bruit, but they differ from an aneurysm
in that they are not diminished in size by compression of the main
artery, nor can they be emptied by pressure.

the exaggerated pulsation sometimes observed in the abdominal aorta, the
"pulsating aorta" seen in women, should not be mistaken for aneurysm.

#prognosis.#--when _natural cure_ occurs it is usually brought about by
the formation of laminated clot, which gradually increases in amount
till it fills the sac. sometimes a portion of the clot in the sac is
separated and becomes impacted as an embolus in the artery beyond,
leading to thrombosis which first occludes the artery and then extends
into the sac.

the progress of natural cure is indicated by the aneurysm becoming
smaller, firmer, less expansile, and less compressible; the murmur and
thrill diminish and the pressure effects become less marked. when the
cure is complete the expansile pulsation is lost, and there remains a
firm swelling attached to the vessel (_consolidated aneurysm_). while
these changes are taking place the collateral arteries become enlarged,
and an anastomotic circulation is established.

an aneurysm may prove _fatal_ by exerting pressure on important
structures, by causing syncope, by rupture, or from the occurrence of
suppuration. _pressure_ symptoms are usually most serious from aneurysms
situated in the neck, thorax, or skull. sudden fatal _syncope_ is not
infrequent in cases of aneurysm of the thoracic aorta.

_rupture_ may take place through the skin, on a mucous or serous
surface, or into the cellular tissue. the first haemorrhage is often
slight and stops naturally, but it soon recurs, and is so profuse,
especially when the blood escapes externally, that it rapidly proves
fatal. when the bleeding takes place into the cellular tissue, the
aneurysm is said to become _diffused_, and the extravasated blood
spreads widely through the tissues, exerting great pressure on the
surrounding structures.

the _clinical features_ associated with rupture are sudden and severe
pain in the part, and the patient becomes pale, cold, and faint. if a
comparatively small escape of blood takes place into the tissues, the
sudden alteration in the size, shape, and tension of the aneurysm,
together with loss of pulsation, may be the only local signs. when the
bleeding is profuse, however, the parts beyond the aneurysm become
greatly swollen, livid, and cold, and the pulse beyond is completely
lost. the arrest of the blood supply may result in gangrene. sometimes
the pressure of the extravasated blood causes the skin to slough and,
later, give way, and fatal haemorrhage results.

the _treatment_ is carried out on the same lines as for a ruptured
artery (p. 261), it being remembered, however, that the artery is
diseased and does not lend itself to reconstructive procedures.

_suppuration_ may occur in the vicinity of an aneurysm, and the aneurysm
may burst into the abscess which forms, so that when the latter points
the pus is mixed with broken-down blood-clot, and finally free
haemorrhage takes place. it has more than once happened that a surgeon
has incised such an abscess without having recognised its association
with aneurysm, with tragic results.

#treatment.#--in treating an aneurysm, the indications are to imitate
nature's method of cure by means of laminated clot.

_constitutional treatment_ consists in taking measures to reduce the
arterial tension and to diminish the force of the heart's action. the
patient must be kept in bed. a dry and non-stimulating diet is
indicated, the quantity being gradually reduced till it is just
sufficient to maintain nutrition. saline purges are employed to reduce
the vascular tension. the benefit derived from potassium iodide
administered in full doses, as first recommended by george w. balfour,
probably depends on its depressing action on the heart and its
therapeutic benefit in syphilis. pain or restlessness may call for the
use of opiates, of which heroin is the most efficient.

_local treatment._--when constitutional treatment fails, local measures
must be adopted, and many methods are available.

#endo-aneurysmorrhaphy.#--the operation devised by rudolf matas in 1888
aims at closing the opening between the sac and its feeding artery, and
in addition, folding the wall of the sac in such a way as to leave no
vacant space. if there is marked disease of the vessel, matas' operation
is not possible and recourse is then had to ligation of the artery just
above the sac.

_extirpation of the sac--the old operation._--the procedure which goes
by this name consists in exposing the aneurysm, incising the sac,
clearing out the clots, and ligating the artery above and below the sac.
this method is suitable to sacculated aneurysm of the limbs, so long as
they are circumscribed and free from complications. it has been
successfully practised also in aneurysm of the subclavian, carotid, and
external iliac arteries. it is not applicable to cases in which there is
such a degree of atheroma as would interfere with the successful
ligation of the artery. the continuity of the artery may be restored by
grafting into the gap left after excision of the sac a segment of the
great saphena vein.

_ligation of the artery._--the object of tying the artery is to diminish
or to arrest the flow of blood through the aneurysm so that the blood
coagulates both in the sac and in the feeding artery. the ligature may
be applied on the cardiac side of the aneurysm--proximal ligation, or to
the artery beyond--distal ligation.

_proximal ligation._--the ligature may be applied immediately above the
sac (anel, 1710) or at a distance above (john hunter, 1785). the
_hunterian operation_ ensures that the ligature is applied to a part of
the artery that is presumably healthy and where relations are
undisturbed by the proximity of the sac; the best example is the
ligation of the superficial femoral artery in scarpa's triangle or in
hunter's canal for popliteal aneurysm; it is on record that syme
performed this operation with cure of the aneurysm on thirty-nine
occasions.

it is to be noted that the hunterian ligature does not aim at
_arresting_ the flow of blood through the sac, but is designed so to
diminish its volume and force as to favour the deposition within the sac
of laminated clot. the development of the collateral circulation which
follows upon ligation of the artery at a distance above the sac may be
attended with just that amount of return stream which favours the
deposit of laminated clot, and consequently the cure of the aneurysm;
the return stream may, however, be so forcible as to prevent coagulation
of the blood in the sac, or only to allow of the formation of a red
thrombus which may in its turn be dispersed so that pulsation in the sac
recurs. this does not necessarily imply failure to cure, as the
recurrent pulsation may only be temporary; the formation of laminated
clot may ultimately take place and lead to consolidation of the
aneurysm.

the least desirable result of the hunterian ligature is met with in
cases where, owing to widespread arterial disease, the collateral
circulation does not develop and gangrene of the limb supervenes.

_anel's ligature_ is only practised as part of the operation which deals
with the sac directly.

_distal ligation._--the tying of the artery beyond the sac, or of its
two branches where it bifurcates (brasdor, 1760, and wardrop, 1825), may
arrest or only diminish the flow of blood through the sac. it is less
successful than the proximal ligature, and is therefore restricted to
aneurysms so situated as not to be amenable to other methods; for
example, in aneurysm of the common carotid near its origin, the artery
may be ligated near its bifurcation, or in aneurysm of the innominate
artery, the carotid and subclavian arteries are tied at the seat of
election.

_compression._--digital compression of the feeding artery has been given
up except as a preparation for operations on the sac with a view to
favouring the development of a collateral circulation.

_macewen's acupuncture or "needling"_ consists in passing one or more
fine, highly tempered steel needles through the tissues overlying the
aneurysm, and through its outer wall. the needles are made to touch the
opposite wall of the sac, and the pulsation of the aneurysm imparts a
movement to them which causes them to scarify the inner surface of the
sac. white thrombus forms on the rough surface produced, and leads to
further coagulation. the needles may be left in position for some hours,
being shifted from time to time, the projecting ends being surrounded
with sterile gauze.

the _moore-corradi method_ consists in introducing through the wall of
the aneurysm a hollow insulated needle, through the lumen of which from
10 to 20 feet of highly drawn silver or other wire is passed into the
sac, where it coils up into an open meshwork (fig. 73). the positive
pole of a galvanic battery is attached to the wire, and the negative
pole placed over the patient's back. a current, varying in strength from
20 to 70 milliamperes, is allowed to flow for about an hour. the hollow
needle is then withdrawn, but the wire is left _in situ_. the results
are somewhat similar to those obtained by needling, but the clot formed
on the large coil of wire is more extensive.

[illustration: fig. 73.--radiogram of innominate aneurysm after
treatment by the moore-corradi method. two feet of finely drawn silver
wire were introduced. the patient, a woman, aet. 47, lived for ten months
after operation, free from pain (cf. fig. 75).]

colt's method of wiring has been mainly used in the treatment of
abdominal aneurysm; gilt wire in the form of a wisp is introduced
through the cannula and expands into an umbrella shape.

_subcutaneous injections of gelatin._--three or four ounces of a 2 per
cent. solution of white gelatin in sterilised water, at a temperature of
about 100 o f., are injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen
every two, three, or four days. in the course of a fortnight or three
weeks improvement may begin. the clot which forms is liable to soften
and be absorbed, but a repetition of the injection has in several cases
established a permanent cure.

_amputation of the limb_ is indicated in cases complicated by
suppuration, by secondary haemorrhage after excision or ligation, or by
gangrene. amputation at the shoulder was performed by fergusson in a
case of subclavian aneurysm, as a means of arresting the blood-flow
through the sac.


traumatic aneurysm

the essential feature of a traumatic aneurysm is that it is produced by
some form of injury which divides all the coats of the artery. the walls
of the injured vessel are presumably healthy, but they form no part of
the sac of the aneurysm. the sac consists of the condensed and thickened
tissues around the artery.

the injury to the artery may be a subcutaneous one such as a tear by a
fragment of bone: much more commonly it is a punctured wound from a stab
or from a bullet.

the aneurysm usually forms soon after the injury is inflicted; the blood
slowly escapes into the surrounding tissues, gradually displacing and
condensing them, until they form a sac enclosing the effused blood.

less frequently a traumatic aneurysm forms some considerable time after
the injury, from gradual stretching of the fibrous cicatrix by which the
wound in the wall of the artery has been closed. the gradual stretching
of this cicatrix results in condensation of the surrounding structures
which form the sac, on the inner aspect of which laminated clot is
deposited.

a traumatic aneurysm is almost always sacculated, and, so long as it
remains circumscribed, has the same characters as a pathological
sacculated aneurysm, with the addition that there is a scar in the
overlying skin. a traumatic aneurysm is liable to become diffuse--a
change which, although attended with considerable risk of gangrene, has
sometimes been the means of bringing about a cure.

the treatment is governed by the same principles as apply to the
pathological varieties, but as the walls of the artery are not diseased,
operative measures dealing with the sac and the adjacent segment of the
affected artery are to be preferred.


arterio-venous aneurysm

an abnormal communication between an artery and a vein constitutes an
arterio-venous aneurysm. two varieties are recognised--one in which the
communication is direct--_aneurysmal varix_; the other in which the
vein communicates with the artery through the medium of a sac--_varicose
aneurysm_.

either variety may result from pathological causes, but in the majority
of cases they are traumatic in origin, being due to such injuries as
stabs, punctured wounds, and gun-shot injuries which involve both artery
and vein. in former times the most common situation was at the bend of
the elbow, the brachial artery being accidentally punctured in
blood-letting from the median basilic vein. arterio-venous aneurysm is a
frequent result of injuries by modern high-velocity bullets--for
example, in the neck or groin.

in _aneurysmal varix_ the higher blood pressure in the artery forces
arterial blood into the vein, which near the point of communication with
the artery tends to become dilated, and to form a thick-walled sac,
beyond which the vessel and its tributaries are distended and tortuous.
the clinical features resemble those associated with varicose veins, but
the entrance of arterial blood into the dilated veins causes them to
pulsate, and produces in them a vibratory thrill and a loud murmur. in
those at the groin, the distension of the veins may be so great that
they look like sinuses running through the muscles, a feature that must
be taken into account in any operation.

as the condition tends to remain stationary, the support of an elastic
bandage is all that is required; but when the condition progresses and
causes serious inconvenience, it may be necessary to cut down and expose
the communication between the artery and vein, and, after separating the
vessels, to close the opening in each by suture; this may be difficult
or impossible if the parts are matted from former suppuration. if it is
impossible thus to obliterate the communication, the artery should be
ligated above and below the point of communication; although the risk of
gangrene is considerable unless means are taken to develop the
collateral circulation beforehand (makins).

_varicose aneurysm_ usually develops in relation to a traumatic
aneurysm, the sac becoming adherent to an adjacent vein, and ultimately
opening into it. in this way a communication between the artery and the
vein is established, and the clinical features are those of a
combination of aneurysm and aneurysmal varix.

as there is little tendency to spontaneous cure, and as the aneurysm is
liable to increase in size and finally to rupture, operative treatment
is usually called for. this is carried out on the same lines as for
aneurysmal varix, and at the same time incising the sac, turning out the
clots, and ligating any branches which open into the sac. if it can be
avoided, the vein should not be ligated.


aneurysms of individual arteries

#thoracic aneurysm.#--all varieties of aneurysm occur in the aorta, the
fusiform being the most common, although a sacculated aneurysm
frequently springs from a fusiform dilatation.

the _clinical features_ depend chiefly on the direction in which the
aneurysm enlarges, and are not always well marked even when the sac is
of considerable size. they consist in a pulsatile swelling--sometimes in
the supra-sternal notch, but usually towards the right side of the
sternum--with an increased area of dulness on percussion. with the
x-rays a dark shadow is seen corresponding to the sac. pain is usually a
prominent symptom, and is largely referable to the pressure of the
aneurysm on the vertebrae or the sternum, causing erosion of these bones.
pressure on the thoracic veins and on the air-passage causes cyanosis
and dyspnoea. when the oesophagus is pressed upon, the patient may have
difficulty in swallowing. the left recurrent nerve may be stretched or
pressed upon as it hooks round the arch of the aorta, and hoarseness of
the voice and a characteristic "brassy" cough may result from paralysis
of the muscles of the larynx which it supplies. the vagus, the phrenic,
and the spinal nerves may also be pressed upon. when the aneurysm is on
the transverse part of the arch, the trachea is pulled down with each
beat of the heart--a clinical phenomena known as the "tracheal tug."
aneurysm of the descending aorta may, after eroding the bodies of the
vertebrae (fig. 71) and posterior portions of the ribs, form a swelling
in the back to the left of the spine.

inasmuch as obliteration of the sac and the feeding artery is out of the
question, surgical treatment is confined to causing coagulation of the
blood in an extension or pouching of the sac, which, making its way
through the parietes of the chest, threatens to rupture externally. this
may be achieved by macewen's needles or by the introduction of wire into
the sac. we have had cases under observation in which the treatment
referred to has been followed by such an amount of improvement that the
patient has been able to resume a laborious occupation for one or more
years. christopher heath found that improvement followed ligation of the
left common carotid in aneurysm of the transverse part of the aortic
arch.

[illustration: fig. 74.--thoracic aneurysm, threatening to rupture
externally, but prevented from doing so by macewen's needling. the
needles were left in for forty-eight hours.]

#abdominal aneurysm.#--aneurysm is much less frequent in the abdominal
than in the thoracic aorta. while any of the large branches in the
abdomen may be affected, the most common seats are in the aorta itself,
just above the origin of the coeliac artery and at the bifurcation.

the _clinical features_ vary with the site of the aneurysm and with its
rapidity and direction of growth. a smooth, rounded swelling, which
exhibits expansile pulsation, forms, usually towards the left of the
middle line. it may extend upwards under cover of the ribs, downwards
towards the pelvis, or backward towards the loin. on palpation a
systolic thrill may be detected, but the presence of a murmur is neither
constant nor characteristic. pain is usually present; it may be
neuralgic in character, or may simulate renal colic. when the aneurysm
presses on the vertebrae and erodes them, the symptoms simulate those of
spinal caries, particularly if, as sometimes happens, symptoms of
compression paraplegia ensue. in its growth the swelling may press upon
and displace the adjacent viscera, and so interfere with their
functions.

the _diagnosis_ has to be made from solid or cystic tumours overlying
the artery; from a "pulsating aorta"; and from spinal caries; much help
is obtained by the use of the x-rays.

the condition usually proves fatal, either by the aneurysm bursting into
the peritoneal cavity, or by slow leakage into the retro-peritoneal
tissue.

the moore-corradi method has been successfully employed, access to the
sac having been obtained by opening the abdomen. ligation of the aorta
has so far been unsuccessful, but in one case operated upon by keen the
patient survived forty-eight days.

#innominate aneurysm# may be of the fusiform or of the sacculated
variety, and is frequently associated with pouching of the aorta. it
usually grows upwards and laterally, projecting above the sternum and
right clavicle, which may be eroded or displaced (fig. 75). symptoms of
pressure on the structures in the neck, similar to those produced by
aortic aneurysm, occur. the pulses in the right upper extremity and in
the right carotid and its branches are diminished and delayed. pressure
on the right brachial plexus causes shooting pain down the arm and
muscular paresis on that side. vaso-motor disturbances and contraction
of the pupil on the right side may result from pressure on the
sympathetic. death may take place from rupture, or from pressure on the
air-passage.

[illustration: fig. 75.--innominate aneurysm in a woman, aet. 47, eight
months after treatment by moore-corradi method (cf. fig. 73).]

the available methods of treatment are ligation of the right common
carotid and third part of the right subclavian (wardrop's operation), of
which a number of successful cases have been recorded. those most
suitable for ligation are cases in which the aneurysm is circumscribed
and globular (sheen). if ligation is found to be impracticable, the
moore-corradi method or macewen's needling may be tried.

#carotid aneurysms.#--aneurysm of the _common carotid_ is more frequent
on the right than on the left side, and is usually situated either at
the root of the neck or near the bifurcation. it is the aneurysm most
frequently met with in women. from its position the swelling is liable
to press on the vagus, recurrent and sympathetic nerves, on the
air-passage, and on the oesophagus, giving rise to symptoms referable to
such pressure. there may be cerebral symptoms from interference with the
blood supply of the brain.

aneurysm near the origin has to be diagnosed from subclavian,
innominate, and aortic aneurysm, and from other swellings--solid or
fluid--met with in the neck. it is often difficult to determine with
precision the trunk from which an aneurysm at the root of the neck
originates, and not infrequently more than one vessel shares in the
dilatation. a careful consideration of the position in which the
swelling first appeared, of the direction in which it has progressed, of
its pressure effects, and of the condition of the pulses beyond, may
help in distinguishing between aortic, innominate, carotid, and
subclavian aneurysms. skiagraphy is also of assistance in recognising
the vessel involved.

tumours of the thyreoid, enlarged lymph glands, and fatty and
sarcomatous tumours can usually be distinguished from aneurysm by the
history of the swelling and by physical examination. cystic tumours and
abscesses in the neck are sometimes more difficult to differentiate on
account of the apparently expansile character of the pulsation
transmitted to them. the fact that compression of the vessel does not
affect the size and tension of these fluid swellings is useful in
distinguishing them from aneurysm.

_treatment._--digital compression of the vessel against the transverse
process of the sixth cervical vertebra--the "carotid tubercle"--has been
successfully employed in the treatment of aneurysm near the bifurcation.
proximal ligation in the case of high aneurysms, or distal ligation in
those situated at the root of the neck, is more certain. extirpation of
the sac is probably the best method of treatment, especially in those of
traumatic origin. these operations are attended with considerable risk
of hemiplegia from interference with the blood supply of the brain.

the _external carotid_ and the cervical portion of the _internal
carotid_ are seldom the primary seat of aneurysm, although they are
liable to be implicated by the upward spread of an aneurysm at the
bifurcation of the common trunk. in addition to the ordinary signs of
aneurysm, the clinical manifestations are chiefly referable to pressure
on the pharynx and larynx, and on the hypoglossal nerve. aneurysm of the
internal carotid is of special importance on account of the way in which
it bulges into the pharynx in the region of the tonsil, in some cases
closely simulating a tonsillar abscess. cases are on record in which
such an aneurysm has been mistaken for an abscess and incised, with
disastrous results.

_aneurysmal varix_ may occur in the neck as a result of stabs or bullet
wounds. the communication is usually between the common carotid artery
and the internal jugular vein. the resulting interference with the
cerebral circulation causes headache, giddiness, and other brain
symptoms, and a persistent loud murmur is usually a source of annoyance
to the patient and may be sufficient indication for operative treatment.

#intracranial aneurysm# involves the internal carotid and its branches,
or the basilar artery, and appears to be more frequently associated with
syphilis and with valvular disease of the heart than are external
aneurysms. it gives rise to symptoms similar to those of other
intracranial tumours, and there is sometimes a loud murmur. it usually
proves fatal by rupture, and intracranial haemorrhage. the treatment is
to ligate the common carotid or the vertebral artery in the neck,
according to the seat of the aneurysm.

#orbital aneurysm.#--the term pulsating exophthalmos is employed to
embrace a number of pathological conditions, including aneurysm, in
which the chief symptoms are pulsation in the orbit and protrusion of
the eyeball. there may be, in addition, congestion and oedema of the
eyelids, and a distinct thrill and murmur, which can be controlled by
compression of the common carotid in the neck. varying degrees of ocular
paralysis and of interference with vision may also be present.

these symptoms are due, in the majority of cases, to an aneurysmal varix
of the internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus, which is often
traumatic in origin, being produced either by fracture of the base of
the skull or by a punctured wound of the orbit. in other cases they are
due to aneurysm of the ophthalmic artery, to thrombosis of the cavernous
sinus, and, in rare instances, to cirsoid aneurysm.

if compression of the common carotid is found to arrest the pulsation,
ligation of this vessel is indicated.

#subclavian aneurysm.#--subclavian aneurysm is usually met with in men
who follow occupations involving constant use of the shoulder--for
example, dock-porters and coal-heavers. it is more common on the right
side.

the aneurysm usually springs from the third part of the artery, and
appears as a tense, rounded, pulsatile swelling just above the clavicle
and to the outer side of the sterno-mastoid muscle. it occasionally
extends towards the thorax, where it may become adherent to the pleura.
the radial pulse on the same side is small and delayed. congestion and
oedema of the arm, with pain, numbness, and muscular weakness, may result
from pressure on the veins and nerves as they pass under the clavicle;
and pressure on the phrenic nerve may induce hiccough. the aneurysm is
of slow growth, and occasionally undergoes spontaneous cure.

the conditions most likely to be mistaken for it are a soft, rapidly
growing sarcoma, and a normal artery raised on a cervical rib.

on account of the relations of the artery and of its branches, treatment
is attended with greater difficulty and danger in subclavian than in
almost any other form of external aneurysm. the available operative
measures are proximal ligation of the innominate, and distal ligation.
in some cases it has been found necessary to combine distal ligation
with amputation at the shoulder-joint, to prevent the collateral
circulation maintaining the flow through the aneurysm. matas' operation
has been successfully performed by hogarth pringle.

#axillary aneurysm.#--this is usually met with in the right arm of
labouring men and sailors, and not infrequently follows an injury in the
region of the shoulder. the vessel may be damaged by the head of a
dislocated humerus or in attempts to reduce the dislocation, by the
fragments of a fractured bone, or by a stab or cut. sometimes the vein
also is injured and an arterio-venous aneurysm established.

owing to the laxity of the tissues, it increases rapidly, and it may
soon attain a large size, filling up the axilla, and displacing the
clavicle upwards. this renders compression of the third part of the
subclavian difficult or impossible. it may extend beneath the clavicle
into the neck, or, extending inwards may form adhesions to the chest
wall, and, after eroding the ribs, to the pleura.

the usual symptoms of aneurysm are present, and the pressure effects on
the veins and nerves are similar to those produced by an aneurysm of the
subclavian. intra-thoracic complications, such as pleurisy or pneumonia,
are not infrequent when there are adhesions to the chest wall and
pleura. rupture may take place externally, into the shoulder-joint, or
into the pleura.

extirpation of the sac is the operation of choice, but, if this is
impracticable, ligation of the third part of the subclavian may be had
recourse to.

#brachial aneurysm# usually occurs at the bend of the elbow, is of
traumatic origin, and is best treated by excision of the sac.

_aneurysmal varix_, which was frequently met with in this situation in
the days of the barber-surgeons,--usually as a result of the artery
having been accidentally wounded while performing venesection of the
median basilic vein,--may be treated, according to the amount of
discomfort it causes, by a supporting bandage, or by ligation of the
artery above and below the point of communication.

aneurysms of the vessels of the #forearm and hand# call for no special
mention; they are almost invariably traumatic, and are treated by
excision of the sac.

#inguinal aneurysm# (_aneurysm of the iliac and femoral
arteries_).--aneurysms appearing in the region of poupart's ligament may
have their origin in the external or common iliac arteries or in the
upper part of the femoral. on account of the tension of the fascia lata,
they tend to spread upwards towards the abdomen, and, to a less extent,
downwards into the thigh. sometimes a constriction occurs across the
sac at the level of poupart's ligament.

the pressure exerted on the nerves and veins of the lower extremity
causes pain, congestion, and oedema of the limb. rupture may take place
externally, or into the cellular tissue of the iliac fossa.

these aneurysms have to be diagnosed from pulsating sarcoma growing from
the pelvic bones, and from an abscess or a mass of enlarged lymph glands
overlying the artery and transmitting its pulsation.

the method of treatment that has met with most success is ligation of
the common or external iliac, reached either by reflecting the
peritoneum from off the iliac fossa (extra-peritoneal operation), or by
going through the peritoneal cavity (trans-peritoneal operation).

#gluteal aneurysm.#--an aneurysm in the buttock may arise from the
superior or from the inferior gluteal artery, but by the time it forms a
salient swelling it is seldom possible to recognise by external
examination in which vessel it takes origin. the special symptoms to
which it gives rise are pain down the limb from pressure on the sciatic
nerve, and interference with the movements at the hip.

ligation of the hypogastric (internal iliac) by the trans-peritoneal
route is the most satisfactory method of treatment. extirpation of the
sac is difficult and dangerous, especially when the aneurysm has spread
into the pelvis.

#femoral aneurysm.#--aneurysm of the femoral artery beyond the origin of
the profunda branch is usually traumatic in origin, and is more common
in scarpa's triangle than in hunter's canal. any of the methods already
described is available for their treatment--the choice lying between
matas' operation and ligation of the external iliac.

aneurysm of the _profunda femoris_ is distinguished from that of the
main trunk by the fact that the pulses beyond are, in the former,
unaffected, and by the normal artery being felt pulsating over or
alongside the sac.

in _aneurysmal varix_, a not infrequent result of a bullet wound or a
stab, the communication with the vein may involve the main trunk of the
femoral artery. should operative interference become necessary as a
result of progressive increase in size of the tumour, or progressive
distension of the veins of the limb, an attempt should be made to
separate the vessels concerned and to close the opening in each by
suture. if this is impracticable, the artery is tied above and below the
communication; gangrene of the limb may supervene, and we have observed
a case in which the gangrene extended up to the junction of the middle
and lower thirds of the thigh, and in which recovery followed upon
amputation of the thigh.

#popliteal aneurysm.#--this is the most common surgical aneurysm, and is
not infrequently met with in both limbs. it is generally due to disease
of the artery, and repeated slight strains, which are so liable to occur
at the knee, play an important part in its formation. in former times it
was common in post-boys, from the repeated flexion and extension of the
knee in riding.

the aneurysm is usually of the sacculated variety, and may spring from
the front or from the back of the vessel. it may exert pressure on the
bones and ligaments of the joint, and it has been known to rupture into
the articulation. the pain, stiffness, and effusion into the joint which
accompany these changes often lead to an erroneous diagnosis of joint
disease. the sac may press upon the popliteal artery or vein and their
branches, causing congestion and oedema of the leg, and lead to gangrene.
pressure on the tibial and common peroneal nerves gives rise to severe
pain, muscular cramp, and weakness of the leg.

the differential diagnosis is to be made from abscess, bursal cyst,
enlarged glands, and sarcoma, especially pulsating sarcoma of one of the
bones entering into the knee joint.

the choice of operation lies between ligation of the femoral artery in
hunter's canal, and matas' operation of aneurysmo-arteriorrhaphy. the
success which attends the hunterian operation is evidenced by the fact
that syme performed it thirty-seven times without a single failure. if
it fails, the old operation should be considered, but it is a more
serious operation, and one which is more liable to be followed by
gangrene of the limb. experience shows that ligation of the vein, or
even the removal of a portion of it, is not necessarily followed by
gangrene. the risk of gangrene is diminished by a course of digital
compression of the femoral artery, before operating on the aneurysm.

_aneurysmal varix_ is sometimes met with in the region of the popliteal
space. it is characterised by the usual symptoms, and is treated by
palliative measures, or by ligation of the artery above and below the
point of communication.

_aneurysm_ in the #leg and foot# is rare. it is almost always traumatic,
and is treated by excision of the sac.

the lymph vessels and glands


anatomy and physiology--injuries of lymph vessels--_wounds of
    thoracic duct_--diseases of lymph vessels--lymphangitis:
    _varieties_--lymphangiectasis--filarial
    disease--lymphangioma--diseases of lymph
    glands--lymphadenitis: _septic_; _tuberculous_;
    _syphilitic_--lymphadenoma--leucocythaemia--tumours.

#surgical anatomy and physiology.#--lymph is essentially blood plasma,
which has passed through the walls of capillaries. after bathing
and nourishing the tissues, it is collected by lymph vessels, which
return it to the blood stream by way of the thoracic duct. these lymph
vessels take origin in the lymph spaces of the tissues and in the
walls of serous cavities, and they usually run alongside blood
vessels--_perivascular lymph vessels_. they have a structure similar to
that of veins, but are more abundantly provided with valves. along the
course of the lymph trunks are the _lymph glands_, which possess a
definite capsule and are composed of a reticulated connective tissue,
the spaces of which are packed with leucocytes. the glands act as
filters, arresting not only inert substances, such as blood pigment
circulating in the lymph, but also living elements, such as cancer cells
or bacteria. as it passes through a gland the lymph is brought into
intimate contact with the leucocytes, and in bacterial infections there
is always a struggle between the organisms and the leucocytes, so that
the glands may be looked upon as an important line of defence, retarding
or preventing the passage of bacteria and their products into the
general circulation. the infective agent, moreover, in order to reach
the blood stream, must usually overcome the resistance of several
glands.

lymph glands are, for the most part, arranged in groups or chains, such
as those in the axilla, neck, and groin. in any given situation they
vary in number and size in different individuals, and fresh glands may
be formed on comparatively slight stimulus, and disappear when the
stimulus is withdrawn. the best-known example of this is the increase in
the number of glands in the axilla which takes place during lactation;
when this function ceases, many of the glands become involuted and are
transformed into fat, and in the event of a subsequent lactation they
are again developed. after glands have been removed by operation, new
ones may be formed.

the following are the more important groups of glands, and the areas
drained by them in the head and neck and in the extremities.

#head and neck.#--_the anterior auricular (parotid and pre-auricular)
glands_ lie beneath the parotid fascia in front of the ear, and some
are partly embedded in the substance of the parotid gland; they drain
the parts about the temple, cheek, eyelids, and auricle, and are
frequently the seat of tuberculous disease. _the occipital gland_,
situated over the origin of the trapezius from the superior curved line,
drains the top and back of the head; it is rarely infected. _the
posterior auricular (mastoid) glands_ lie over the mastoid process, and
drain the side of the head and auricle. these three groups pour their
lymph into the superficial cervical glands. _the submaxillary_--two to
six in number--lie along the lower order of the mandible from the
symphysis to the angle, the posterior ones (paramandibular) being
closely connected with the submaxillary salivary gland. they receive
lymph from the face, lips, floor of the mouth, gums, teeth, anterior
part of tongue, and the alae nasi, and from the pre-auricular glands. the
lymph passes from them into the deeper cervical glands. they are
frequently infected with tubercle, with epithelioma which has spread to
them from the mouth, and also with pyogenic organisms. _the submental
glands_ lie in or close to the median line between the anterior bellies
of the digastric muscles, and receive lymph from the lips. it is rare
for them to be the seat of tubercle, but in epithelioma of the lower lip
and floor of the mouth they are infected at an early stage of the
disease. _the supra-hyoid gland_ lies a little farther back, immediately
above the hyoid bone, and receives lymph from the tongue. _the
superficial cervical (external jugular) glands_, when present, lie along
the external jugular vein, and receives lymph from the occipital and
auricular glands and from the auricle. _the sterno-mastoid
glands_--glandulae concatinatae--form a chain along the posterior edge of
the sterno-mastoid muscle, some of them lying beneath the muscle. they
are commonly enlarged in secondary syphilis. _the superior deep cervical
(internal jugular) glands_--from six to twenty in number--form a
continuous chain along the internal jugular vein, beneath the
sterno-mastoid muscle. they drain the various groups of glands which lie
nearer the surface, also the interior of the skull, the larynx, trachea,
thyreoid, and lower part of the pharynx, and pour their lymph into the
main trunks at the root of the neck. belonging to this group is one
large gland (the tonsillar gland) which lies behind the posterior belly
of the digastric, and rests in the angle between the internal jugular
and common facial veins. it is commonly enlarged in affections of the
tonsil and posterior part of the tongue. in the same group are three or
four glands which lie entirely under cover of the upper end of the
sterno-mastoid muscle, and surround the accessory nerve before it
perforates the muscle. the deep cervical glands are commonly infected by
tubercle and also by epithelioma secondary to disease in the tongue or
throat. _the inferior deep cervical (supra-clavicular) glands_ lie in
the posterior triangle, above the clavicle. they receive lymph from the
lowest cervical glands, from the upper part of the chest wall, and from
the highest axillary glands. they are frequently infected in cancer of
the breast; those on the left side also in cancer of the stomach. the
removal of diseased supra-clavicular glands is not to be lightly
undertaken, as difficulties are liable to ensue in connection with the
thoracic duct, the pleura, or the junction of the subclavian and
internal jugular veins. _the retro-pharyngeal glands_ lie on each side
of the median line upon the rectus capitis anticus major muscle and in
front of the pre-vertebral layer of the cervical fascia. they receive
part of the lymph from the posterior wall of the pharynx, the interior
of the nose and its accessory cavities, the auditory (eustachian) tube,
and the tympanum. when they are infected with pyogenic organisms or
with tubercle bacilli, they may lead to the formation of one form of
retro-pharyngeal abscess.

#upper extremity.#--_the epi-trochlear and cubital glands_ vary in
number, that most commonly present lying about an inch and a half above
the medial epi-condyle, and other and smaller glands may lie along the
medial (internal) bicipital groove or at the bend of the elbow. they
drain the ulnar side of the hand and forearm, and pour their lymph into
the axillary group. the epi-trochlear gland is sometimes enlarged in
syphilis. _the axillary glands_ are arranged in groups: a central group
lies embedded in the axillary fascia and fat, and is often related to an
opening in it; a posterior or subscapular group lies along the line of
the subscapular vessels; anterior or pectoral groups lie behind the
pectoralis minor, along the medial side of the axillary vein, and an
inter-pectoral group, between the two pectoral muscles. the axillary
glands receive lymph from the arm, mamma, and side of the chest, and
pass it on into the lowest cervical glands and the main lymph trunk.
they are frequently the seat of pyogenic, tuberculous, and cancerous
infection, and their complete removal is an essential part of the
operation for cancer of the breast.

#lower extremity.#--_the popliteal glands_ include one superficial gland
at the termination of the small saphenous vein, and several deeper ones
in relation to the popliteal vessels. they receive lymph from the toes
and foot, and transmit it to the inguinal glands. _the femoral glands_
lie vertically along the upper part of the great saphenous vein, and
receive lymph from the leg and foot; from them the lymph passes to the
deep inguinal and external iliac glands. the femoral glands often
participate in pyogenic infections entering through the skin of the toes
and sole of the foot. _the superficial inguinal glands_ lie along the
inguinal (poupart's) ligament, and receive lymph from the external
genitals, anus, perineum, buttock, and anterior abdominal wall. the
lymph passes on to the deep inguinal and external iliac glands. the
superficial glands through their relations to the genitals are
frequently the subject of venereal infection, and also of epithelioma
when this disease affects the genitals or anus; they are rarely the seat
of tuberculosis. _the deep inguinal glands_ lie on the medial side of
the femoral vein, and sometimes within the femoral canal. they receive
lymph from the deep lymphatics of the lower limb, and some of the
efferent vessels from the femoral and superficial inguinal glands. the
lymph then passes on through the femoral canal to the external iliac
glands. the extension of malignant disease, whether cancer or sarcoma,
can often be traced along these deeper lymphatics into the pelvis, and
as the obstruction to the flow of lymph increases there is a
corresponding increase in the swollen dropsical condition of the lower
limb on the same side.

the glands of the _thorax_ and _abdomen_ will be considered with the
surgery of these regions.


injuries of lymph vessels

lymph vessels are divided in all wounds, and the lymph that escapes from
them is added to any discharge that may be present. in injuries of
larger trunks the lymph may escape in considerable quantity as a
colourless, watery fluid--_lymphorrhagia_; and the opening through which
it escapes is known as a _lymphatic fistula_. this has been observed
chiefly after extensive operation for the removal of malignant glands in
the groin where there already exists a considerable degree of
obstruction to the lymph stream, and in such cases the lymph, including
that which has accumulated in the vessels of the limb, may escape in
such abundance as to soak through large dressings and delay healing.
ultimately new lymph channels are formed, so that at the end of from
four to six weeks the discharge of lymph ceases and the wound heals.

_lymphatic oedema._--when the lymphatic return from a limb has been
seriously interfered with,--as, for example, when the axillary contents
has been completely cleared out in operating for cancer of the
breast,--a condition of lymphatic oedema may result, the arm becoming
swollen, tight, and heavy.

various degrees of the conditions are met with; in the severe forms,
there is pain, as well as incapacity of the limb. as in ordinary oedema,
the condition is relieved by elevation of the limb, but not nearly to
the same degree; in time the tissues become so hard and tense as
scarcely to pit on pressure; this is in part due to the formation of new
connective tissue and hypertrophy of the skin; in advanced cases there
is a gradual transition into one form of elephantiasis.

handley has devised a method of treatment--_lymphangioplasty_--the
object of which is to drain the lymph by embedding a number of silk
threads in the subcutaneous cellular tissue.

#wounds of the thoracic duct.#--the thoracic duct usually opens at the
angle formed by the junction of the left internal jugular and subclavian
veins, but it may open into either of these vessels by one or by several
channels, or the duct may be double throughout its course. there is a
smaller duct on the right side--the right lymphatic duct. the duct or
ducts may be displaced by a tumour or a mass of enlarged glands, and may
be accidentally wounded in dissections at the root of the neck; jets of
milky fluid--chyle--may at once escape from it. the jets are rhythmical
and coincide with expiration. the injury may, however, not be observed
at the time of operation, but later through the dressings being soaked
with chyle--_chylorrhoea_. if the wound involves the only existing main
duct and all the chyle escapes, the patient suffers from intense thirst,
emaciation, and weakness, and may die of inanition; but if, as is
usually the case, only one of several collateral channels is implicated,
the loss of chyle may be of little moment, as the discharge usually
ceases. if the wound heals so that the chyle is prevented from escaping,
a fluctuating swelling may form beneath the scar; in course of time it
gradually disappears.

an attempt should be made to close the wound in the duct by means of a
fine suture; failing this, the duct must be occluded by a ligature as if
it were a bleeding artery. the tissues are then stitched over it and the
skin wound accurately closed, so as to obtain primary union, firm
pressure being applied by dressings and an elastic webbing bandage. even
if the main duct is obliterated, a collateral circulation is usually
established. a wound of the right lymphatic duct is of less importance.

_subcutaneous rupture of the thoracic duct_ may result from a crush of
the thorax. the chyle escapes and accumulates in the cellular tissue of
the posterior mediastinum, behind the peritoneum, in the pleural cavity
(_chylo-thorax_), or in the peritoneal cavity (_chylous ascites_). there
are physical signs of fluid in one or other of these situations, but, as
a rule, the nature of the lesion is only recognised when chyle is
withdrawn by the exploring needle.


diseases of lymph vessels

#lymphangitis.#--inflammation of peripheral lymph vessels usually
results from some primary source of pyogenic infection in the skin. this
may be a wound or a purulent blister, and the streptococcus pyogenes is
the organism most frequently present. _septic_ lymphangitis is commonly
met with in those who, from the nature of their occupation, handle
infective material. a _gonococcal_ form has been observed in those
suffering from gonorrhoea.

the inflammation affects chiefly the walls of the vessels, and is
attended with clotting of the lymph. there is also some degree of
inflammation of the surrounding cellular tissue--_peri-lymphangitis_.
one or more abscesses may form along the course of the vessels, or a
spreading cellulitis may supervene.

the _clinical features_ resemble those of other pyogenic infections, and
there are wavy red lines running from the source of infection towards
the nearest lymph glands. these correspond to the inflamed vessels, and
are the seat of burning pain and tenderness. the associated glands are
enlarged and painful. in severe cases the symptoms merge into those of
septicaemia. when the deep lymph vessels alone are involved, the
superficial red lines are absent, but the limb becomes greatly swollen
and pits on pressure.

in cases of extensive lymphangitis, especially when there are repeated
attacks, the vessels are obliterated by the formation of new connective
tissue and a persistent solid oedema results, culminating in one form of
elephantiasis.

_treatment._--the primary source of infection is dealt with on the usual
lines. if the lymphangitis affects an extremity, bier's elastic bandage
is applied, and if suppuration occurs, the pus is let out through one or
more small incisions; in other parts of the body klapp's suction bells
are employed. an autogenous vaccine may be prepared and injected. when
the condition has subsided, the limb is massaged and evenly bandaged to
promote the disappearance of oedema.

_tuberculous lymphangitis._--although lymph vessels play an important
role in the spread of tuberculosis, the clinical recognition of the
disease in them is exceptional. the infection spreads upwards along the
superficial lymphatics, which become nodularly thickened; at one or more
points, larger, peri-lymphangitic nodules may form and break down into
abscesses and ulcers; the nearest group of glands become infected at an
early stage. when the disease is widely distributed throughout the
lymphatics of the limb, it becomes swollen and hard--a condition
illustrated by lupus elephantiasis.

_syphilitic lymphangitis_ is observed in cases of primary syphilis, in
which the vessels of the dorsum of the penis can be felt as indurated
cords.

in addition to acting as channels for the conveyance of bacterial
infection, _lymph vessels frequently convey the cells of malignant
tumours_, and especially cancer, from the seat of the primary disease to
the nearest lymph glands, and they may themselves become the seat of
cancerous growth forming nodular cords. the permeation of cancer by way
of the lymphatics, described by sampson handley, has already been
referred to.

#lymphangiectasis# is a dilated or varicose condition of lymph vessels.
it is met with as a congenital affection in the tongue and lips, or it
may be acquired as the result of any condition which is attended with
extensive obliteration or blocking of the main lymph trunks. an
interesting type of lymphangiectasis is that which results from the
presence of the _filaria bancrofti_ in the vessels, and is observed
chiefly in the groin, spermatic cord, and scrotum of persons who have
lived in the tropics.

_filarial disease in the lymphatics of the groin_ appears as a soft,
doughy swelling, varying in size from a walnut to a cocoa-nut; it may
partly disappear on pressure and when the patient lies down.

the patient gives a history of feverish attacks of the nature of
lymphangitis during which the swelling becomes painful and tender. these
attacks may show a remarkable periodicity, and each may be followed by
an increase in the size of the swelling, which may extend along the
inguinal canal into the abdomen, or down the spermatic cord into the
scrotum. on dissection, the swelling is found to be made up of dilated,
tortuous, and thickened lymph vessels in which the parent worm is
sometimes found, and of greatly enlarged lymph glands which have
undergone fibrosis, with giant-cell formation and eosinophile
aggregations. the fluid in the dilated vessels is either clear or
turbid, in the latter case resembling chyle. the affection is frequently
bilateral, and may be associated with lymph scrotum, with elephantiasis,
and with chyluria.

the _diagnosis_ is to be made from such other swellings in the groin as
hernia, lipoma, or cystic pouching of the great saphenous vein. it is
confirmed by finding the recently dead or dying worms in the inflamed
lymph glands.

_treatment._--when the disease is limited to the groin or scrotum,
excision may bring about a permanent cure, but it may result in the
formation of lymphatic sinuses and only afford temporary relief.

#lymphangioma.#--a lymphangioma is a swelling composed of a series of
cavities and channels filled with lymph and freely communicating with
one another. the cavities result either from the new formation of lymph
spaces or vessels, or from the dilatation of those which already exist;
their walls are composed of fibro-areolar tissue lined by endothelium
and strengthened by non-striped muscle. they are rarely provided with a
definite capsule, and frequently send prolongations of their substance
between and into muscles and other structures in their vicinity. they
are of congenital origin and usually make their appearance at or shortly
after birth. when the tumour is made up of a meshwork of caverns and
channels, it is called a _cavernous lymphangioma_; when it is composed
of one or more cysts, it is called a _cystic lymphangioma_. it is
probable that the cysts are derived from the caverns by breaking down
and absorption of the intervening septa, as transition forms between the
cavernous and cystic varieties are sometimes met with.

the _cavernous lymphangioma_ appears as an ill-defined, soft swelling,
presenting many of the characters of a subcutaneous haemangioma, but it
is not capable of being emptied by pressure, it does not become tense
when the blood pressure is raised, as in crying, and if the tumour is
punctured, it yields lymph instead of blood. it also resembles a lipoma,
especially the congenital variety which grows from the periosteum, and
the differential diagnosis between these is rarely completed until the
swelling is punctured or explored by operation. if treatment is called
for, it is carried out on the same lines as for haemangioma, by means of
electrolysis, igni-puncture, or excision. complete excision is rarely
possible because of the want of definition and encapsulation, but it is
not necessary for cure, as the parts that remain undergo cicatrisation.

[illustration: fig. 76.--congenital cystic tumour or hygroma of axilla.

(from a photograph lent by dr. lediard.)]

the _cystic lymphangioma_, _lymphatic cyst_, or _congenital cystic
hygroma_ is most often met with in the neck--_hydrocele of the neck_; it
is situated beneath the deep fascia, and projects either in front of or
behind the sterno-mastoid muscle. it may attain a large size, the
overlying skin and cyst wall may be so thin as to be translucent, and it
has been known to cause serious impairment of respiration through
pressing on the trachea. in the axilla also the cystic tumour may attain
a considerable size (fig. 76); less frequent situations are the groin,
and the floor of the mouth, where it constitutes one form of ranula.

the nature of these swellings is to be recognised by their situation, by
their having existed from infancy, and, if necessary, by drawing off
some of the contents of the cyst through a fine needle. they are usually
remarkably indolent, persisting often for a long term of years without
change, and, like the haemangioma, they sometimes undergo spontaneous
cicatrisation and cure. sometimes the cystic tumour becomes infected and
forms an abscess--another, although less desirable, method of cure.
those situated in the neck are most liable to suppurate, probably
because of pyogenic organisms being brought to them by the lymphatics
taking origin in the scalp, ear, or throat.

if operative interference is called for, the cysts may be tapped and
injected with iodine, or excised; the operation for removal may entail a
considerable dissection amongst the deeper structures at the root of the
neck, and should not be lightly undertaken; parts left behind may be
induced to cicatrise by inserting a tube of radium and leaving it for a
few days.

lymphangiomas are met with in the abdomen in the form of _omental
cysts_.


diseases of lymph glands

#lymphadenitis.#--inflammation of lymph glands results from the advent
of an irritant, usually bacterial or toxic, brought to the glands by the
afferent lymph vessels. these vessels may share in the inflammation and
be the seat of lymphangitis, or they may show no evidence of the passage
of the noxa. it is exceptional for the irritant to reach the gland
through the blood-stream.

a strain or other form of trauma is sometimes blamed for the onset of
lymphadenitis, especially in the glands of the groin (bubo), but it is
usually possible to discover some source of pyogenic infection which is
responsible for the mischief, or to obtain a history of some antecedent
infection such as gonorrhoea. it is possible for gonococci to lie latent
in the inguinal glands for long periods, and only give rise to
lymphadenitis if the glands be subsequently subjected to injury. the
glands most frequently affected are those in the neck, axilla, and
groin.

the characters of the lymphadenitis vary with the nature of the
irritant. sometimes it is mild and evanescent, as in the glandular
enlargement in the neck which attends tonsillitis and other forms of
sore throat. sometimes it is more persistent, as in the enlargement
that is associated with adenoids, hypertrophied tonsils, carious teeth,
eczema of the scalp, and otorrhoea; and it is possible that this indolent
enlargement predisposes to tuberculous infection. a similar enlargement
is met with in the axilla in cases of chronic interstitial mastitis, and
in the groin as a result of chronic irritation about the external
genitals, such as balanitis.

sometimes the lymphadenitis is of an acute character, and the tendency
is towards the formation of an abscess. this is illustrated in the
axillary glands as a result of infected wounds of the fingers; in the
femoral glands in infected wounds or purulent blisters on the foot; in
the inguinal glands in gonorrhoea and soft sore; and in the cervical
glands in the severer forms of sore throat associated with diphtheria
and scarlet fever. the most acute suppurations result from infection
with streptococci.

superficial glands, when inflamed and suppurating, become enlarged,
tender, fixed, and matted to one another. in the glands of the groin the
suppurative process is often remarkably sluggish; purulent foci form in
the interior of individual glands, and some time may elapse before the
pus erupts through their respective capsules. in the deeply placed
cervical glands, especially in cases of streptococcal throat infections,
the suppuration rapidly involves the surrounding cellular tissue, and
the clinical features are those of an acute cellulitis and deeply seated
abscess. when this is incised the necrosed glands may be found lying in
the pus, and on bacteriological examination are found to be swarming
with streptococci. in suppuration of the axillary glands the abscess may
be quite superficial, or it may be deeply placed beneath the strong
fascia and pectoral muscles, according to the group of glands involved.

the _diagnosis_ of septic lymphadenitis is usually easy. the indolent
enlargements are not always to be distinguished, however, from
commencing tuberculous disease, except by the use of the tuberculin
test, and by the fact that they usually disappear on removing the
peripheral source of irritation.

_treatment._--the first indication is to discover and deal with the
source of infection, and in the indolent forms of lymphadenitis this
will usually be followed by recovery. in the acute forms following on
pyogenic infection, the best results are obtained from the hyperaemic
treatment carried out by means of suction bells. if suppuration is not
thereby prevented, or if it has already taken place, each separate
collection of pus is punctured with a narrow-bladed knife and the use of
the suction bell is persevered with. if there is a large periglandular
abscess, as is often the case, in the neck and axilla, the opening may
require to be made by hilton's method, and it may be necessary to insert
a drainage-tube.

[illustration: fig. 77.--tuberculous cervical gland with abscess
formation in subcutaneous cellular tissue, in a boy aet. 10.]

#tuberculous disease of glands.#--this is a disease of great frequency
and importance. the tubercle bacilli usually gain access to the gland
through the afferent lymph vessels, which convey them from some lesion
of the surface within the area drained by them. tuberculous infection
may supervene in glands that are already enlarged as a result of chronic
septic irritation. while any of the glands in the body may be affected,
the disease is most often met with in the cervical groups which derive
their lymph from the mouth, nose, throat, and ear.

_the appearance of the glands on section_ varies with the stage of the
disease. in the early stages the gland is enlarged, it may be to many
times its natural size, is normal in appearance and consistence, and as
there is no peri-adenitis it is easily shelled out from its
surroundings. on microscopical examination, however, there is evidence
of infection in the shape of bacilli and of characteristic giant and
epithelioid cells. at a later stage, the gland tissue is studded with
minute yellow foci which tend to enlarge and in time to become
confluent, so that the whole gland is ultimately converted into a
caseous mass. this caseous material is surrounded by the thickened
capsule which, as a result of peri-adenitis, tends to become adherent to
and fused with surrounding structures, and particularly with layers of
fascia and with the walls of veins. the caseated tissue often remains
unchanged for long periods; it may become calcified, but more frequently
it breaks down and liquefies.

#tuberculous disease in the cervical glands# is a common accompaniment
or sequel of adenoids, enlarged tonsils, carious teeth, pharyngitis,
middle-ear disease, and conjunctivitis. these lesions afford the bacilli
a chance of entry into the lymph vessels, in which they are carried to
the glands, where they give rise to disease.

the enlargement may affect only one gland, usually below the angle of
the mandible, and remain confined to it, the gland reaching the size of
a hazel-nut, and being ovoid, firm, and painless. more commonly the
disease affects several glands, on one or on both sides of the neck.
when the disease commences in the pre-auricular or submaxillary glands,
it tends to spread to those along the carotid sheath: when the posterior
auricular and occipital glands are first involved, the spread is to
those along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid. in many cases
all the chains in front of, beneath, and behind this muscle are
involved, the enlarged glands extending from the mastoid to the
clavicle. they are at first discrete and movable, and may even vary in
size from time to time; but with the addition of peri-adenitis they
become fixed and matted together, forming lobulated or nodular masses
(fig. 78). they become adherent not only to one another, but also to the
structures in their vicinity,--and notably to the internal jugular
vein,--a point of importance in regard to their removal by operation.

at any stage the disease may be arrested and the glands remain for long
periods without further change. it is possible that the tuberculous
tissue may undergo cicatrisation. more commonly suppuration ensues, and
a cold abscess forms, but if there is a mixed infection, the pyogenic
factor being usually derived from the throat, it may take on active
features.

[illustration: fig. 78.--mass of tuberculous glands removed from axilla
(cf. fig. 79).]

the transition from the solid to the liquefied stage is attended with
pain and tenderness in the gland, which at the same time becomes fixed
and globular, and finally fluctuation can be elicited.

if left to itself, the softened tubercle erupts through the capsule of
the gland and infects the cellular tissue. the cervical fascia is
perforated and a cold abscess, often much larger than the gland from
which it took origin, forms between the fascia and the overlying skin.
the further stages--reddening, undermining of skin and external rupture,
with the formation of ulcers and sinuses--have been described with
tuberculous abscess. the ulcers and sinuses persist indefinitely, or
they heal and then break out again; sometimes the skin becomes infected,
and a condition like lupus spreads over a considerable area. spontaneous
healing finally takes place after the caseous tubercle has been
extruded; the resulting scars are extremely unsightly, being puckered or
bridled, or hypertrophied like keloid.

while the disease is most common in childhood and youth, it may be met
with even in advanced life; and although often associated with impaired
health and unhealthy surroundings, it may affect those who are
apparently robust and are in affluent circumstances.

_diagnosis._--the chief importance lies in differentiating tuberculous
disease from lympho-sarcoma and from lymphadenoma, and this is usually
possible from the history and from the nature of the enlargement. signs
of liquefaction and suppuration support the diagnosis of tubercle. if
any doubt remains, one of the glands should be removed and submitted to
microscopical examination. other forms of sarcoma, and the enlargement
of an accessory thyreoid, are less likely to be confused with
tuberculous glands. calcified tuberculous glands give definite shadows
with the x-rays.

enlargement of the cervical glands from secondary cancer may simulate
tuberculosis, but is differentiated by its association with cancer in
the mouth or throat, and by the characteristic, stone-like induration of
epithelioma.

the cold abscess which results from tuberculous glands is to be
distinguished from that due to disease in the cervical spine,
retro-pharyngeal abscess, as well as from congenital and other cystic
swellings in the neck.

_prognosis._--next to lupus, glandular disease is of all tuberculous
lesions the least dangerous to life; but while it is the rule to recover
from tuberculous disease of glands with or without an operation, it is
unfortunately quite common for such persons to become the subjects of
tuberculosis in other parts of the body at any subsequent period of
life.

_treatment._--there is considerable difference of opinion regarding the
treatment of glandular tuberculosis. some authorities, impressed with
the undoubted possibility of natural cure, are satisfied with promoting
this by measures directed towards improving the general health, by the
prolonged administration of tuberculin, and by repeated exposures to the
x-rays and to sunlight. others again, influenced by the risk of
extension of the disease and by the destruction of tissue and
disfigurement caused by breaking down of the tuberculous tissue and
mixed infection, advocate the removal of the glands by operation.

the conditions vary widely in different cases, and the treatment should
be adapted to the individual requirements. if the disease remains
confined to the glands originally infected and there are no signs of
breaking down, "expectant measures" may be persevered with.

[illustration: fig. 79.--tuberculous axillary glands (cf. fig. 78).]

if, on the other hand, the disease exhibits aggressive tendencies, the
question of operation should be considered. the undesirable results of
the breaking down and liquefaction of the diseased gland may be avoided
by the timely withdrawal of the fluid contents through a hollow needle.

_the excision of tuberculous glands_ is often a difficult operation,
because of the number and deep situation of the glands to be removed,
and of the adhesions to surrounding structures. the skin incision must
be sufficiently extensive to give access to the whole of the affected
area, and to avoid disfigurement should, whenever possible, be made in
the line of the natural creases of the skin. in exposing the glands the
common facial and other venous trunks may require to be clamped and
tied. care must be taken not to injure the important nerves,
particularly the accessory, the vagus, and the phrenic. the
inframaxillary branches of the facial, the hypoglossal and its
descending branches, and the motor branches of the deep cervical plexus,
are also liable to be injured. the dissection is rendered easier and is
attended with less risk of injury to the nerves, if the patient is
placed in the sitting posture so as to empty the veins, and, instead of
a knife, the conical scissors of mayo are employed. when the glands are
extensively affected on both sides of the neck, it is advisable to allow
an interval to elapse rather than to operate on both sides at one
sitting. (_op. surg._, p. 189.)

if the tonsils are enlarged they should not be removed at the same time,
as, by so doing, there is a risk of pyogenic infection from the throat
being carried to the wound in the neck, but they should be removed,
after an interval, to prevent relapse of disease in the glands.

_when the skin is broken_ and caseous tuberculous tissue is exposed,
healing is promoted by cutting away diseased skin, removing the
granulation tissue with the spoon, scraping sinuses, and packing the
cavity with iodoform worsted and treating it by the open method and
secondary suture if necessary. exposure to the sunshine on the seashore
and to the x-rays is often beneficial in these cases.

#tuberculous disease in the axillary glands# may be a result of
extension from those in the neck, from the mamma, ribs, or sternum, or
more rarely from the upper extremity. we have seen it from an infected
wound of a finger. in some cases no source of infection is discoverable.
the individual glands attain a considerable size, and they fuse together
to form a large tumour which fills up the axillary space. the disease
progresses more rapidly than it does in the cervical glands, and almost
always goes on to suppuration with the formation of sinuses.
conservative measures need not be considered, as the only satisfactory
treatment is excision, and that without delay.

#tuberculous disease in the glands of the groin# is comparatively rare.
we have chiefly observed it in the femoral glands as a result of
inoculation tubercle on the toes or sole of the foot. the affected
glands nearly always break down and suppurate, and after destroying the
overlying skin give rise to fungating ulcers. the treatment consists in
excising the glands and the affected skin. the dissection may be
attended with troublesome haemorrhage from the numerous veins that
converge towards the femoral trunk.

tuberculous disease in the _mesenteric_ and _bronchial glands_ is
described with the surgery of regions.

#syphilitic disease of glands.#--enlargement of lymph glands is a
prominent feature of acquired syphilis, especially in the form of the
indolent or bullet-bubo which accompanies the primary lesion, and the
general enlargement of glands that occurs in secondary syphilis.
gummatous disease in glands is extremely rare; the affected gland
rapidly enlarges to the size of a walnut, and may then persist for a
long period without further change; if it breaks down, the overlying
skin is destroyed and the caseated tissue of the gumma exposed.

#lymphadenoma.#--_hodgkin's disease_ (pseudo-leukaemia of german
authors).--this is a rare disease, the origin of which is as yet
unknown, but analogy would suggest that it is due to infection with a
slowly growing micro-organism. it is chiefly met with in young subjects,
and is characterised by a painless enlargement of a particular group of
glands, most commonly those in the cervical region (fig. 80).

[illustration: fig. 80.--chronic hodgkin's disease in a boy aet. 11.]

the glands are usually larger than in tuberculosis, and they remain
longer discrete and movable; they are firm in consistence, and on
section present a granular appearance due to overgrowth of the
connective-tissue framework. in time the glandular masses may form
enormous projecting tumours, the swelling being added to by lymphatic
oedema of the overlying cellular tissue and skin.

the enlargement spreads along the chain of glands to those above the
clavicle, to those in the axilla, and to those of the opposite side
(fig. 81). later, the glands in the groin become enlarged, and it is
probable that the infection has spread from the neck along the
mediastinal, bronchial, retro-peritoneal, and mesenteric glands, and has
branched off to the iliac and inguinal groups.

two clinical types are recognised, one in which the disease progresses
slowly and remains confined to the cervical glands for two or more
years; the other, in which the disease is more rapidly disseminated and
causes death in from twelve to eighteen months.

[illustration: fig. 81.--lymphadenoma (hodgkin's disease) affecting left
side of neck and left axilla, in a woman aet. 44. three years' duration.]

in the acute form, the health suffers, there is fever, and the glands
may vary in size with variations in the temperature; the blood presents
the characters met with in secondary anaemia. the spleen, liver, testes,
and mammae may be enlarged; the glandular swellings press on important
structures, such as the trachea, oesophagus, or great veins, and symptoms
referable to such pressure manifest themselves.

_diagnosis._--considerable difficulty attends the diagnosis of
lymphadenoma at an early stage. the negative results of tuberculin tests
may assist in the differentiation from tuberculous disease, but the more
certain means of excising one of the suspected glands and submitting it
to microscopical examination should be had recourse to. the sections
show proliferation of endothelial cells, the formation of numerous giant
cells quite unlike those of tuberculosis and a progressive fibrosis.
lympho-sarcoma can usually be differentiated by the rapid assumption of
the local features of malignant disease, and in a gland removed for
examination, a predominance of small round cells with scanty protoplasm.
the enlargement associated with leucocythaemia is differentiated by the
characteristic changes in the blood.

_treatment._--in the acute form of lymphadenoma, treatment is of little
avail. arsenic may be given in full doses either by the mouth or by
subcutaneous injection; the intravenous administration of neo-salvarsan
may be tried. exposure to the x-rays and to radium has been more
successful than any other form of treatment. excision of glands,
although sometimes beneficial, seldom arrests the progress of the
disease. the ease and rapidity with which large masses of glands may be
shelled out is in remarkable contrast to what is observed in tuberculous
disease. surgical interference may give relief when important structures
are being pressed upon--tracheotomy, for example, may be required where
life is threatened by asphyxia.

#leucocythaemia.#--this is a disease of the blood and of the
blood-forming organs, in which there is a great increase in the number,
and an alteration of the character, of the leucocytes present in the
blood. it may simulate lymphadenoma, because, in certain forms of the
disease, the lymph glands, especially those in the neck, axilla, and
groin, are greatly enlarged.


tumours of lymph glands

#primary tumours.#--_lympho-sarcoma_, which may be regarded as a sarcoma
starting in a lymph gland, appears in the neck, axilla, or groin as a
rapidly growing tumour consisting of one enlarged gland with numerous
satellites. as the tumour increases in size, the sarcomatous tissue
erupts through the capsule of the gland, and infiltrates the surrounding
tissues, whereby it becomes fixed to these and to the skin.

[illustration: fig. 82.--lympho-sarcoma removed from groin. it will be
observed that there is one large central parent tumour surrounded by
satellites.]

the prognosis is grave in the extreme, and the only hope is in early
excision, followed by the use of radium and x-rays. we have observed a
case of lympho-sarcoma above the clavicle, in which excision of all that
was removable, followed by the insertion of a tube of radium for ten
days, was followed by a disappearance of the disease over a period which
extended to nearly five years, when death resulted from a tumour in the
mediastinum. in a second case in which the growth was in the groin, the
patient, a young man, remained well for over two years and was then lost
sight of.

#secondary tumours.#--next to tuberculosis, _secondary cancer_ is the
most common disease of lymph glands. in the neck it is met with in
association with epithelioma of the lip, tongue, or fauces. the glands
form tumours of variable size, and are often larger than the primary
growth, the characters of which they reproduce. the glands are at first
movable, but soon become fixed both to each other and to their
surroundings; when fixed to the mandible they form a swelling of
bone-like hardness; in time they soften, liquefy, and burst through the
skin, forming foul, fungating ulcers. a similar condition is met with in
the groin from epithelioma of the penis, scrotum, or vulva. in cancer of
the breast, the infection of the axillary glands is an important
complication.

in _pigmented_ or _melanotic cancers_ of the skin, the glands are early
infected and increase rapidly, so that, when the primary growth is still
of small size--as, for example, on the sole of the foot--the femoral
glands may already constitute large pigmented tumours.

[illustration: fig. 83.--cancerous glands in neck secondary to
epithelioma of lip.

(mr. g. l. chiene's case.)]

the implication of the glands in other forms of cancer will be
considered with regional surgery.

_secondary sarcoma_ is seldom met with in the lymph glands except when
the primary growth is a lympho-sarcoma and is situated in the tonsil,
thyreoid, or testicle.




chapter xvi

the nerves


anatomy--injuries of nerves: changes in nerves after division;
    repair and its modifications; clinical features; _primary and
    secondary suture_--subcutaneous injuries of
    nerves--diseases: _neuritis_; _tumours_--surgery of
    the individual nerves: _brachial neuralgia_; _sciatica_;
    _trigeminal neuralgia_.

#anatomy.#--a nerve-trunk is made up of a variable number of bundles of
nerve fibres surrounded and supported by a framework of connective
tissue. the nerve fibres are chiefly of the medullated type, and they
run without interruption from a nerve cell or _neuron_ in the brain or
spinal medulla to their peripheral terminations in muscle, skin, and
secretory glands.

each nerve fibre consists of a number of nerve fibrils collected into a
central bundle--the axis cylinder--which is surrounded by an envelope,
the neurolemma or sheath of schwann. between the neurolemma and the axis
cylinder is the medullated sheath, composed of a fatty substance known
as myelin. this medullated sheath is interrupted at the nodes of
ranvier, and in each internode is a nucleus lying between the myelin and
the neurolemma. the axis cylinder is the essential conducting structure
of the nerve, while the neurolemma and the myelin act as insulating
agents. the axis cylinder depends for its nutrition on the central
neuron with which it is connected, and from which it originally
developed, and it degenerates if it is separated from its neuron.

the connective-tissue framework of a nerve-trunk consists of the
_perineurium_, or general sheath, which surrounds all the bundles; the
_epineurium_, surrounding individual groups of bundles; and the
_endoneurium_, a delicate connective tissue separating the individual
nerve fibres. the blood vessels and lymphatics run in these
connective-tissue sheaths.

according to head and his co-workers, sherren and rivers, the afferent
fibres in the peripheral nerves can be divided into three systems:--

1. those which subserve _deep sensibility_ and conduct the impulses
produced by pressure as well as those which enable the patient to
recognise the position of a joint on passive movement (joint-sensation),
and the kinaesthetic sense, which recognises that active contraction of
the muscle is taking place (active muscle-sensation). the fibres of this
system run with the motor nerves, and pass to muscles, tendons, and
joints. even division of both the ulnar and the median nerves above the
wrist produces little loss of deep sensibility, unless the tendons are
also cut through. the failure to recognise this form of sensibility has
been largely responsible for the conflicting statements as to the
sensory phenomena following operations for the repair of divided nerves.

2. those which subserve _protopathic_ sensibility--that is, are capable
of responding to painful cutaneous stimuli and to the extremes of heat
and cold. these also endow the hairs with sensibility to pain. they are
the first to regenerate after division.

3. those which subserve _epicritic_ sensibility, the most highly
specialised, capable of appreciating light touch, _e.g._ with a wisp of
cotton wool, as a well-localised sensation, and the finer grades of
temperature, called cool and warm (72 o-104 o f.), and of discriminating
as separate the points of a pair of compasses 2 cms. apart. these are
the last to regenerate.

a nerve also exerts a trophic influence on the tissues in which it is
distributed.

the researches of stoffel on the minute anatomy of the larger nerves,
and the disposition in them of the bundles of nerve fibres supplying
different groups of muscles, have opened up what promises to be a
fruitful field of clinical investigation and therapeutics. he has shown
that in the larger nerve-trunks the nerve bundles for special groups of
muscles are not, as was formerly supposed, arranged irregularly and
fortuitously, but that on the contrary the nerve fibres to a particular
group of muscles have a typical and practically constant position within
the nerve.

in the large nerve-trunks of the limbs he has worked out the exact
position of the bundles for the various groups of muscles, so that in a
cross section of a particular nerve the component bundles can be
labelled as confidently and accurately as can be the cortical areas in
the brain. in the living subject, by using a fine needle-like electrode
and a very weak galvanic current, he has been able to differentiate the
nerve bundles for the various groups of muscles. in several cases of
spastic paralysis he succeeded in picking out in the nerve-trunk of the
affected limb the nerve bundles supplying the spastic muscles, and, by
resecting portions of them, in relieving the spasm. in a case of spastic
contracture of the pronator muscles of the forearm, for example, an
incision is made along the line of the median nerve above the bend of
the elbow. at the lateral side of the median nerve, where it lies in
contact with the biceps muscle, is situated a well-defined and easily
isolated bundle of fibres which supplies the pronator teres, the flexor
carpi radialis, and the palmaris longus muscles. on incising the sheath
of the nerve this bundle can be readily dissected up and its identity
confirmed by stimulating it with a very weak galvanic current. an inch
or more of the bundle is then resected.


injuries of nerves

nerves are liable to be cut or torn across, bruised, compressed,
stretched, or torn away from their connections with the spinal medulla.

#complete division of a mixed nerve.#--complete division is a common
result of accidental wounds, especially above the wrist, where the
ulnar, median, and radial nerves are frequently cut across, and in
gun-shot injuries.

_changes in structure and function._--the mere interruption of the
continuity of a nerve results in degeneration of its fibres, the myelin
being broken up into droplets and absorbed, while the axis cylinders
swell up, disintegrate, and finally disappear. both the conducting and
the insulating elements are thus lost. the degeneration in the central
end of the divided nerve is usually limited to the immediate proximity
of the lesion, and does not even involve all the nerve fibres. in the
distal end, it extends throughout the entire peripheral distribution of
the nerve, and appears to be due to the cutting off of the fibres from
their trophic nerve cells in the spinal medulla. immediate suturing of
the ends does not affect the degeneration of the distal segment. the
peripheral end undergoes complete degeneration in from six weeks to two
months.

the physiological effects of complete division are that the muscles
supplied by the nerve are immediately paralysed, the area to which it
furnishes the sole cutaneous supply becomes insensitive, and the other
structures, including tendons, bones, and joints, lose sensation, and
begin to atrophy from loss of the trophic influence.

#nerves divided in amputation.#--in the case of nerves divided in an
amputation, there is an active, although necessarily abortive, attempt
at regeneration, which results in the formation of bulbous swellings at
the cut ends of the nerves. when there has been suppuration, and
especially if the nerves have been cut so as to be exposed in the wound,
these bulbous swellings may attain an abnormal size, and are then known
as "amputation" or "stump neuromas" (fig. 84).

when the nerves in a stump have not been cut sufficiently short, they
may become involved in the cicatrix, and it may be necessary, on account
of pain, to free them from their adhesions, and to resect enough of the
terminal portions to prevent them again becoming adherent. when this is
difficult, a portion may be resected from each of the nerve-trunks at a
higher level; and if this fails to give relief, a fresh amputation may
be performed. when there is agonising pain dependent upon an ascending
neuritis, it may be necessary to resect the corresponding posterior
nerve roots within the vertebral canal.

[illustration: fig. 84.--stump neuromas of sciatic nerve, excised forty
years after the original amputation by mr. a. g. miller.]

#other injuries of nerves.#--_contusion_ of a nerve-trunk is attended
with extravasation of blood into the connective-tissue sheaths, and is
followed by degeneration of the contused nerve fibres. function is
usually restored, the conducting paths being re-established by the
formation of new nerve fibres.

when a nerve is _torn across_ or badly _crushed_--as, for example, by a
fractured bone--the changes are similar to those in a divided nerve, and
the ultimate result depends on the amount of separation between the ends
and the possibility of the young axis cylinders bridging the gap.

_involvement of nerves in scar tissue._--pressure or traction may be
exerted upon a nerve by contracting scar tissue, or a process of
neuritis or perineuritis may be induced.

when terminal filaments are involved in a scar, it is best to dissect
out the scar, and along with it the ends of the nerves pressed upon.
when a nerve-trunk, such as the sciatic, is involved in cicatricial
tissue, the nerve must be exposed and freed from its surroundings
(_neurolysis_), and then stretched so as to tear any adhesions that may
be present above or below the part exposed. it may be advisable to
displace the liberated nerve from its original position so as to
minimise the risk of its incorporation in the scar of the original wound
or in that resulting from the operation--for example, the radial nerve
may be buried in the substance of the triceps, or it may be surrounded
by a segment of vein or portion of fat-bearing fascia.

_injuries of nerves resulting from_ #gun-shot wounds# include: (1) those
in which the nerve is directly damaged by the bullet, and (2) those in
which the nerve-trunk is involved secondarily either by scar tissue in
its vicinity or by callus following fracture of an adjacent bone. the
primary injuries include contusion, partial or complete division, and
perforation of the nerve-trunk. one of the most constant symptoms is the
early occurrence of severe neuralgic pain, and this is usually
associated with marked hyperaesthesia.

#regeneration.#--_process of repair when the ends are in contact._--_if
the wound is aseptic_, and the ends of the divided nerve are sutured or
remain in contact, they become united, and the conducting paths are
re-established by a regeneration of nerve fibres. there is a difference
of opinion as to the method of regeneration. the wallerian doctrine is
that the axis cylinders in the central end grow downwards, and enter the
nerve sheaths of the distal portion, and continue growing until they
reach the peripheral terminations in muscle and skin, and in course of
time acquire a myelin sheath; the cells of the neurolemma multiply and
form long chains in both ends of the nerve, and are believed to provide
for the nourishment and support of the actively lengthening axis
cylinders. another view is that the formation of new axis cylinders is
not confined to the central end, but that it goes on also in the
peripheral segment, in which, however, the new axis cylinders do not
attain maturity until continuity with the central end has been
re-established.

_if the wound becomes infected_ and suppuration occurs, the young nerve
fibres are destroyed and efficient regeneration is prevented; the
formation of scar tissue also may constitute a permanent obstacle to new
nerve fibres bridging the gap.

_when the ends are not in contact_, reunion of the divided nerve fibres
does not take place whether the wound is infected or not. at the
proximal end there forms a bulbous swelling, which becomes adherent to
the scar tissue. it consists of branching axis cylinders running in all
directions, these having failed to reach the distal end because of the
extent of the gap. the peripheral end is completely degenerated, and is
represented by a fibrous cord, the cut end of which is often slightly
swollen or bulbous, and is also incorporated with the scar tissue of
the wound.

#clinical features.#--the symptoms resulting from division and non-union
of a nerve-trunk necessarily vary with the functions of the affected
nerve. the following description refers to a mixed sensori-motor trunk,
such as the median or radial (musculo-spiral) nerve.

_sensory phenomena._--superficial touch is tested by means of a wisp of
cotton wool stroked gently across the skin; the capacity of
discriminating two points as separate, by a pair of blunt-pointed
compasses; the sensation of pressure, by means of a pencil or other
blunt object; of pain, by pricking or scratching with a needle; and of
sensibility to heat and cold, by test-tubes containing water at
different temperatures. while these tests are being carried out, the
patient's eyes are screened off.

after division of a nerve containing sensory fibres, there is an area of
absolute cutaneous insensibility to touch (anaesthesia), to pain
(analgesia), and to all degrees of temperature--_loss of protopathic
sensibility_; surrounded by an area in which there is loss of sensation
to light touch, inability to recognise minor differences of temperature
(72 o-104 o f.), and to appreciate as separate impressions the contact of
the two points of a compass--_loss of epicritic sensibility_ (head and
sherren) (figs. 91, 92).

_motor phenomena._--there is immediate and complete loss of voluntary
power in the muscles supplied by the divided nerve. the muscles rapidly
waste, and within from three to five days, they cease to react to the
faradic current. when tested with the galvanic current, it is found that
a stronger current must be used to call forth contraction than in a
healthy muscle, and the contraction appears first at the closing of the
circuit when the anode is used as the testing electrode. the loss of
excitability to the interrupted current, and the specific alteration in
the type of contraction with the constant current, is known as the
_reaction of degeneration_. after a few weeks all electric excitability
is lost. the paralysed muscles undergo fatty degeneration, which attains
its maximum three or four months after the division of the nerve.
further changes may take place, and result in the transformation of the
muscle into fibrous tissue, which by undergoing shortening may cause
deformity known as _paralytic contracture_.

_vaso-motor phenomena._--in the majority of cases there is an initial
rise in the temperature of the part (2 o to 3 o f.), with redness and
increased vascularity. this is followed by a fall in the local
temperature, which may amount to 8 o or 10 o f., the parts becoming pale
and cold. sometimes the hyperaemia resulting from vaso-motor paralysis is
more persistent, and is associated with swelling of the parts from
oedema--the so-called _angio-neurotic oedema_. the vascularity varies with
external influences, and in cold weather the parts present a bluish
appearance.

_trophic phenomena._--owing to the disappearance of the subcutaneous
fat, the skin is smooth and thin, and may be abnormally dry. the hair is
harsh, dry, and easily shed. the nails become brittle and furrowed, or
thick and curved, and the ends of the fingers become club-shaped. skin
eruptions, especially in the form of blisters, occur, or there may be
actual ulcers of the skin, especially in winter. in aggravated cases the
tips of the fingers disappear from progressive ulceration, and in the
sole of the foot a perforating ulcer may develop. arthropathies are
occasionally met with, the joints becoming the seat of a painless
effusion or hydrops, which is followed by fibrous thickening of the
capsular and other ligaments, and terminates in stiffness and fibrous
ankylosis. in this way the fingers are seriously crippled and deformed.

#treatment of divided nerves.#--the treatment consists in approximating
the divided ends of the nerve and placing them under the most favourable
conditions for repair, and this should be done at the earliest possible
opportunity. (_op. surg._, pp. 45, 46.)

#primary suture.#--the reunion of a recently divided nerve is spoken of
as primary suture, and for its success asepsis is essential. as the
suturing of the ends of the nerve is extremely painful, an anaesthetic is
required.

when the wound is healed and while waiting for the restoration of
function, measures are employed to maintain the nutrition of the damaged
nerve and of the parts supplied by it. the limb is exercised, massaged,
and douched, and protected from cold and other injurious influences. the
nutrition of the paralysed muscles is further improved by electricity.
the galvanic current is employed, using at first a mild current of not
more than 5 milliamperes for about ten minutes, the current being made
to flow downwards in the course of the nerve, with the positive
electrode applied to the spine, and the negative over the affected nerve
near its termination. it is an advantage to have a metronome in the
circuit whereby the current is opened and closed automatically at
intervals, so as to cause contraction of the muscles.

_the results_ of primary suture, when it has been performed under
favourable conditions, are usually satisfactory. in a series of cases
investigated by head and sherren, the period between the operation and
the first return of sensation averaged 65 days. according to purves
stewart protopathic sensation commences to appear in about six weeks and
is completely restored in six months; electric sensation and motor power
reappear together in about six months, and restoration is complete in a
year. when sensation returns, the area of insensibility to pain steadily
diminishes and disappears; sensibility to extremes of temperature
appears soon after; and last of all, after a considerable interval,
there is simultaneous return of appreciation of light touch, moderate
degrees of temperature, and the points of a compass.

a clinical means of estimating how regeneration in a divided nerve is
progressing has been described by tinel. he found that a tingling
sensation, similar to that experienced in the foot, when it is
recovering from the "sleeping" condition induced by prolonged pressure
on the sciatic nerve from sitting on a hard bench, can be elicited on
percussing over _growing_ axis cylinders. tapping over the proximal end
of a _newly divided nerve_, _e.g._ the common peroneal behind the head
of the fibula, produces no tingling, but when in about three weeks
axis cylinders begin to grow in the proximal end-bulb, local tingling is
induced by tapping there. the downward growth of the axis cylinders can
be traced by tapping over the distal segment of the nerve, the tingling
sensation being elicited as far down as the young axis cylinders have
reached. when the regeneration of the axis cylinders is complete,
tapping no longer causes tingling. it usually takes about one hundred
days for this stage to be reached.

tinel's sign is present before voluntary movement, muscular tone, or the
normal electrical reactions reappear.

in cases of complete nerve paralysis that have not been operated upon,
the tingling test is helpful in determining whether or not regeneration
is taking place. its detection may prevent an unnecessary operation
being performed.

primary suture should not be attempted so long as the wound shows signs
of infection, as it is almost certain to end in failure. the ends should
be sutured, however, as soon as the wound is aseptic or has healed.

#secondary suture.#--the term secondary suture is applied to the
operation of stitching the ends of the divided nerve after the wound has
healed.

_results of secondary suture._--when secondary suture has been performed
under favourable conditions, the prognosis is good, but a longer time is
required for restoration of function than after primary suture. purves
stewart says protopathic sensation is sometimes observed much earlier
than in primary suture, because partial regeneration of axis cylinders
in the peripheral segment has already taken place. sensation is
recovered first, but it seldom returns before three or four months.
there then follows an improvement or disappearance of any trophic
disturbances that may be present. recovery of motion may be deferred for
long periods--rather because of the changes in the muscles than from
want of conductivity in the nerve--and if the muscles have undergone
complete degeneration, it may never take place at all. while waiting for
recovery, every effort should be made to maintain the nutrition of the
damaged nerve, and of the parts which it supplies.

when suture is found to be impossible, recourse must be had to other
methods, known as nerve bridging and nerve implantation.

#incomplete division of a mixed nerve.#--the effects of partial division
of a mixed nerve vary according to the destination of the nerve bundles
that have been interrupted. within their area of distribution the
paralysis is as complete as if the whole trunk had been cut across. the
uninjured nerve-bundles continue to transmit impulses with the result
that there is a _dissociated paralysis_ within the distribution of the
affected nerve, some muscles continuing to act and to respond normally
to electric stimulation, while others behave as if the whole nerve-trunk
had been severed.

in addition to vasomotor and trophic changes, there is often severe pain
of a burning kind (_causalgia_ or _thermalgia_) which comes on about a
fortnight after the injury and causes intense and continuous suffering
which may last for months. paroxysms of pain may be excited by the
slightest touch or by heat, and the patient usually learns for himself
that the constant application of cold wet cloths allays the pain. the
thermalgic area sweats profusely.

operative treatment is indicated where there is no sign of improvement
within three months, when recovery is arrested before complete
restoration of function is attained, or when thermalgic pain is
excessive.

#subcutaneous injuries of nerves.#--several varieties of subcutaneous
injuries of nerves are met with. one of the best known is the
compression paralysis of the nerves of the upper arm which results from
sleeping with the arm resting on the back of a chair or the edge of a
table--the so-called "drunkard's palsy"; and from the pressure of a
crutch in the axilla--"crutch paralysis." in some of these injuries,
notably "drunkard's palsy," the disability appears to be due not to
damage of the nerve, but to overstretching of the extensors of the wrist
and fingers (jones). a similar form of paralysis is sometimes met with
from the pressure of a tourniquet, from tight bandages or splints, from
the pressure exerted by a dislocated bone or by excessive callus, and
from hyper-extension of the arm during anaesthesia.

in all these forms there is impaired sensation, rarely amounting to
anaesthesia, marked muscular wasting, and diminution or loss of voluntary
motor power, while--and this is a point of great importance--the normal
electrical reactions are preserved. there may also develop trophic
changes such as blisters, superficial ulcers, and clubbing of the tips
of the fingers. the prognosis is usually favourable, as recovery is the
rule within from one to three months. if, however, neuritis supervenes,
the electrical reactions are altered, the muscles degenerate, and
recovery may be retarded or may fail to take place.

injuries which act abruptly or instantaneously are illustrated in the
crushing of a nerve by the sudden displacement of a sharp-edged fragment
of bone, as may occur in comminuted fractures of the humerus. the
symptoms include perversion or loss of sensation, motor paralysis, and
atrophy of muscles, which show the reaction of degeneration from the
eighth day onwards. the presence of the reaction of degeneration
influences both the prognosis and the treatment, for it implies a lesion
which is probably incapable of spontaneous recovery, and which can only
be remedied by operation.

the _treatment_ varies with the cause and nature of the lesion. when,
for example, a displaced bone or a mass of callus is pressing upon the
nerve, steps must be taken to relieve the pressure, by operation if
necessary. when there is reason to believe that the nerve is severely
crushed or torn across, it should be exposed by incision, and, after
removal of the damaged ends, should be united by sutures. when it is
impossible to make a definite diagnosis as to the state of the nerve, it
is better to expose it by operation, and thus learn the exact state of
affairs without delay; in the event of the nerve being torn, the ends
should be united by sutures.

#dislocation of nerves.#--this injury, which resembles the dislocation
of tendons from their grooves, is seldom met with except in the ulnar
nerve at the elbow, and is described with injuries of that nerve.


diseases of nerves

#traumatic neuritis.#--this consists in an overgrowth of the
connective-tissue framework of a nerve, which causes irritation and
pressure upon the nerve fibres, sometimes resulting in their
degeneration. it may originate in connection with a wound in the
vicinity of a nerve, as, for example, when the brachial nerves are
involved in scar tissue subsequent to an operation for clearing out the
axilla for cancer; or in contusion and compression of a nerve--for
example, by the pressure of the head of the humerus in a dislocation of
the shoulder. some weeks or months after the injury, the patient
complains of increasing hyperaesthesia and of neuralgic pains in the
course of the nerve. the nerve is very sensitive to pressure, and, if
superficial, may be felt to be swollen. the associated muscles are
wasted and weak, and are subject to twitchings. there are also trophic
disturbances. it is rare to have complete sensory and motor paralysis.
the disease is commonest in the nerves of the upper extremity, and the
hand may become crippled and useless.

_treatment._--any constitutional condition which predisposes to
neuritis, such as gout, diabetes, or syphilis, must receive appropriate
treatment. the symptoms may be relieved by rest and by soothing
applications, such as belladonna, ichthyol, or menthol, by the use of
hot-air and electric baths, and in obstinate cases by blistering or by
the application of corrigan's button. when such treatment fails the
nerve may be stretched, or, in the case of a purely sensory trunk, a
portion may be excised. local causes, such as involvement of the nerve
in a scar or in adhesions, may afford indications for operative
treatment.

#multiple peripheral neuritis.#--although this disease mainly comes
under the cognizance of the physician, it may be attended with phenomena
which call for surgical interference. in this country it is commonly due
to alcoholism, but it may result from diabetes or from chronic poisoning
with lead or arsenic, or from bacterial infections and intoxications
such as occur in diphtheria, gonorrhoea, syphilis, leprosy, typhoid,
influenza, beri-beri, and many other diseases.

it is, as a rule, widely distributed throughout the peripheral nerves,
but the distribution frequently varies with the cause--the alcoholic
form, for example, mainly affecting the legs, the diphtheritic form the
soft palate and pharynx, and that associated with lead poisoning the
forearms. the essential lesion is a degeneration of the conducting
fibres of the affected nerves, and the prominent symptoms are the result
of this. in alcoholic neuritis there is great tenderness of the muscles.
when the legs are affected the patient may be unable to walk, and the
toes may droop and the heel be drawn up, resulting in one variety of pes
equino-varus. pressure sores and perforating ulcer of the foot are the
most important trophic phenomena.

apart from the medical _treatment_, measures must be taken to prevent
deformity, especially when the legs are affected. the bedclothes are
supported by a cage, and the foot maintained at right angles to the leg
by sand-bags or splints. when the disease is subsiding, the nutrition of
the damaged nerves and muscles should be maintained by massage, baths,
passive movements, and the use of the galvanic current. when deformity
has been allowed to take place, operative measures may be required for
its correction.


neuroma[5]

[5] we have followed the classification adopted by alexis thomson in his
work _on neuroma, and neuro-fibromatosis_ (edinburgh: 1900).

neuroma is a clinical term applied to all tumours, irrespective of their
structure, which have their seat in nerves.

a tumour composed of newly formed nerve tissue is spoken of as a #true
neuroma#; when ganglionic cells are present in addition to nerve fibres,
the name _ganglionic neuroma_ is applied. these tumours are rare, and
are chiefly met with in the main cords or abdominal plexuses of the
sympathetic system of children or young adults. they are quite
insensitive, and their removal is only called for if they cause pain or
show signs of malignancy.

a #false neuroma# is an overgrowth of the sheath of a nerve. this
overgrowth may result in the formation of a circumscribed tumour, or may
take the form of a diffuse fibromatosis.

_the circumscribed or solitary tumour_ grows from the sheath of a nerve
which is otherwise healthy, and it may be innocent or malignant.

_the innocent_ form is usually fibrous or myxomatous, and is definitely
encapsulated. it may become cystic as a result of haemorrhage or of
myxomatous degeneration. it grows very slowly, is usually elliptical in
shape, and the solid form is rarely larger than a hazel-nut. the nerve
fibres may be spread out all round the tumour, or may run only on one
side of it. when subcutaneous and related to the smaller unnamed
cutaneous nerves, it is known as a _painful subcutaneous nodule_ or
_tubercle_. it is chiefly met with about the ankle, and most often in
women. it is remarkably sensitive, even gentle handling causing intense
pain, which usually radiates to the periphery of the nerve affected.
when related to a deeper, named nerve-trunk, it is known as a
_trunk-neuroma_. it is usually less sensitive than the "subcutaneous
nodule," and rarely gives rise to motor symptoms unless it involves the
nerve roots where they pass through bony canals.

a trunk-neuroma is recognised clinically by its position in the line of
a nerve, by the fact that it is movable in the transverse axis of the
nerve but not in its long axis, and by being unduly painful and
sensitive.

[illustration: fig. 85.--amputation stump of upper arm, showing bulbous
thickening of the ends of the nerves, embedded in scar tissue at the
apex of the stamp.]

_treatment._--if the tumour causes suffering it should be removed,
preferably by shelling it out from the investing nerve sheath or
capsule. in the subcutaneous nodule the nerve is rarely recognisable,
and is usually sacrificed. when removal of the tumour is incomplete, a
tube of radium should be inserted into the cavity, to prevent recurrence
of the tumour in a malignant form.

_the malignant neuroma_ is a sarcoma growing from the sheath of a nerve.
it has the same characters and clinical features as the innocent
variety, only it grows more rapidly, and by destroying the nerve fibres
causes motor symptoms--jerkings followed by paralysis. the sarcoma tends
to spread along the lymph spaces in the long axis of the nerve, as well
as to implicate the surrounding tissues, and it is liable to give rise
to secondary growths. the malignant neuroma is met with chiefly in the
sciatic and other large nerves of the limbs.

the _treatment_ is conducted on the same lines as sarcoma in other
situations; the insertion of a tube of radium after removal of the
tumour diminishes the tendency to recurrence; a portion of the
nerve-trunk being sacrificed, means must be taken to bridge the gap. in
inoperable cases it may be possible to relieve pain by excising a
portion of the nerve above the tumour, or, when this is impracticable,
by resecting the posterior nerve roots and their ganglia within the
vertebral canal.

the so-called _amputation neuroma_ has already been referred to (p. 344).

_diffuse or generalised neuro-fibromatosis--recklinghausen's
disease._--these terms are now used to include what were formerly known
as "multiple neuromata," as well as certain other overgrowths related to
nerves. the essential lesion is an overgrowth of the endoneural
connective tissue throughout the nerves of both the cerebro-spinal and
sympathetic systems. the nerves are diffusely and unequally thickened,
so that small twigs may become enlarged to the size of the median, while
at irregular intervals along their course the connective-tissue
overgrowth is exaggerated so as to form tumour-like swellings similar to
the trunk-neuroma already described. the tumours, which vary greatly in
size and number--as many as a thousand have been counted in one
case--are enclosed in a capsule derived from the perineurium. the
fibromatosis may also affect the cranial nerves, the ganglia on the
posterior nerve roots, the nerves within the vertebral canal, and the
sympathetic nerves and ganglia, as well as the continuations of the
motor nerves within the muscles. the nerve fibres, although mechanically
displaced and dissociated by the overgrown endoneurium, undergo no
structural change except when compressed in passing through a bony
canal.

the disease probably originates before birth, although it may not make
its appearance till adolescence or even till adult life. it is sometimes
met with in several members of one family. it is recognised clinically
by the presence of multiple tumours in the course of the nerves, and
sometimes by palpable enlargement of the superficial nerve-trunks
(fig. 86). the tumours resemble the solitary trunk-neuroma, are usually
quite insensitive, and many of them are unknown to the patient. as a
result of injury or other exciting cause, however, one or other tumour
may increase in size and become extremely sensitive; the pain is then
agonising; it is increased by handling, and interferes with sleep. in
these conditions, a malignant transformation of the fibroma into sarcoma
is to be suspected. motor disturbances are exceptional, unless in the
case of tumours within the vertebral canal, which press on the spinal
medulla and cause paraplegia.

[illustration: fig. 86.--diffuse enlargement of nerves in generalised
neuro-fibromatosis.

(after r. w. smith.)]

neuro-fibromatosis is frequently accompanied by _pigmentation of the
skin_ in the form of brown spots or patches scattered over the trunk.

the disease is often stationary for long periods. in progressive cases
the patient becomes exhausted, and usually dies of some intercurrent
affection, particularly phthisis. the treatment is restricted to
relieving symptoms and complications; removal of one of the tumours is
to be strongly deprecated.

in a considerable proportion of cases one of the multiple tumours takes
on the characters of a malignant growth ("secondary malignant neuroma,"
garre). this malignant transformation may follow upon injury, or on an
unsuccessful attempt to remove the tumour. the features are those of a
rapidly growing sarcoma involving a nerve-trunk, with agonising pain
and muscular cramps, followed by paralysis from destruction of the
nerve fibres. the removal of the tumour is usually followed by
recurrence, so that high amputation is the only treatment to be
recommended. metastasis to internal organs is exceptional.

[illustration: fig. 87.--plexiform neuroma of small sciatic nerve, from
a girl aet. 16.

(mr. annandale's case.)]

there are other types of neuro-fibromatosis which require brief mention.

_the plexiform neuroma_ (fig. 87) is a fibromatosis confined to the
distribution of one or more contiguous nerves or of a plexus of nerves,
and it may occur either by itself or along with multiple tumours of the
nerve-trunks and with pigmentation of the skin. the clinical features
are those of an ill-defined swelling composed of a number of tortuous,
convoluted cords, lying in a loose areolar tissue and freely movable on
one another. it is rarely the seat of pain or tenderness. it most often
appears in the early years of life, sometimes in relation to a pigmented
or hairy mole. it is of slow growth, may remain stationary for long
periods, and has little or no tendency to become malignant. it is
usually subcutaneous, and is frequently situated on the head or neck in
the distribution of the trigeminal or superficial cervical nerves. there
is no necessity for its removal, but this may be indicated because of
disfigurement, especially on the face or scalp or because its bulk
interferes with function. when involving the ophthalmic division of the
trigeminus, for example, it may cause enlargement of the upper lid and
proptosis, with danger to the function of the globe. the results of
excision are usually satisfactory, even if the removal is not complete.

[illustration: fig. 88.--multiple neuro-fibromas of skin (molluscum
fibrosum, or recklinghausen's disease).]

_the cutaneous neuro-fibroma_ or _molluscum fibrosum_ has been shown by
recklinghausen to be a soft fibroma related to the terminal filaments of
one of the cutaneous nerves (fig. 88). the disease appears in the form
of multiple, soft, projecting tumours, scattered all over the body,
except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. the tumours are of
all sizes, some being no larger than a pin's head, whilst many are as
big as a filbert and a few even larger. many are sessile and others are
distinctly pedunculated, but all are covered with skin. they are mobile,
soft to the touch, and of the consistence of firm fat. in exceptional
cases one of the skin tumours may attain an enormous size and cause a
hideous deformity, hanging down by its own weight in lobulated or folded
masses (pachy-dermatocele). the treatment consists in removing the
larger swellings. in some cases molluscum fibrosum is associated with
pigmentation of the skin and with multiple tumours of the nerve-trunks.
the small multiple tumours rarely call for interference.

[illustration: fig. 89.--elephantiasis neuromatosa in a woman aet. 28]

_elephantiasis neuromatosa_ is the name applied by virchow to a
condition in which a limb is swollen and misshapen as a result of the
extension of a neuro-fibromatosis to the skin and subcutaneous cellular
tissue of the extremity as a whole (fig. 89). it usually begins in early
life without apparent cause, and it may be associated with multiple
tumours of the nerve-trunks. the inconvenience caused by the bulk and
weight of the limb may justify its removal.


surgery of the individual nerves[6]

[6] we desire here to acknowledge our indebtedness to mr. james
sherren's work on _injuries of nerves and their treatment_.

#the brachial plexus.#--lesions of the brachial plexus may be divided
into those above the clavicle and those below that bone.

in the #supra-clavicular injuries#, the violence applied to the head or
shoulder causes over-stretching of the anterior branches (primary
divisions) of the cervical nerves, the fifth, or the fifth and sixth
being those most liable to suffer. sometimes the traction is exerted
upon the plexus from below, as when a man in falling from a height
endeavours to save himself by clutching at some projection, and the
lesion then mainly affects the first dorsal nerve. there is tearing of
the nerve sheaths, with haemorrhage, but in severe cases partial or
complete severance of nerve fibres may occur and these give way at
different levels. during the healing process an excess of fibrous tissue
is formed, which may interfere with regeneration.

_post-anaesthetic paralysis_ occurs in patients in whom, during the
course of an operation, the arm is abducted and rotated laterally or
extended above the head, causing over-stretching of the plexus,
especially of the fifth, or fifth and sixth, anterior branches.

a _cervical rib_ may damage the plexus by direct pressure, the part
usually affected being the medial cord, which is made up of fibres from
the eighth cervical and first dorsal nerves.

when a lesion of the plexus complicates a _fracture of the clavicle_,
the nerve injury is due, not to pressure on or laceration of the nerves
by fragments of bone, but to the violence causing the fracture, and this
is usually applied to the point of the shoulder.

penetrating _wounds_, apart from those met with in military practice,
are rare.

in the #infra-clavicular injuries#, the lesion most often results from
the pressure of the dislocated head of the humerus; occasionally from
attempts made to reduce the dislocation by the heel-in-the-axilla
method, or from fracture of the upper end of the humerus or of the neck
of the scapula. the whole plexus may suffer, but more frequently the
medial cord is alone implicated.

_clinical features._--three types of lesion result from indirect
violence: the whole plexus; the upper-arm type; and the lower-arm type.

_when the whole plexus is involved_, sensibility is lost over the entire
forearm and hand and over the lateral surface of the arm in its distal
two-thirds. all the muscles of the arm, forearm, and hand are paralysed,
and, as a rule, also the pectorals and spinati, but the rhomboids and
serratus anterior escape. there is paralysis of the sympathetic fibres
to the eye and orbit, with narrowing of the palpebral fissure, recession
of the globe, and the pupil is slow to dilate when shaded from the
light.

the _upper-arm type_--erb-duchenne paralysis--is that most frequently
met with, and it is due to a lesion of the fifth anterior branch, or, it
may be, also of the sixth. the position of the upper limb is typical:
the arm and forearm hang close to the side, with the forearm extended
and pronated; the deltoid, spinati, biceps, brachialis, and supinators
are paralysed, and in some cases the radial extensors of the wrist and
the pronator teres are also affected. the patient is unable to supinate
the forearm or to abduct the arm, and in most cases to flex the forearm.
he may, however, regain some power of flexing the forearm when it is
fully pronated, the extensors of the wrist becoming feeble flexors of
the elbow. there is, as a rule, no loss of sensibility, but complaint
may be made of tickling and of pins-and-needles over the lateral aspect
of the arm. the abnormal position of the limb may persist although the
muscles regain the power of voluntary movement, and as the condition
frequently follows a fall on the shoulder, great care is necessary in
diagnosis, as the condition is apt to be attributed to an injury to the
axillary (circumflex) nerve.

the _lower-arm type_ of paralysis, associated with the name of klumpke,
is usually due to over-stretching of the plexus, and especially affects
the anterior branch of the first dorsal nerve. in typical cases all the
intrinsic muscles of the hand are affected, and the hand assumes the
claw shape. sensibility is usually altered over the medial side of the
arm and forearm, and there is paralysis of the sympathetic.

_infra-clavicular injuries_, as already stated, are most often produced
by a sub-coracoid dislocation of the humerus; the medial cord is that
most frequently injured, and the muscles paralysed are those supplied by
the ulnar nerve, with, in addition, those intrinsic muscles of the hand
supplied by the median. sensibility is affected over the medial surface
of the forearm and ulnar area of the hand. injury of the lateral and
posterior cords is very rare.

_treatment_ is carried out on the lines already laid down for nerve
injuries in general. it is impossible to diagnose between complete and
incomplete rupture of the nerve cords, until sufficient time has elapsed
to allow of the establishment of the reaction of degeneration. if this
is present at the end of fourteen days, operation should not be delayed.
access to the cords of the plexus is obtained by a dissection similar to
that employed for the subclavian artery, and the nerves are sought for
as they emerge from under cover of the scalenus anterior, and are then
traced until the seat of injury is found. in the case of the first
dorsal nerve, it may be necessary temporarily to resect the clavicle.
the usual after-treatment must be persisted in until recovery ensues,
and care must be taken that the paralysed muscles do not become
over-stretched. the prognosis is less favourable in the supra-clavicular
lesions than in those below the clavicle, which nearly always recover
without surgical intervention.

in the _brachial birth-paralysis_ met with in infants, the lesion is due
to over-stretching of the plexus, and is nearly always of the
erb-duchenne type. the injury is usually unilateral, it occurs with
almost equal frequency in breech and in vertex presentations, and the
left arm is more often affected than the right. the lesion is seldom
recognised at birth. the first symptom noticed is tenderness in the
supra-clavicular region, the child crying when this part is touched or
the arm is moved. the attitude may be that of the erb-duchenne type, or
the whole of the muscles of the upper limb may be flaccid, and the arm
hangs powerless. a considerable proportion of the cases recover
spontaneously. the arm is to be kept at rest, with the affected muscles
relaxed, and, as soon as tenderness has disappeared, daily massage and
passive movements are employed. the reaction of degeneration can rarely
be satisfactorily tested before the child is three months old, but if it
is present, an operation should be performed. after operation, the
shoulder should be elevated so that no traction is exerted on the
affected cords.

#the long thoracic nerve# (nerve of bell), which supplies the serratus
anterior, is rarely injured. in those whose occupation entails carrying
weights upon the shoulder it may be contused, and the resulting
paralysis of the serratus is usually combined with paralysis of the
lower part of the trapezius, the branches from the third and fourth
cervical nerves which supply this muscle also being exposed to pressure
as they pass across the root of the neck. there is complaint of pain
above the clavicle, and winging of the scapula; the patient is unable to
raise the arm in front of the body above the level of the shoulder or to
perform any forward pushing movements; on attempting either of these the
winging of the scapula is at once increased. if the scapula is compared
with that on the sound side, it is seen that, in addition to the lower
angle being more prominent, the spine is more horizontal and the lower
angle nearer the middle line. the majority of these cases recover if the
limb is placed at absolute rest, the elbow supported, and massage and
galvanism persevered with. if the paralysis persists, the sterno-costal
portion of the pectoralis major may be transplanted to the lower angle
of the scapula.

the long thoracic nerve may be cut across while clearing out the axilla
in operating for cancer of the breast. the displacement of the scapula
is not so marked as in the preceding type, and the patient is able to
perform pushing movements below the level of the shoulder. if the
reaction of degeneration develops, an operation may be performed, the
ends of the nerve being sutured, or the distal end grafted into the
posterior cord of the brachial plexus.

#the axillary (circumflex) nerve.#--in the majority of cases in which
paralysis of the deltoid follows upon an injury of the shoulder, it is
due to a lesion of the fifth cervical nerve, as has already been
described in injuries of the brachial plexus. the axillary nerve itself
as it passes round the neck of the humerus is most liable to be injured
from the pressure of a crutch, or of the head of the humerus in
sub-glenoid dislocation, or in fracture of the neck of the scapula or of
the humerus. in miners, who work for long periods lying on the side, the
muscle may be paralysed by direct pressure on the terminal filaments of
the nerve, and the nerve may also be involved as a result of disease in
the sub-deltoid bursa.

the deltoid is wasted, and the acromion unduly prominent. in recent
cases paralysis of the muscle is easily detected. in cases of long
standing it is not so simple, because other muscles, the spinati, the
clavicular fibres of the pectoral and the serratus, take its place and
elevate the arm; there is always loss of sensation on the lateral aspect
of the shoulder. there is rarely any call for operative treatment, as
the paralysis is usually compensated for by other muscles.

when the _supra-scapular nerve_ is contused or stretched in injuries of
the shoulder, the spinati muscles are paralysed and wasted, the spine of
the scapula is unduly prominent, and there is impairment in the power of
abducting the arm and rotating it laterally.

the _musculo-cutaneous nerve_ is very rarely injured; when cut across,
there is paralysis of the coraco-brachialis, biceps, and part of the
brachialis, but no movements are abolished, the forearm being flexed, in
the pronated position, by the brachio-radialis and long radial extensor
of the wrist; in the supinated position, by that portion of the
brachialis supplied by the radial nerve. supination is feebly performed
by the supinator muscle. protopathic and epicritic sensibility are lost
over the radial side of the forearm.

#radial (musculo-spiral) nerve.#--from its anatomical relationships this
trunk is more exposed to injury than any other nerve in the body. it is
frequently compressed against the humerus in sleeping with the arm
resting on the back of a chair, especially in the deep sleep of
alcoholic intoxication (drunkard's palsy). it may be pressed upon by a
crutch in the axilla, by the dislocated head of the humerus, or by
violent compression of the arm, as when an elastic tourniquet is applied
too tightly. the most serious and permanent injuries of this nerve are
associated with fractures of the humerus, especially those from direct
violence attended with comminution of the bone. the nerve may be crushed
or torn by one of the fragments at the time of the injury, or at a later
period may be compressed by callus.

_clinical features._--immediately after the injury it is impossible to
tell whether the nerve is torn across or merely compressed. the patient
may complain of numbness and tingling in the distribution of the
superficial branch of the nerve, but it is a striking fact, that so long
as the nerve is divided below the level at which it gives off the dorsal
cutaneous nerve of the forearm (external cutaneous branch), there is no
loss of sensation. when it is divided above the origin of the dorsal
cutaneous branch, or when the dorsal branch of the musculo-cutaneous
nerve is also divided, there is a loss of sensibility on the dorsum
of the hand.

the motor symptoms predominate, the muscles affected being the extensors
of the wrist and fingers, and the supinators. there is a characteristic
"drop-wrist"; the wrist is flexed and pronated, and the patient is
unable to dorsiflex the wrist or fingers (fig. 90). if the hand and
proximal phalanges are supported, the second and third phalanges may be
partly extended by the interossei and lumbricals. there is also
considerable impairment of power in the muscles which antagonise those
that are paralysed, so that the grasp of the hand is feeble, and the
patient almost loses the use of it; in some cases this would appear to
be due to the median nerve having been injured at the same time.

[illustration: fig. 90.--drop-wrist following fracture of shaft of
humerus.]

if the lesion is high up, as it is, for example, in crutch paralysis,
the triceps and anconeus may also suffer.

_treatment._--the slighter forms of injury by compression recover under
massage, douching, and electricity. if there is drop-wrist, the hand and
forearm are placed on a palmar splint, with the hand dorsiflexed to
nearly a right angle, and this position is maintained until voluntary
dorsiflexion at the wrist returns to the normal. recovery is sometimes
delayed for several months.

in the more severe injuries associated with fracture of the humerus and
attended with the reaction of degeneration, it is necessary to cut down
upon the nerve and free it from the pressure of a fragment of bone or
from callus or adhesions. if the nerve is torn across, the ends must be
sutured, and if this is impossible owing to loss of tissue, the gap may
be bridged by a graft taken from the superficial branch of the radial
nerve, or the ends may be implanted into the median.

finally, in cases in which the paralysis is permanent and incurable, the
disability may be relieved by operation. a fascial graft can be employed
to act as a ligament permanently extending the wrist; it is attached to
the third and fourth metacarpal bones distally and to the radius or ulna
proximally. the flexor carpi radialis can then be joined up with the
extensor digitorum communis by passing its tendon through an aperture in
the interosseous membrane, or better still, through the pronator
quadratus, as there is less likelihood of the formation of adhesions
when the tendon passes through muscle than through interosseous
membrane. the palmaris longus is anastomosed with the abductor pollicis
longus (extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis), thus securing a fair amount
of abduction of the thumb. the flexor carpi ulnaris may also be
anastomosed with the common extensor of the fingers. the extensors of
the wrist may be shortened, so as to place the hand in the position of
dorsal flexion, and thus improve the attitude and grasp of the hand.

_the superficial branch of the radial_ (radial nerve) _and the deep
branch_ (posterior interosseous), apart from suffering in lesions of the
radial, are liable to be contused or torn is dislocation of the head of
the radius, and in fracture of the neck of the bone. the deep branch may
be divided as it passes through the supinator in operations on old
fractures and dislocations in the region of the elbow. division of the
superficial branch in the upper two-thirds of the forearm produces no
loss of sensibility; division in the lower third after the nerve has
become associated with branches from the musculo-cutaneous is followed
by a loss of sensibility on the radial side of the hand and thumb. wounds
on the dorsal surface of the wrist and forearm are often followed by
loss of sensibility over a larger area, because the musculo-cutaneous
nerve is divided as well, and some of the fibres of the lower lateral
cutaneous branch of the radial.

[illustration: fig. 91.--to illustrate the loss of sensation produced by
division of the median nerve. the area of complete cutaneous
insensibility is shaded black. the parts insensitive to light touch and
to intermediate degrees of temperature are enclosed within the dotted
line.

(after head and sherren.)]

#the median nerve# is most frequently injured in wounds made by broken
glass in the region of the wrist. it may also be injured in fractures of
the lower end of the humerus, in fractures of both bones of the forearm,
and as a result of pressure by splints. after _division at the elbow_,
there is impairment of mobility which affects the thumb, and to a less
extent the index finger: the terminal phalanx of the thumb cannot be
flexed owing to the paralysis of the flexor pollicis longus, and the
index can only be flexed at its metacarpo-phalangeal joint by the
interosseous muscles attached to it. pronation of the forearm is feeble,
and is completed by the weight of the hand. after _division at the
wrist_, the abductor-opponens group of muscles and the two lateral
lumbricals only are affected; the abduction of the thumb can be feebly
imitated by the short extensor and the long abductor (ext. ossis
metacarpi pollicis), while opposition may be simulated by contraction of
the long flexor and the short abductor of the thumb; the paralysis of
the two medial lumbricals produces no symptoms that can be recognised.
it is important to remember that when the median nerve is divided at the
wrist, deep touch can be appreciated over the whole of the area
supplied by the nerve; the injury, therefore, is liable to be over
looked. if, however, the tendons are divided as well as the nerve, there
is insensibility to deep touch. the areas of epicritic and of
protopathic insensibility are illustrated in fig. 91. the division of
the nerve at the elbow, or even at the axilla, does not increase the
extent of the loss of epicritic or protopathic sensibility, but usually
affects deep sensibility.

[illustration: fig. 92.--to illustrate loss of sensation produced by
complete division of ulnar nerve. loss of all forms of cutaneous
sensibility is represented by the shaded area. the parts insensitive to
light touch and to intermediate degrees of heat and cold are enclosed
within the dotted line.

(head and sherren.)]

#the ulnar nerve.#--the most common injury of this nerve is its division
in transverse accidental wounds just above the wrist. in the arm it may
be contused, along with the radial, in crutch paralysis; in the region
of the elbow it may be injured in fractures or dislocations, or it may
be accidentally divided in the operation for excising the elbow-joint.

when it is injured _at or above the elbow_, there is paralysis of the
flexor carpi ulnaris, the ulnar half of the flexor digitorum profundus,
all the interossei, the two medial lumbricals, and the adductors of the
thumb. the hand assumes a characteristic attitude: the index and middle
fingers are extended at the metacarpo-phalangeal joints owing to
paralysis of the interosseous muscles attached to them; the little and
ring fingers are hyper-extended at these joints in consequence of the
paralysis of the lumbricals; all the fingers are flexed at the
inter-phalangeal joints, the flexion being most marked in the little and
ring fingers--claw-hand or _main en griffe_. on flexing the wrist, the
hand is tilted to the radial side, but the paralysis of the flexor carpi
ulnaris is often compensated for by the action of the palmaris longus.
the little and ring fingers can be flexed to a slight degree by the
slips of the flexor sublimis attached to them and supplied by the median
nerve; flexion of the terminal phalanx of the little finger is almost
impossible. adduction and abduction movements of the fingers are lost.
adduction of the thumb is carried out, not by the paralysed adductor
pollicis, but the movement may be simulated by the long flexor and
extensor muscles of the thumb. epicritic sensibility is lost over the
little finger, the ulnar half of the ring finger, and that part of the
palm and dorsum of the hand to the ulnar side of a line drawn
longitudinally through the ring finger and continued upwards.
protopathic sensibility is lost over an area which varies in different
cases. deep sensibility is usually lost over an area almost as extensive
as that of protopathic insensibility.

when the nerve is _divided at the wrist_, the adjacent tendons are also
frequently severed. if divided below the point at which its dorsal
branch is given off, the sensory paralysis is much less marked, and the
injury is therefore liable to be overlooked until the wasting of muscles
and typical _main en griffe_ ensue. the loss of sensibility after
division of the nerve before the dorsal branch is given off resembles
that after division at the elbow, except that in uncomplicated cases
deep sensibility is usually retained. if the tendons are divided as
well, however, deep touch is also lost.

care must be taken in all these injuries to prevent deformity; a splint
must be worn, at least during the night, until the muscles regain their
power of voluntary movement, and then exercises should be instituted.

#dislocation of the ulnar nerve# at the elbow results from sudden and
violent flexion of the joint, the muscular effort causing stretching or
laceration of the fascia that holds the nerve in its groove; it is
predisposed to if the groove is shallow as a result of imperfect
development of the medial condyle of the humerus, and by cubitus valgus.

the nerve slips forward, and may be felt lying on the medial aspect of
the condyle. it may retain this position, or it may slip backwards and
forwards with the movements of the arm. the symptoms at the time of the
displacement are some disability at the elbow, and pain and tingling
along the nerve, which are exaggerated by movement and by pressure. the
symptoms may subside altogether, or a neuritis may develop, with severe
pain shooting up the nerve.

the dislocated nerve is easily replaced, but is difficult to retain in
position. in recent cases the arm may be placed in the extended position
with a pad over the condyle, care being taken to avoid pressure on the
nerve. failing relief, it is better to make a bed for the nerve by
dividing the deep fascia behind the medial condyle and to stitch the
edges of the fascia over the nerve. this operation has been successful
in all the recorded cases.

#the sciatic nerve.#--when this nerve is compressed, as by sitting on a
fence, there is tingling and powerlessness in the limb as a whole, known
as "sleeping" of the limb, but these phenomena are evanescent. _injuries
to the great sciatic nerve_ are rare except in war. partial division is
more common than complete, and it is noteworthy that the fibres destined
for the peroneal nerve are more often and more severely injured than
those for the tibial (internal popliteal). after complete division, all
the muscles of the leg are paralysed; if the section is in the upper
part of the thigh, the hamstrings are also paralysed. the limb is at
first quite powerless, but the patient usually recovers sufficiently to
be able to walk with a little support, and although the hamstrings are
paralysed the knee can be flexed by the sartorius and gracilis. the
chief feature is drop-foot. there is also loss of sensation below the
knee except along the course of the long saphenous nerve on the medial
side of the leg and foot. sensibility to deep touch is only lost over a
comparatively small area on the dorsum of the foot.

#the common peroneal (external popliteal) nerve# is exposed to injury
where it winds round the neck of the fibula, because it is superficial
and lies against the unyielding bone. it may be compressed by a
tourniquet, or it may be bruised or torn in fractures of the upper end
of the bone. it has been divided in accidental wounds,--by a scythe, for
example,--in incising for cellulitis, and in performing subcutaneous
tenotomy of the biceps tendon. cases have been observed of paralysis of
the nerve as a result of prolonged acute flexion of the knee in certain
occupations.

when the nerve is divided, the most obvious result is "drop-foot"; the
patient is unable to dorsiflex the foot and cannot lift his toes off the
ground, so that in walking he is obliged to jerk the foot forwards and
laterally. the loss of sensibility depends upon whether the nerve is
divided above or below the origin of the large cutaneous branch which
comes off just before it passes round the neck of the fibula. in course
of time the foot becomes inverted and the toes are pointed--pes
equino-varus--and trophic sores are liable to form.

#the tibial (internal popliteal) nerve# is rarely injured.

#the cranial nerves# are considered with affections of the head and neck
(vol. ii.).


neuralgia

the term neuralgia is applied clinically to any pain which follows the
course of a nerve, and is not referable to any discoverable cause. it
should not be applied to pain which results from pressure on a nerve by
a tumour, a mass of callus, an aneurysm, or by any similar gross lesion.
we shall only consider here those forms of neuralgia which are amenable
to surgical treatment.

#brachial neuralgia.#--the pain is definitely located in the
distribution of one of the branches or nerve roots, is often
intermittent, and is usually associated with tingling and disturbance of
tactile sensation. the root of the neck should be examined to exclude
pressure as the cause of the pain by a cervical rib, a tumour, or an
aneurysm. when medical treatment fails, the nerve-trunks may be injected
with saline solution or recourse may be had to operative measures, the
affected cords being exposed and stretched through an incision in the
posterior triangle of the neck. if this fails to give relief, the more
serious operation of resecting the posterior roots of the affected
nerves within the vertebral canal may be considered.

_neuralgia of the sciatic nerve_--#sciatica#--is the most common form of
neuralgia met with in surgical practice.

it is chiefly met with in adults of gouty or rheumatic tendencies who
suffer from indigestion, constipation, and oxaluria--in fact, the same
type of patients who are liable to lumbago, and the two affections are
frequently associated. in hospital practice it is commonly met with in
coal-miners and others who assume a squatting position at work. the
onset of the pain may follow over-exertion and exposure to cold and wet,
especially in those who do not take regular exercise. any error of diet
or indulgence in beer or wine may contribute to its development.

the essential symptom is paroxysmal or continuous pain along the course
of the nerve in the buttock, thigh, or leg. it may be comparatively
slight, or it may be so severe as to prevent sleep. it is aggravated by
movement, so that the patient walks lame or is obliged to lie up. it is
aggravated also by any movement which tends to put the nerve on the
stretch, as in bending down to put on the shoes, such movements also
causing tingling down the nerve, and sometimes numbness in the foot.
this may be demonstrated by flexing the thigh on the abdomen, the knee
being kept extended; there is no pain if the same manoeuvre is repeated
with the knee flexed. the nerve is sensitive to pressure, the most
tender points being its emergence from the greater sciatic foramen, the
hollow between the trochanter and the ischial tuberosity, and where the
common peroneal nerve winds round the neck of the fibula. the muscles of
the thigh are often wasted and are liable to twitch.

the clinical features vary a good deal in different cases; the affection
is often obstinate, and may last for many weeks or even months.

in the sciatica that results from neuritis and perineuritis, there is
marked tenderness on pressure due to the involvement of the nerve
filaments in the sheath of the nerve, and there may be patches of
cutaneous anaesthesia, loss of tendon reflexes, localised wasting of
muscles, and vaso-motor and trophic changes. the presence of the
reaction of degeneration confirms the diagnosis of neuritis. in
long-standing cases the pain and discomfort may lead to a postural
scoliosis (_ischias-scoliotica_).

_diagnosis._--pain referred along the course of the sciatic nerve on one
side, or, as is sometimes the case, on both sides, is a symptom of
tumours of the uterus, the rectum, or the pelvic bones. it may result
also from the pressure of an abscess or an aneurysm either inside the
pelvis or in the buttock, and is sometimes associated with disease of
the spinal medulla, such as tabes. gluteal fibrositis may be mistaken
for sciatica. it is also necessary to exclude such conditions as disease
in the hip or sacro-iliac joint, especially tuberculous disease and
arthritis deformans, before arriving at a diagnosis of sciatica. a
digital examination of the rectum or vagina is of great value in
excluding intra-pelvic tumours.

_treatment_ is both general and local. any constitutional tendency, such
as gout or rheumatism, must be counteracted, and indigestion, oxaluria,
and constipation should receive appropriate treatment. in acute cases
the patient is confined to bed between blankets, the limb is wrapped in
thermogene wool, and the knee is flexed over a pillow; in some cases
relief is experienced from the use of a long splint, or slinging the leg
in a salter's cradle. a rubber hot-bottle may be applied over the seat
of greatest pain. the bowels should be well opened by castor oil or by
calomel followed by a saline. salicylate of soda in full doses, or
aspirin, usually proves effectual in relieving pain, but when this is
very intense it may call for injections of heroin or morphin. potassium
iodide is of benefit in chronic cases.

relief usually results from bathing, douching, and massage, and from
repeated gentle stretching of the nerve. this may be carried out by
passive movements of the limb--the hip being flexed while the knee is
kept extended; and by active movements--the patient flexing the limb at
the hip, the knee being maintained in the extended position. these
exercises, which may be preceded by massage, are carried out night and
morning, and should be practised systematically by those who are liable
to sciatica.

benefit has followed the injection into the nerve itself, or into the
tissues surrounding it, of normal saline solution; from 70-100 c.c. are
injected at one time. if the pain recurs, the injection may require to
be repeated on many occasions at different points up and down the nerve.
needling or acupuncture consists in piercing the nerve at intervals in
the buttock and thigh with long steel needles. six or eight needles are
inserted and left in position for from fifteen to thirty minutes.

in obstinate and severe cases the nerve may be _forcibly stretched_.
this may be done bloodlessly by placing the patient on his back with the
hip flexed to a right angle, and then gradually extending the knee until
it is in a straight line with the thigh (billroth). a general anaesthetic
is usually required. a more effectual method is to expose the nerve
through an incision at the fold of the buttock, and forcibly pull upon
it. this operation is most successful when the pain is due to the nerve
being involved in adhesions.

#trigeminal neuralgia.#--a severe form of epileptiform neuralgia occurs
in the branches of the fifth nerve, and is one of the most painful
affections to which human flesh is liable. so far as its pathology is
known, it is believed to be due to degenerative changes in the semilunar
(gasserian) ganglion. it is met with in adults, is almost invariably
unilateral, and develops without apparent cause. the pain, which occurs
in paroxysms, is at first of moderate severity, but gradually becomes
agonising. in the early stages the paroxysms occur at wide intervals,
but later they recur with such frequency as to be almost continuous.
they are usually excited by some trivial cause, such as moving the jaws
in eating or speaking, touching the face as in washing, or exposure to a
draught of cold air. between the paroxysms the patient is free from
pain, but is in constant terror of its return, and the face wears an
expression of extreme suffering and anxiety. when the paroxysm is
accompanied by twitching of the facial muscles, it is called _spasmodic
tic_.

the skin of the affected area may be glazed and red, or may be pale and
moist with inspissated sweat, the patient not daring to touch or wash
it.

there is excessive tenderness at the points of emergence of the
different branches on the face, and pressure over one or other of these
points may excite a paroxysm. in typical cases the patient is unable to
take any active part in life. the attempt to eat is attended with such
severe pain that he avoids taking food. in some cases the suffering is
so great that the patient only obtains sleep by the use of hypnotics,
and he is often on the verge of suicide.

_diagnosis._--there is seldom any difficulty in recognising the disease.
it is important, however, to exclude the hysterical form of neuralgia,
which is characterised by its occurrence earlier in life, by the pain
varying in situation, being frequently bilateral, and being more often
constant than paroxysmal.

_treatment._--before having recourse to the measures described below, it
is advisable to give a thorough trial to the medical measures used in
the treatment of neuralgia.

_the injection of alcohol into the nerve._--the alcohol acts by
destroying the nerve fibres, and must be brought into direct contact
with them; if the nerve has been properly struck the injection is
followed by complete anaesthesia in the distribution of the nerve. the
relief may last for from six months to three years; if the pain returns,
the injection may be repeated. the strength of the alcohol should be 85
per cent., and the amount injected about 2 c.c.; a general, or
preferably a local, anaesthetic (novocain) should be employed
(schlosser); the needle is 8 cm. long, and 0.7 mm. in diameter. the
severe pain which the alcohol causes may be lessened, after the needle
has penetrated to the necessary depth, by passing a few cubic
centimetres of a 2 per cent. solution of _novocain-suprarenin_ through
it before the alcohol is injected. the treatment by injection of alcohol
is superior to the resection of branches of the nerve, for though
relapses occur after the treatment with alcohol, renewed freedom from
pain may be obtained by its repetition. the ophthalmic division should
not, however, be treated in this manner, for the alcohol may escape into
the orbit and endanger other nerves in this region. harris recommends
the injection of alcohol into the semilunar ganglion.

_operative treatment._--this consists in the removal of the affected
nerve or nerves, either by resection--_neurectomy_; or by a combination
of resection with twisting or tearing of the nerve from its central
connections--_avulsion_. to prevent the regeneration of the nerve after
these operations, the canal of exit through the bone should be
obliterated; this is best accomplished by a silver screw-nail driven
home by an ordinary screw-driver (charles h. mayo).

when the neuralgia involves branches of two or of all three trunks, or
when it has recurred after temporary relief following resection of
individual branches, the _removal of the semilunar ganglion_, along with
the main trunks of the maxillary and mandibular divisions, should be
considered.

the operation is a difficult and serious one, but the results are
satisfactory so far as the cure of the neuralgia is concerned. there is
little or no disability from the unilateral paralysis of the muscles of
mastication; but on account of the insensitiveness of the cornea, the
eye must be protected from irritation, especially during the first month
or two after the operation; this may be done by fixing a large
watch-glass around the edge of the orbit with adhesive plaster.

if the ophthalmic branch is not involved, neither it nor the ganglion
should be interfered with; the maxillary and mandibular divisions should
be divided within the skull, and the foramen rotundum and foramen ovale
obliterated.

    of scars_--_keloid_--_tumours_--affections of nails.

#structure of skin.#--the skin is composed of a superficial cellular
layer--the epidermis, and the corium or true skin. the _epidermis_ is
differentiated from without inwards into the stratum corneum, the
stratum lucidum, the stratum granulosum, and the rete malpighii or
germinal layer, from which all the others are developed. the _corium_ or
_true skin_ consists of connective tissue, in which ramify the blood
vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. that part of the corium immediately
adjoining the epidermis is known as the papillary portion, and contains
the terminal loops of the cutaneous blood vessels and the terminations
of the cutaneous nerves. the deeper portion of the true skin is known as
the reticular portion, and is largely composed of adipose tissue.

#blisters# result from the exudation of serous fluid beneath the horny
layer of the epidermis. the fluid may be clear, as in the blisters of a
recent burn, or blood-stained, as in the blisters commonly accompanying
fractures of the leg. it may become purulent as a result of infection,
and this may be the starting-point of lymphangitis or cellulitis.

the skin should be disinfected and the blisters punctured. when
infected, the separated horny layer must be cut away with scissors to
allow of the necessary purification.

#callosities# are prominent, indurated masses of the horny layer of the
epidermis, where it has been exposed to prolonged friction and pressure.
they occur on the fingers and hand as a result of certain occupations
and sports, but are most common under the balls of the toes or heel. a
bursa may form beneath a callosity, and if it becomes inflamed may cause
considerable suffering; if suppuration ensues, a sinus may form,
resembling a perforating ulcer of the foot.

the _treatment_ of callosities on the foot consists in removing pressure
by wearing properly fitting boots, and in applying a ring pad around the
callosity; another method is to fit a sock of spongiopilene with a hole
cut out opposite the callosity. after soaking in hot water, the
overgrown horny layer is pared away, and the part painted daily with a
saturated solution of salicylic acid in flexile collodion.

[illustration: fig. 93.--callosities and corns on the sole and plantar
aspect of the toes in a woman who was also the subject of flat-foot.]

#corns.#--a corn is a localised overgrowth of the horny layer of the
epidermis, which grows downwards, pressing upon and displacing the
sensitive papillae of the corium. corns are due to the friction and
pressure of ill-fitting boots, and are met with chiefly on the toes and
sole of the foot. a corn is usually hard, dry, and white; but it may be
sodden from moisture, as in "soft corns" between the toes. a bursa may
form beneath a corn, and if inflamed constitutes one form of bunion.
when suppuration takes place in relation to a corn, there is great pain
and disability, and it may prove the starting-point of lymphangitis.

the _treatment_ consists in the wearing of properly fitting boots and
stockings, and, if the symptoms persist, the corn should be removed.
this is done after the manner of chiropodists by digging out the corn
with a suitably shaped knife. a more radical procedure is to excise,
under local anaesthesia, the portion of skin containing the corn and
the underlying bursa. the majority of so-called corn solvents consist of
a solution of salicylic acid in collodion; if this is painted on daily,
the epidermis dies and can then be pared away. the unskilful paring of
corns may determine the occurrence of senile gangrene in those who are
predisposed to it by disease of the arteries.

[illustration: fig. 94.--ulcerated chilblains on fingers of a child.]

#chilblains.#--chilblain or _erythema pernio_ is a vascular disturbance
resulting from the alternate action of cold and heat on the distal parts
of the body. chilblains are met with chiefly on the fingers and toes in
children and anaemic girls. in the mild form there is a sensation of
burning and itching, the part becomes swollen, of a dusky red colour,
and the skin is tense and shiny. in more severe cases the burning and
itching are attended with pain, and the skin becomes of a violet or
wine-red colour. there is a third degree, closely approaching
frost-bite, in which the skin tends to blister and give way, leaving an
indolent raw surface popularly known as a "broken chilblain."

those liable to chilblains should take open-air exercise, nourishing
food, cod-liver oil, and tonics. woollen stockings and gloves should be
worn in cold weather, and sudden changes of temperature avoided. the
symptoms may be relieved by ichthyol ointment, glycerin and belladonna,
or a mixture of venice turpentine, castor oil, and collodion applied on
lint which is wrapped round the toe. another favourite application is
one of equal parts of tincture of capsicum and compound liniment of
camphor, painted over the area night and morning. balsam of peru or
resin ointment spread on gauze should be applied to broken chilblains.
the most effective treatment is bier's bandage applied for about six
hours twice daily; it can be worn while the patient is following his
occupation; in chronic cases this may be supplemented with hot-air
baths.

#boils and carbuncles.#--these result from infection with the
staphylococcus aureus, which enters the orifices of the ducts of the
skin under the influence of friction and pressure, as was demonstrated
by the well-known experiment of garre, who produced a crop of pustules
and boils on his own forearm by rubbing in a culture of the
staphylococcus aureus.

a #boil# results when the infection is located in a hair follicle or
sebaceous gland. a hard, painful, conical swelling develops, to which,
so long as the skin retains its normal appearance, the term "blind
boil" is applied. usually, however, the skin becomes red, and after a
time breaks, giving exit to a drop or two of thick pus. after an
interval of from six to ten days a soft white slough is discharged; this
is known as the "core," and consists of the necrosed hair follicle or
sebaceous gland. after the separation of the core the boil heals
rapidly, leaving a small depressed scar.

boils are most frequently met with on the back of the neck and the
buttocks, and on other parts where the skin is coarse and thick and is
exposed to friction and pressure. the occurrence of a number or a
succession of boils is due to spread of the infection, the cocci from
the original boil obtaining access to adjacent hair follicles. the
spread of boils may be unwittingly promoted by the use of a domestic
poultice or the wearing of infected underclothing.

while boils are frequently met with in debilitated persons, and
particularly in those suffering from diabetes or bright's disease, they
also occur in those who enjoy vigorous health. they seldom prove
dangerous to life except in diabetic subjects, but when they occur on
the face there is a risk of lymphatic and of general pyogenic infection.
boils may be differentiated from syphilitic lesions of the skin by
their acute onset and progress, and by the absence of other evidence of
syphilis; and from the malignant or anthrax pustule by the absence of
the central black eschar and of the circumstances which attend upon
anthrax infection.

_treatment._--the skin of the affected area should be painted with
iodine, and a klapp's suction bell applied thrice daily. if pus forms,
the skin is frozen with ethyl-chloride and a small incision made, after
which the application of the suction bell is persevered with. the
further treatment consists in the use of diluted boracic or resin
ointment. in multiple boils on the trunk and limbs, lysol or boracic
baths are of service; the underclothing should be frequently changed,
and that which is discarded must be disinfected. in patients with
recurrence of boils about the neck, re-infection frequently takes place
from the scalp, to which therefore treatment should be directed.

any impaired condition of health should be corrected; when, there is
sugar or albumen in the urine the conditions on which these depend must
receive appropriate treatment. when there are successive crops of boils,
recourse should be had to vaccines. in refractory cases benefit has
followed the subcutaneous injection of lipoid solution containing tin.

#carbuncle# may be looked upon as an aggregation of boils, and is
characterised by a densely hard base and a brownish-red discoloration of
the skin. it is usually about the size of a crown-piece, but it may
continue to enlarge until it attains the size of a dinner-plate. the
patient is ill and feverish, and the pain may be so severe as to prevent
sleep. as time goes on several points of suppuration appear, and when
these burst there are formed a number of openings in the skin, giving it
a cribriform appearance; these openings exude pus. the different
openings ultimately fuse and the large adherent greyish-white slough is
exposed. the separation of the slough is a tedious process, and the
patient may become exhausted by pain, discharge, and toxin absorption.
when the slough is finally thrown off, a deep gap is left, which takes a
long time to heal. a large carbuncle is a grave disease, especially in a
weakly person suffering from diabetes or chronic alcoholism; we have on
several occasions seen diabetic coma supervene and the patient die
without recovering consciousness. in the majority of cases the patient
is laid aside for several months. it is most common in male adults over
forty years of age, and is usually situated on the back between the
shoulders. when it occurs on the face or anterior part of the neck it is
especially dangerous, because of the greater risk of dissemination of
the infection.

a carbuncle is to be differentiated from an ulcerated gumma and from
anthrax pustule.

[illustration: fig. 95.--carbuncle of seventeen days' duration in a
woman aet. 57.]

_treatment._--pain is relieved by full doses of opium or codein, and
these drugs are specially indicated when sugar is present in the urine.
vaccines may be given a trial. the diet should be liberal and easily
digested, and strychnin and other stimulants may be of service. locally
the treatment is carried out on the same lines as for boils.

in some cases it is advisable to excise the carbuncle or to make
incisions across it in different directions, so that the resulting wound
presents a stellate appearance.

#acute abscesses of the skin and subcutaneous tissue in young
children.#--in young infants, abscesses are not infrequently met with
scattered over the trunk and limbs, and are probably the result of
infection of the sebaceous glands from dirty underclothing. the
abscesses should be opened, and the further spread of infection
prevented by cleansing of the skin and by the use of clean under-linen.
similar abscesses are met with on the scalp in association with eczema,
impetigo, and pediculosis.

#veldt sore.#--this sore usually originates in an abrasion of the
epidermis, such as a sun blister, the bite of an insect, or a scratch. a
pustule forms and bursts, and a brownish-yellow scab forms over it. when
this is removed, an ulcer is left which has little tendency to heal.
these sores are most common about the hands, arms, neck, and feet, and
are most apt to occur in those who have had no opportunities of washing,
and who have lived for a long time on tinned foods.

#tuberculosis of the skin.#--interest attaches chiefly to the primary
forms of tuberculosis of the skin in which the bacilli penetrate from
without--inoculation tubercle and lupus.

#inoculation tubercle.#--the appearances vary with the conditions under
which the inoculation takes place. as observed on the fingers of adults,
the affection takes the form of an indolent painless swelling, the
epidermis being red and glazed, or warty, and irregularly fissured.
sometimes the epidermis gives way, forming an ulcer with flabby
granulations. the infection rarely spreads to the lymphatics, but we
have seen inoculation tubercle of the index-finger followed by a large
cold abscess on the median side of the upper arm and by a huge mass of
breaking down glands in the axilla.

in children who run about barefooted in towns, tubercle may be
inoculated into wounds in the sole or about the toes, and although the
local appearances may not be characteristic, the nature of the infection
is revealed by its tendency to spread up the limb along the lymph
vessels, giving rise to abscesses and fungating ulcers in relation to
the femoral glands.

#tuberculous lupus.#--this is an extremely chronic affection of the
skin. it rarely extends to the lymph glands, and of all tuberculous
lesions is the least dangerous to life. the commonest form of
lupus--_lupus vulgaris_--usually commences in childhood or youth, and is
most often met with on the nose or cheek. the early and typical
appearance is that of brownish-yellow or pink nodules in the skin, about
the size of hemp seed. healing frequently occurs in the centre of the
affected area while the disease continues to extend at the margin.

when there is actual destruction of tissue and ulceration--the so-called
"_lupus excedens_" or "_ulcerans_"--healing is attended with
cicatricial contraction, which may cause unsightly deformity. when the
cheek is affected, the lower eyelid may be drawn down and everted; when
the lips are affected, the mouth may be distorted or seriously
diminished in size. when the nose is attacked, both the skin and mucous
surfaces are usually involved, and the nasal orifices may be narrowed or
even obliterated; sometimes the soft parts, including the cartilages,
are destroyed, leaving only the bones covered by tightly stretched scar
tissue.

the disease progresses slowly, healing in some places and spreading at
others. the patient complains of a burning sensation, but little of
pain, and is chiefly concerned about the disfigurement. nothing is more
characteristic of lupus than the appearance of fresh nodules in parts
which have already healed. in the course of years large tracts of the
face and neck may become affected. from the lips it may spread to the
gum and palate, giving to the mucous membrane the appearance of a
raised, bright-red, papillary or villous surface. when the disease
affects the gums, the teeth may become loose and fall out.

[illustration: fig. 96.--tuberculous elephantiasis in a woman aet. 35.]

on parts of the body other than the face, the disease is even more
chronic, and is often attended with a considerable production of dense
fibrous tissue--the so-called _fibroid lupus_. sometimes there is a
warty thickening of the epidermis--_lupus verrucosus_. in the fingers
and toes it may lead to a progressive destruction of tissue like that
observed in leprosy, and from the resulting loss of portions of the
digits it has been called _lupus mutilans_. in the lower extremity a
remarkable form of the disease is sometimes met with, to which the term
_lupus elephantiasis_ (fig. 96) has been applied. it commences as an
ordinary lupus of the toes or dorsum of the foot, from which the
tuberculous infection spreads to the lymph vessels, and the limb as a
whole becomes enormously swollen and unshapely.

finally, a long-standing lupus, especially on the cheek, may become the
seat of epithelioma--_lupus epithelioma_--usually of the exuberant or
cauliflower type, which, like other epitheliomas that originate in scar
tissue, presents little tendency to infect the lymphatics.

the _diagnosis_ of lupus is founded on the chronic progress and long
duration, and the central scarring with peripheral extension of the
disease. on the face it is most liable to be confused with syphilis and
with rodent cancer. the syphilitic lesion belongs to the tertiary
period, and although presenting a superficial resemblance to
tuberculosis, its progress is more rapid, so that within a few months it
may involve an area of skin as wide as would be affected by lupus in as
many years. further, it readily yields to anti-syphilitic treatment. in
cases of tertiary syphilis in which the nose is destroyed, it will be
noticed that the bones have suffered most, while in lupus the
destruction of tissue involves chiefly the soft parts.

rodent cancer is liable to be mistaken for lupus, because it affects the
same parts of the face; it is equally chronic, and may partly heal. it
begins later in life, however, the margin of the ulcer is more sharply
defined, and often presents a "rolled" appearance.

_treatment._--when the disease is confined to a limited area, the most
rapid and certain cure is obtained by _excision_; larger areas are
scraped with the sharp spoon. the _ray treatment_ includes the use of
luminous, rontgen, or radium rays, and possesses the advantage of being
comparatively painless and of being followed by the least amount of
scarring and deformity.

encouraging results have also been obtained by the application of carbon
dioxide snow.

#multiple subcutaneous tuberculous nodules# are met with chiefly in
children. they are indolent and painless, and rarely attract attention
until they break down and form abscesses, which are usually about the
size of a cherry, and when these burst sinuses or ulcers result. if the
overlying skin is still intact, the best treatment is excision. if the
abscess has already infected the skin, each focus should be scraped and
packed.

#sporotrichosis# is a mycotic infection due to the sporothrix shenkii.
it presents so many features resembling syphilis and tubercle that it is
frequently mistaken for one or other of these affections. it occurs
chiefly in males between fifteen and forty-five, who are farmers, fruit
and vegetable dealers, or florists. there is usually a history of trauma
of the nature of a scratch or a cut, and after a long incubation period
there develop a series of small, hard, round nodules in the skin and
subcutaneous tissue which, without pain or temperature, soften into
cold abscesses and leave indolent ulcers or sinuses. the infection is
of slow progress and follows the course of the lymphatics. from the
gelatinous pus the organism is cultivated without difficulty, and this
is the essential step in arriving at a diagnosis. the disease yields in
a few weeks to full doses of iodide of potassium.

#elephantiasis.#--this term is applied to an excessive enlargement of a
part depending upon an overgrowth of the skin and subcutaneous cellular
tissue, and it may result from a number of causes, acting independently
or in combination. the condition is observed chiefly in the extremities
and in the external organs of generation.

_elephantiasis from lymphatic or venous obstruction._--of this the
best-known example is _tropical elephantiasis_ (e. arabum), which is
endemic in samoa, barbadoes, and other places. it attacks the lower
extremity or the genitals in either sex (figs. 97, 98). the disease is
usually ushered in with fever, and signs of lymphangitis in the part
affected. after a number of such attacks, the lymph vessels appear to
become obliterated, and the skin and subcutaneous cellular tissue, being
bathed in stagnant lymph--which possibly contains the products of
streptococci--take on an overgrowth, which continues until the part
assumes gigantic proportions. in certain cases the lymph trunks have
been found to be blocked with the parent worms of the filaria bancrofti.
cases of elephantiasis of the lower extremity are met with in this
country in which there are no filarial parasites in the lymph vessels,
and these present features closely resembling the tropical variety, and
usually follow upon repeated attacks of lymphangitis or erysipelas.

the part affected is enormously increased in size, and causes
inconvenience from its bulk and weight. in contrast to ordinary dropsy,
there is no pitting on pressure, and the swelling does not disappear on
elevation of the limb. the skin becomes rough and warty, and may hang
down in pendulous folds. blisters form on the surface and yield an
abundant exudate of clear lymph. from neglect of cleanliness, the skin
becomes the seat of eczema or even of ulceration attended with foul
discharge.

samson handley has sought to replace the blocked lymph vessels by
burying in the subcutaneous tissue of the swollen part a number of stout
silk threads--_lymphangioplasty_. by their capillary action they drain
the lymph to a healthy region above, and thus enable it to enter the
circulation. it has been more successful in the face and upper limb than
in the lower extremity. if the tissues are infected with pus organisms,
a course of vaccines should precede the operation.

[illustration: fig. 97.--elephantiasis in a woman aet. 45.]

a similar type of elephantiasis may occur after extirpation of the lymph
glands in the axilla or groin; in the leg in long-standing standing
varix and phlebitis with chronic ulcer; in the arm as a result of
extensive cancerous disease of the lymphatics in the axilla secondarily
to cancer of the breast; and in extensive tuberculous disease of the
lymphatics. the last-named is chiefly observed in the lower limb in
young adult women, and from its following upon lupus of the toes or foot
it has been called _lupus elephantiasis_. the tuberculous infection
spreads slowly up the limb by way of the lymph vessels, and as these are
obliterated the skin and cellular tissues become hypertrophied, and the
surface is studded over with fungating tuberculous masses of a livid
blue colour. as the more severe forms of the disease may prove dangerous
to life by pyogenic complications inducing gangrene of the limb, the
question of amputation may have to be considered.

[illustration: fig. 98.--elephantiasis of penis and scrotum in native of
demerara.

(mr. annandale's case.)]

belonging to this group also is a form of _congenital elephantiasis_
resulting from the circular constriction of a limb _in utero_ by
amniotic bands.

_elephantiasis occurring apart from lymphatic or venous obstruction_ is
illustrated by _elephantiasis nervorum_, in which there is an overgrowth
of the skin and cellular tissue of an extremity in association with
neuro-fibromatosis of the cutaneous nerves (fig. 89); and by
_elephantiasis graecorum_--a form of leprosy in which the skin of the
face becomes the seat of tumour-like masses consisting of leprous
nodules. it is also illustrated by _elephantiasis involving the scrotum_
as a result of prolonged irritation by the urine in cases in which the
penis has been amputated and the urine has infiltrated the scrotal
tissues over a period of years.

#sebaceous cysts.#--atheromatous cysts or wens are formed in relation to
the sebaceous glands and hair follicles. they are commonly met with in
adults, on the scalp (fig. 99), face, neck, back, and external genitals.
sometimes they are multiple, and they may be met with in several members
of the same family. they are smooth, rounded, or discoid cysts, varying
in size from a split-pea to a tangerine orange. in consistence they are
firm and elastic, or fluctuating, and are incorporated with the
overlying skin, but movable on the deeper structures. the orifice of the
partly blocked sebaceous follicle is sometimes visible, and the contents
of the cyst can be squeezed through the opening. the wall of the cyst is
composed of a connective-tissue capsule lined by stratified squamous
epithelium. the contents consist of accumulated epithelial cells, and
are at first dry and pearly white in appearance, but as a result of
fatty degeneration they break down into a greyish-yellow pultaceous and
semi-fluid material having a peculiar stale odour. it is probable that
the decomposition of the contents is the result of the presence of
bacteria, and that from the surgical point of view they should be
regarded as infective. a sebaceous cyst may remain indefinitely without
change, or may slowly increase in size, the skin over it becoming
stretched and closely adherent to the cyst wall as a result of friction
and pressure. the contents may ooze from the orifice of the duct and dry
on the skin surface, leading to the formation of a sebaceous horn
(fig. 100). as a result of injury the cyst may undergo sudden
enlargement from haemorrhage into its interior.

recurrent attacks of inflammation frequently occur, especially in wens
of the face and scalp. suppuration may ensue and be followed by cure of
the cyst, or an offensive fungating ulcer forms which may be mistaken
for epithelioma. true cancerous transformation is rare.

wens are to be _diagnosed_ from dermoids, from fatty tumours, and from
cold abscesses. dermoids usually appear before adult life, and as they
nearly always lie beneath the fascia, the skin is movable over them. a
fatty tumour is movable, and is often lobulated. the confusion with a
cold abscess is most likely to occur in wens of the neck or back, and it
may be impossible without the use of an exploring needle to
differentiate between them.

[illustration: fig. 99.--multiple sebaceous cysts or wens; the larger
ones are of many years' duration.]

_treatment._--the removal of wens is to be recommended while they are
small and freely movable, as they are then easily shelled out after
incising the overlying skin; sometimes splitting the cyst makes its
removal easier. local anaesthesia is to be preferred. it is important
that none of the cyst wall be left behind. in large and adherent wens an
ellipse of skin is removed along with the cyst. when inflamed, it may be
impossible to dissect out the cyst, and the wall should be destroyed
with carbolic acid, the resulting wound being treated by the open
method.

#moles.#--the term mole is applied to a pigmented, and usually hairy,
patch of skin, present at or appearing shortly after birth. the colour
varies from brown to black, according to the amount of melanin pigment
present. the lesion consists in an overgrowth of epidermis which often
presents an alveolar arrangement. moles vary greatly in size: some are
mere dots, others are as large as the palm of the hand, and occasionally
a mole covers half the face. in addition to being unsightly, they bleed
freely when abraded, are liable to ulcerate from friction and pressure,
and occasionally become the starting-point of melanotic cancer. rodent
cancer sometimes originates in the slightly pigmented moles met with on
the face. overgrowths in relation to the cutaneous nerves, especially
the plexiform neuroma, occasionally originate in pigmented moles. soldau
believes that the pigmentation and overgrowth of the epidermis in moles
are associated with, and probably result from, a fibromatosis of the
cutaneous nerves.

_treatment._--the quickest way to get rid of a mole is to excise it; if
the edges of the gap cannot be brought together with sutures, recourse
should be had to grafting. in large hairy moles of the face whose size
forbids excision, radium or the x-rays should be employed. excellent
results have been obtained by refrigeration with solid carbon dioxide.
in children and women with delicate skin, applications of from ten to
thirty seconds suffice. in persons with coarse skin an application of
one minute may be necessary, and it may have to be repeated.

#horns.#--the _sebaceous_ horn results from the accumulation of the
dried contents of a wen on the surface of the skin: the sebaceous
material after drying up becomes cornified, and as fresh material is
added to the base the horn increases in length (fig. 100). the _wart_
horn grows from a warty papilloma of the skin. _cicatrix_ horns are
formed by the heaping up of epidermis in the scars that result from
burns. _nail_ horns are overgrown nails (keratomata of the nail bed),
and are met with chiefly in the great toe of elderly bedridden patients.
if an ulcer forms at the base of a horn, it may prove the starting-point
of epithelioma, and for this reason, as well as for others, horns should
be removed.

[illustration: fig. 100.--sebaceous horn growing from auricle.

(dr. kenneth maclachan's case.)]

#new growths in the skin and subcutaneous tissue.#--the _angioma_ has
been described with diseases of blood vessels. _fibroma._--various types
of fibroma occur in the skin. a soft pedunculated fibroma, about the
size of a pea, is commonly met with, especially on the neck and trunk;
it is usually solitary, and is easily removed with scissors. the
multiple, soft fibroma known as _molluscum fibrosum_, which depends upon
a neuro-fibromatosis of the cutaneous nerves, is described with the
tumours of nerves. hard fibromas occurring singly or in groups may be
met with, especially in the skin of the buttock, and may present a local
malignancy, recurring after removal like the "recurrent fibroid" of
paget. the "painful subcutaneous nodule" is a solitary fibroma related
to one of the cutaneous nerves. the hard fibroma known as _keloid_ is
described with the affections of scars.

#papilloma.#--the _common wart_ or verruca is an outgrowth of the
surface epidermis. it may be sessile or pedunculated hard or soft. the
surface may be smooth, or fissured and foliated like a cauliflower, or
it may be divided up into a number of spines. warts are met with chiefly
on the hands, and are often multiple, occurring in clusters or in
successive crops. multiple warts appear to result from some contagion,
the nature of which is unknown; they sometimes occur in an epidemic form
among school-children, and show a remarkable tendency to disappear
spontaneously. the solitary flat-topped wart which occurs on the face
of old people may, if irritated, become the seat of epithelioma. a warty
growth of the epidermis is a frequent accompaniment of moles and of that
variety of lupus known as _lupus verrucosus_.

_treatment._--in the multiple warts of children the health should be
braced up by a change to the seaside. a dusting-powder, consisting of
boracic acid with 5 per cent. salicylic acid, may be rubbed into the
hands after washing and drying. the persistent warts of young adults
should be excised after freezing with chloride of ethyl. when cutting is
objected to, they may be painted night and morning with salicylic
collodion, the epidermis being dehydrated with alcohol before each
application.

_venereal warts_ occur on the genitals of either sex, and may form large
cauliflower-like masses on the inner surface of the prepuce or of the
labia majora. although frequently co-existing with gonorrhoea or
syphilis, they occur independently of these diseases, being probably
acquired by contact with another individual suffering from warts
(c. w. cathcart). they give rise to considerable irritation and
suffering, and when cleanliness is neglected there may be an offensive
discharge.

in the female, the cauliflower-like masses are dissected from the labia;
in the male, the prepuce is removed and the warts on the glans are
snipped off with scissors. in milder cases, the warts usually disappear
if the parts are kept absolutely dry and clean. a useful dusting-powder
is one consisting of calamine and 5 per cent. salicylic acid; the
exsiccated sulphate of iron, in the form of a powder, may be employed in
cases which resist this treatment.

#adenoma.#--this is a comparatively rare tumour growing from the glands
of the skin. one variety, known as the "tomato tumour," which apparently
originates from _the sweat glands_, is met with on the scalp and face in
women past middle life. these growths are often multiple; the individual
tumours vary in size, and the skin, which is almost devoid of hairs, is
glistening and tightly stretched over them. a similar tumour may occur
on the nose. the _sebaceous adenoma_, which originates from the
sebaceous glands, forms a projecting tumour on the face or scalp, and
when the skin is irritated it may ulcerate and fungate. the treatment
consists in the removal of the tumour along with the overlying skin.

the exuberant masses on the nose known as "rhinophyma," "lipoma nasi,"
or "potato nose" are of the nature of sebaceous adenoma, and are removed
by shaving them off with a knife until the normal shape of the nose is
restored healing takes place with remarkable rapidity.

#cancer.#--there are several types of primary cancer of the skin, the
most important being squamous epithelioma, rodent cancer, and melanotic
cancer.

[illustration: fig. 101.--paraffin epithelioma.]

#epithelioma# occurs in a variety of forms. when originating in a small
ulcer or wart-for example on the face in old people--it presents the
features of a chronic indurated ulcer. a more exuberant and rapidly
growing form of epithelial cancer, described by hutchinson as the
_crateriform ulcer_, commences on the face as a small red pimple which
rapidly develops into an elevated mass shaped like a bee-hive, and
breaks down in the centre. epithelioma may develop anywhere on the body
in relation to long-standing ulcers, especially that resulting from a
burn or from lupus; this form usually presents an exuberant outgrowth of
epidermis not unlike a cauliflower. an interesting example of
epithelioma has been described by neve of kashmir. the natives in that
province are in the habit of carrying a fire-basket suspended from the
waist, which often burns the skin and causes a chronic ulcer, and many
of these ulcers become the seat of epithelioma, due, in neve's opinion,
to the actual contact of the sooty pan with the skin.

the term _trade epithelioma_ has been applied to that form met with in
those who follow certain occupations, such as paraffin workers and
chimney-sweeps. the most recent member of this group is the _x-ray
carcinoma_, which is met with in those who are constantly exposed to the
irritation of the x-rays; there is first a chronic dermatitis with warty
overgrowth of the surface epithelium, pigmentation, and the formation of
fissures and warts. the trade epithelioma varies a good deal in
malignancy, but it tends to cause death in the same manner as other
epitheliomas.

epithelial cancer has also been observed in those who have taken arsenic
over long periods for medicinal purposes.

[illustration: fig. 102.--rodent cancer of inner canthus.]

#rodent cancer# (rodent ulcer).--this is a cancer originating in the
sweat glands or sebaceous follicles, or in the foetal residues of
cutaneous glands. the cells are small and closely packed together in
alveoli or in reticulated columns; cell nests are rare. it is remarkably
constant in its seat of origin, being nearly always located on the
lateral aspect of the nose or in the vicinity of the lower eyelid
(fig. 102). it is rare on the trunk or limbs. it commences as a small
flattened nodule in the skin, the epidermis over it being stretched and
shining. the centre becomes depressed, while the margins extend in the
form of an elevated ridge. sooner or later the epidermis gives way in
the centre, exposing a smooth raw surface devoid of granulations.

[illustration: fig. 103.--rodent cancer of fifteen years' duration,
which has destroyed the contents of the orbit.

(sir montagu cotterill's case)]

the margin, while in parts irregular, is typically represented by a
well-defined "rolled" border which consists of the peripheral portion of
the cancer that has not broken down. the central ulcer may temporarily
heal. there is itching but little pain, and the condition progresses
extremely slowly; rodent cancers which have existed for many years are
frequently met with. the disease attacks and destroys every structure
with which it comes in contact, such as the eyelids, the walls of the
nasal cavities, and the bones of the face; hence it may produce the most
hideous deformities (fig. 103). the patient may succumb to haemorrhage or
to infective complications such as erysipelas or meningitis.

secondary growths in the lymph glands, while not unknown, are extremely
rare. we have only seen them once--in a case of rodent cancer in the
groin.

_diagnosis._--lupus is the disease most often mistaken for rodent
cancer. lupus usually begins earlier in life, it presents apple-jelly
nodules, and lacks the rounded, elevated border. syphilitic lesions
progress more rapidly, and also lack the characteristic margin. the
differentiation from squamous epithelioma is of considerable importance,
as the latter affection spreads more rapidly, involves the lymph glands
early, and is much more dangerous to life.

_treatment._--in rodent cancers of limited size--say less than one inch
in diameter--free excision is the most rapid and certain method of
treatment. the alternative is the application of radium or of the
rontgen rays, which, although requiring many exposures, results in cure
with the minimum of disfigurement. if the cancer already covers an
extensive area, or has invaded the cavity of the orbit or nose, radium
or x-rays yield the best results. the effect is soon shown by the
ingrowth of healthy epithelium from the surrounding skin, and at the
same time the discharge is lessened. good results are also reported from
the application of carbon dioxide snow, especially when this follows
upon a course of x-ray treatment.

#paget's disease# of the nipple is an epithelioma occurring in women
over forty years of age: a similar form of epithelioma is sometimes met
with at the umbilicus or on the genitals.

#melanotic cancer.#--under this head are included all new growths which
contain an excess of melanin pigment. many of these were formerly
described as melanotic sarcoma. they nearly always originate in a
pigmented mole which has been subjected to irritation. the primary
growth may remain so small that its presence is not even suspected, or
it may increase in size, ulcerate, and fungate. the amount of pigment
varies: when small in amount the growth is brown, when abundant it is a
deep black. the most remarkable feature is the rapidity with which the
disease becomes disseminated along the lymphatics, the first evidence of
which is an enlargement of the lymph glands. as the primary growth is
often situated on the sole of the foot or in the matrix of the nail of
the great toe, the femoral and inguinal glands become enlarged in
succession, forming tumours much larger than the primary growth.
sometimes the dissemination involves the lymph vessels of the limb,
forming a series of indurated pigmented cords and nodules (fig. 104).
lastly, the dissemination may be universal throughout the body, and this
usually occurs at a comparatively early stage. the secondary growths are
deeply pigmented, being usually of a coal-black colour, and melanin
pigment may be present in the urine. when recurrence takes place in or
near the scar left by the operation, the cancer nodules are not
necessarily pigmented.

[illustration: fig. 104.--diffuse melanotic cancer of lymphatics of skin
secondary to a growth in the sole of the foot.]

to extirpate the disease it is necessary to excise the tumour, with a
zone of healthy skin around it and a somewhat large zone of the
underlying subcutaneous tissue and deep fascia. hogarth pringle
recommends that a broad strip of subcutaneous fascia up to and including
the nearest anatomical group of glands should be removed with the tumour
in one continuous piece.

#secondary cancer of the skin.#--cancer may spread to the skin from a
subjacent growth by direct continuity or by way of the lymphatics. both
of these processes are so well illustrated in cases of mammary cancer
that they will be described in relation to that disease.

#sarcoma# of various types is met with in the skin. the fibroma, after
excision, may recur as a fibro-sarcoma. the alveolar sarcoma commences
as a hard lump and increases in size until the epidermis gives way and
an ulcer is formed.

[illustration: fig. 105.--melanotic cancer of forehead with metastases
in lymph vessels and glands.

(mr. d. p. d. wilkie's case.)]

a number of fresh tumours may spring up around the original growth.
sometimes the primary growth appears in the form of multiple nodules
which tend to become confluent. excision, unless performed early, is of
little avail, and in any case should be followed up by exposure to
radium.


affections of cicatrices

a cicatrix or scar consists of closely packed bundles of white fibres
covered by epidermis; the skin glands and hair follicles are usually
absent. the size, shape, and level of the cicatrix depend upon the
conditions which preceded healing.

a healthy scar, when recently formed, has a smooth, glossy surface of a
pinkish colour, which tends to become whiter as a result of obliteration
of the blood vessels concerned in its formation.

_weak scars._--a scar is said to be weak when it readily breaks down as
a result of irritation or pressure. the scars resulting from severe
burns and those over amputation stumps are especially liable to break
down from trivial causes. the treatment is to excise the weak portion of
the scar and bring the edges of the gap together.

_contracted scars_ frequently cause deformity either by displacing
parts, such as the eyelid or lip, or by fixing parts and preventing the
normal movements--for example, a scar on the flexor aspect of a joint
may prevent extension of the forearm (fig. 63). these are treated by
dividing the scar, correcting the deformity, and filling up the gap with
epithelial grafts, or with a flap of the whole thickness of the skin.
when deformity results from _depression of a scar_, as is not uncommon
after the healing of a sinus, the treatment is to excise the scar.
depressed scars may be raised by the injection of paraffin into the
subcutaneous tissue.

_painful scars._--pain in relation to a scar is usually due to nerve
fibres being compressed or stretched in the cicatricial tissue; and in
some cases to ascending neuritis. the treatment consists in excising the
scar or in stretching or excising a portion of the nerve affected.

_pigmented or discoloured scars._--the best-known examples are the blue
coloration which results from coal-dust or gunpowder, the brown scars
resulting from chronic ulcer with venous congestion of the leg, and the
variously coloured scars caused by tattooing. the only satisfactory
method of getting rid of the coloration is to excise the scar; the edges
are brought together by sutures, or the raw surface is covered with
skin-grafts according to the size of the gap.

_hypertrophied scars._--scars occasionally broaden out and become
prominent, and on exposed parts this may prove a source of
disappointment after operations such as those for goitre or tuberculous
glands in the neck. there is sometimes considerable improvement from
exposure to the x-rays.

_keloid._--this term is applied to an overgrowth of scar tissue which
extends beyond the area of the original wound, and the name is derived
from the fact that this extension occurs in the form of radiating
processes, suggesting the claws of a crab. it is essentially a fibroma
or new growth of fibrous tissue, which commences in relation to the
walls of the smaller blood vessels; the bundles of fibrous tissue are
for the most part parallel with the surface, and the epidermis is
tightly stretched over them. it is more frequent in the negro and in
those who are, or have been, the subjects of tuberculous disease.

[illustration: fig. 106.--recurrent keloid in scar left by operation for
tuberculous glands in a girl aet. 7.]

keloid may attack scars of any kind, such as those resulting from
leech-bites, acne pustules, boils or blisters; those resulting from
operation or accidental wounds; and the scars resulting from burns,
especially when situated over the sternum, appear to be specially
liable. the scar becomes more and more conspicuous, is elevated above
the surface, of a pinkish or brownish-pink pink colour, and sends out
irregular prolongations around its margins. the patient may complain of
itching and burning, and of great sensitiveness of the scar, even to
contact with the clothing.

there is a natural hesitation to excise keloid because of the fear of
its returning in the new scar. the application of radium is, so far as
we know, the only means of preventing such return. the irritation
associated with keloid may be relieved by the application of salicylic
collodion or of salicylic and creosote plaster.

_epithelioma_ is liable to attack scars in old people, especially those
which result from burns sustained early in childhood and have never
really healed. from the absence of lymphatics in scar tissue, the
disease does not spread to the glands until it has invaded the tissues
outside the scar; the prognosis is therefore better than in epithelioma
in general. it should be excised widely; in the lower extremity when
there is also extensive destruction of tissue from an antecedent chronic
ulcer or osteomyelitis, it may be better to amputate the limb.


affection of the nails

_injuries._--when a nail is contused or crushed, blood is extravasated
beneath it, and the nail is usually shed, a new one growing in its
place. a splinter driven underneath the nail causes great pain, and if
organisms are carried in along with it, may give rise to infective
complications. the free edge of the nail should be clipped away to allow
of the removal of the foreign body and the necessary disinfection.

_trophic changes._--the growth of the nails may be interfered with in
any disturbance of the general health. in nerve lesions, such as a
divided nerve-trunk, the nails are apt to suffer, becoming curved,
brittle, or furrowed, or they may be shed.

_onychia_ is the term applied to an infection of the soft parts around
the nail or of the matrix beneath it. the commonest form of onychia has
already been referred to with whitlow. there is a superficial variety
resulting from the extension of a purulent blister beneath the nail
lifting it up from its bed, the pus being visible through the nail. the
nail as well as the raised horny layer of the epidermis should be
removed. a deeper and more troublesome onychia results from infection at
the nail-fold; the infection spreads slowly beneath the fold until it
reaches the matrix, and a drop or two of pus forms beneath the nail,
usually in the region of the lunule. this affection entails a
disability of the finger which may last for weeks unless it is properly
treated. treatment by hyperaemia, using a suction bell, should first be
tried, and, failing improvement, the nail-fold and lunule should be
frozen, and a considerable portion removed with the knife; if only a
small portion of the nail is removed, the opening is blocked by
granulations springing from the matrix. a new nail is formed, but it is
liable to be misshapen.

_tuberculous onychia_ is met with in children and adolescents. it
appears as a livid or red swelling at the root of the nail and spreading
around its margins. the epidermis, which is thin and shiny, gives way,
and the nail is usually shed.

[illustration: fig. 107.--subungual exostosis growing from distal
phalanx of great toe, showing ulceration of skin and displacement of
nail.

_a._ surface view.   _b._ on section.]

_syphilitic_ affections of the nails assume various aspects. a primary
chancre at the edge of the nail may be mistaken for a whitlow,
especially if it is attended with much pain. other forms of onychia
occur during secondary syphilis simultaneously with the skin eruptions,
and may prove obstinate and lead to shedding of the nails. they also
occur in inherited syphilis. in addition to general treatment, an
ointment containing 5 per cent. of oleate of mercury should be applied
locally.

_ingrowing toe-nail._--this is more accurately described as an
overgrowth of the soft tissues along the edge of the nail. it is most
frequently met with in the great toe in young adults with flat-foot
whose feet perspire freely, who wear ill-fitting shoes, and who cut
their toe-nails carelessly or tear them with their fingers. where the
soft tissues are pressed against the edge of the nail, the skin gives
way and there is the formation of exuberant granulations and of
discharge which is sometimes foetid. the affection is a painful one and
may unfit the patient for work. in mild cases the condition may be
remedied by getting rid of contributing causes and by disinfecting the
skin and nail; the nail is cut evenly, and the groove between it and the
skin packed with an antiseptic dusting-powder, such as boracic acid. in
more severe cases it may be necessary to remove an ellipse of tissue
consisting of the edge of the nail, together with the subjacent matrix
and the redundant nail-fold.

_subungual exostosis_ is an osteoma growing from the terminal phalanx of
the great toe (fig. 107). it raises the nail and may be accompanied by
ulceration of the skin over the most prominent part of the growth. the
soft parts, including the nail, should be reflected towards the dorsum
in the form of a flap, the base of the exostosis divided with the
chisel, and the exostosis removed.

_malignant disease_ in relation to the nails is rare. squamous
epithelioma and melanotic cancer are the forms met with. treatment
consists in amputating the digit concerned, and in removing the
associated lymph glands.

    diseases of muscle and of tendons: _atrophy_; _"muscular
    rheumatism"_--_fibrositis_; _contracture_; _myositis_;
    _calcification and ossification_; _tumours_. diseases of tendon
    sheaths: _teno-synovitis_.


injuries

#contusion of muscle.#--contusion of muscle, which consists in bruising
of its fibres and blood vessels, may be due to violence acting from
without, as in a blow, a kick, or a fall; or from within, as by the
displacement of bone in a fracture or dislocation.

the symptoms are those common to all contusions, and the patient
complains of severe pain on attempting to use the muscle, and maintains
an attitude which relaxes it. if the sheath of the muscle also is torn,
there is subcutaneous ecchymosis, and the accumulation of blood may
result in the formation of a haematoma.

restoration of function is usually complete; but when the nerve
supplying the muscle is bruised at the same time, as may occur in the
deltoid, wasting and loss of function may be persistent. in exceptional
cases the process of repair may be attended with the formation of bone
in the substance of the muscle, and this may likewise impair its
function.

a contused muscle should be placed at rest and supported by cotton wool
and a bandage; after an interval, massage and appropriate exercises are
employed.

#sprain and partial rupture of muscle.#--this lesion consists in
overstretching and partial rupture of the fibres of a muscle or its
aponeurosis. it is of common occurrence in athletes and in those who
follow laborious occupations. it may follow upon a single or repeated
effort--especially in those who are out of training. familiar examples
of muscular sprain are the "labourer's" or "golfer's back," affecting
the latissimus dorsi or the sacrospinalis (erector spinae); the
"tennis-player's elbow," and the "sculler's sprain," affecting the
muscles and ligaments about the elbow; the "angler's elbow," affecting
the common origin of the extensors and supinators; the "sprinter's
sprain," affecting the flexors of the hip; and the "jumper's and
dancer's sprain," affecting the muscles of the calf. the patient
complains of pain, often sudden in onset, of tenderness on pressure, and
of inability to carry out the particular movement by which the sprain
was produced. the disability varies in different cases, and it may
incapacitate the patient from following his occupation or sport for
weeks or, if imperfectly treated, even for months.

the _treatment_ consists in resting the muscle from the particular
effort concerned in the production of the sprain, in gently exercising
it in other directions, in the use of massage, and the induction of
hyperaemia by means of heat. in neglected cases, that is, where the
muscle has not been exercised, the patient shrinks from using it and the
disablement threatens to be permanent; it is sometimes said that
adhesions have formed and that these interfere with the recovery of
function. the condition may be overcome by graduated movements or by a
sudden forcible movement under an anaesthetic. these cases afford a
fruitful field for the bone-setter.

#rupture of muscle or tendon.#--a muscle or a tendon may be ruptured in
its continuity or torn from its attachment to bone. the site of rupture
in individual muscles is remarkably constant, and is usually at the
junction of the muscular and tendinous portions. when rupture takes
place through the belly of a muscle, the ends retract, the amount of
retraction depending on the length of the muscle, and the extent of its
attachment to adjacent aponeurosis or bone. the biceps in the arm, and
the sartorius in the thigh, furnish examples of muscles in which the
separation between the ends may be considerable.

the gap in the muscle becomes filled with blood, and this in time is
replaced by connective tissue, which forms a bond of union between the
ends. when the space is considerable the connecting medium consists of
fibrous tissue, but when the ends are in contact it contains a number of
newly formed muscle fibres. in the process of repair, one or both ends
of the muscle or tendon may become fixed by adhesions to adjacent
structures, and if the distal portion of a muscle is deprived of its
nerve supply it may undergo degeneration and so have its function
impaired.

rupture of a muscle or tendon is usually the result of a sudden, and
often involuntary, movement. as examples may be cited the rupture of
the quadriceps extensor in attempting to regain the balance when falling
backwards; of the gastrocnemius, plantaris, or tendo-calcaneus in
jumping or dancing; of the adductors of the thigh in gripping a horse
when it swerves--"rider's sprain"; of the abdominal muscles in vomiting,
and of the biceps in sudden movements of the arm. sometimes the effort
is one that would scarcely be thought likely to rupture a muscle, as in
the case recorded by pagenstecher, where a professional athlete, while
sitting at table, ruptured his biceps in a sudden effort to catch a
falling glass. it would appear that the rupture is brought about not so
much by the contraction of the muscle concerned, as by the contraction
of the antagonistic muscles taking place before that of the muscle which
undergoes rupture is completed. the violent muscular contractions of
epilepsy, tetanus, or delirium rarely cause rupture.

the _clinical features_ are usually characteristic. the patient
experiences a sudden pain, with the sensation of being struck with a
whip, and of something giving way; sometimes a distant snap is heard.
the limb becomes powerless. at the seat of rupture there is tenderness
and swelling, and there may be ecchymosis. as the swelling subsides, a
gap may be felt between the retracted ends, and this becomes wider when
the muscle is thrown into contraction. if untreated, a hard, fibrous
cord remains at the seat of rupture.

_treatment._--the ends are approximated by placing the limb in an
attitude which relaxes the muscle, and the position is maintained by
bandages, splints, or special apparatus. when it is impossible thus to
approximate the ends satisfactorily, the muscle or tendon is exposed by
incision, and the ends brought into accurate contact by catgut sutures.
this operation of primary suture yields the most satisfactory results,
and is most successful when it is done within five or six days of the
accident. secondary suture after an interval of months is rendered
difficult by the retraction of the ends and by their adhesion to
adjacent structures.

_rupture of the biceps of the arm_ may involve the long or the short
head, or the belly of the muscle. most interest attaches to rupture of
the long tendon of origin. there is pain and tenderness in front of the
upper end of the humerus, the patient is unable to abduct or to elevate
the arm, and he may be unable to flex the elbow when the forearm is
supinated. the long axis of the muscle, instead of being parallel with
the humerus, inclines downwards and outwards. when the patient is asked
to contract the muscle, its belly is seen to be drawn towards the
elbow.

the _adductor longus_ may be ruptured, or torn from the pubes, by a
violent effort to adduct the limb. a swelling forms in the upper and
medial part of the thigh, which becomes smaller and harder when the
muscle is thrown into contraction.

the _quadriceps femoris_ is usually ruptured close to its insertion into
the patella, in the attempt to avoid falling backwards. the injury is
sometimes bilateral. the injured limb is rendered useless for
progression, as it suddenly gives way whenever the knee is flexed.
treatment is conducted on the same lines as in transverse fracture of
the patella; in the majority of cases the continuity of the quadriceps
should be re-established by suture within five or six days of the
accident.

the _tendo calcaneus_ (achillis) is comparatively easily ruptured, and
the symptoms are sometimes so slight that the nature of the injury may
be overlooked. the limb should be put up with the knee flexed and the
toes pointed. this may be effected by attaching one end of an elastic
band to the heel of a slipper, and securing the other to the lower third
of the thigh. if this is not sufficient to bring the ends into
apposition they should be approximated by an open operation.

the _plantaris_ is not infrequently ruptured from trivial causes, such
as a sudden movement in boxing, tennis, or hockey. a sharp stinging pain
like the stroke of a whip is felt in the calf; there is marked
tenderness at the seat of rupture, and the patient is unable to raise
the heel without pain. the injury is of little importance, and if the
patient does not raise the heel from the ground in walking, it is
recovered from in a couple of weeks or so, without it being necessary to
lay him up.

#hernia of muscle.#--this is a rare condition, in which, owing to the
fascia covering a muscle becoming stretched or torn, the muscular
substance is protruded through the rent. it has been observed chiefly in
the adductor longus. an oval swelling forms in the upper part of the
thigh, is soft and prominent when the muscle is relaxed, less prominent
when it is passively extended, and disappears when the muscle is thrown
into contraction. it is liable to be mistaken, according to its
situation, for a tumour, a cyst, a pouched vein, or a femoral or
obturator hernia. treatment is only called for when it is causing
inconvenience, the muscle being exposed by a suitable incision, the
herniated portion excised, and the rent in the sheath closed by sutures.

#dislocation of tendons.#--tendons which run in grooves may be displaced
as a result of rupture of the confining sheath. this injury is met with
chiefly in the tendons at the ankle and in the long tendon of the
biceps.

dislocation of the _peronei tendons_ may occur, for example, from a
violent twist of the foot. there is severe pain and considerable
swelling on the lateral aspect of the ankle; the peroneus longus by
itself, or together with the brevis, can be felt on the lateral aspect
or in front of the lateral malleolus; the patient is unable to move the
foot. by a little manipulation the tendons are replaced in their
grooves, and are retained there by a series of strips of plaster. at the
end of three weeks massage and exercises are employed.

in other cases there is no history of injury, but whenever the foot is
everted the tendon of the peroneus longus is liable to be jerked
forwards out of its groove, sometimes with an audible snap. the patient
suffers pain and is disabled until the tendon is replaced. reduction is
easy, but as the displacement tends to recur, an operation is required
to fix the tendon in its place. an incision is made over the tendon; if
the sheath is slack or torn, it is tightened up or closed with catgut
sutures; or an artificial sheath is made by raising up a quadrilateral
flap of periosteum from the lateral aspect of the fibula, and stitching
it over the tendon.

similarly the _tibialis posterior_ may be displaced over the medial
malleolus as a result of inversion of the foot.

the _long tendon of the biceps_ may be dislocated laterally--or more
frequently medially--as a result of violent or repeated rotation
movements of the arm, such as are performed in wringing clothes. the
patient is aware of the displacement taking place, and is unable to
extend the forearm until the displaced tendon has been reduced by
abducting the arm. in recurrent cases the patient may be able to
dislocate the tendon at will, but the disability is so inconsiderable
that there is rarely any occasion for interference.

#wounds of muscles and tendons.#--when a muscle is cut across in a
wound, its ends should be brought together with sutures. if the ends are
allowed to retract, and especially if the wound suppurates, they become
united by scar tissue and fixed to bone or other adjacent structure. in
a limb this interferes with the functions of the muscle; in the
abdominal wall the scar tissue may stretch, and so favour the
development of a ventral hernia.

tendons may be cut across accidentally, especially in those wounds so
commonly met with above the wrist as a result, for example, of the hand
being thrust through a pane of glass. it is essential that the ends
should be sutured to each other, and as the proximal end is retracted
the original wound may require to be enlarged in an upward direction.
when primary suture has been omitted, or has failed in consequence of
suppuration, the separated ends of the tendon become adherent to
adjacent structures, and the function of the associated muscle is
impaired or lost. under these conditions the operation of secondary
suture is indicated.

a free incision is necessary to discover and isolate the ends of the
tendon; if the interval is too wide to admit of their being approximated
by sutures, means must be taken to lengthen the tendon, or one from some
other part may be inserted in the gap. a new sheath may be provided for
the tendon by resecting a portion of the great saphenous vein.

_injuries of the tendons of the fingers_ are comparatively common. one
of the best known is the partial or complete rupture of the aponeurosis
of the extensor tendon close to its insertion into the terminal
phalanx--_drop-_ or _mallet-finger_. this may result from comparatively
slight violence, such as striking the tip of the extended finger against
an object, or the violence may be more severe, as in attempting to catch
a cricket ball or in falling. the terminal phalanx is flexed towards the
palm and the patient is unable to extend it. the treatment consists in
putting up the finger with the middle joint strongly flexed. in
neglected cases, a perfect functional result can only be obtained by
operation; under a local anaesthetic, the ruptured tendon is exposed and
is sutured to the base of the phalanx, which may be drilled for the
passage of the sutures.

_subcutaneous rupture_ of one or other _of the digital tendons_ in the
hand or at the wrist can be remedied only by operation. when some time
has elapsed since the accident, the proximal end may be so retracted
that it cannot be brought down into contact with the distal end, in
which case a slip may be taken from an adjacent tendon; in the case of
one of the extensors of the thumb, the extensor carpi radialis longus
may be detached from its insertion and stitched to the distal end of the
tendon of the thumb.

subcutaneous _rupture of the tendon of the extensor pollicis longus_ at
the wrist takes place just after its emergence from beneath the annular
ligament; the actual rupture may occur painlessly, more frequently a
sharp pain is felt over the back of the wrist. the prominence of the
tendon, which normally forms the ulnar border of the snuff-box,
disappears. this lesion is chiefly met with in drummer-boys and is the
cause of drummer's palsy. the only chance of restoring function is in
uniting the ruptured tendon by open operation.

[illustration: fig. 108.--avulsion of tendon with terminal phalanx of
thumb.

(surgical museum, university of edinburgh.)]

_avulsion of tendons._--this is a rare injury, in which the tendons of a
finger or toe are torn from their attachments along with a portion of
the digit concerned. in the hand, it is usually brought about by the
fingers being caught in the reins of a runaway horse, or being seized in
a horse's teeth, or in machinery. it is usually the terminal phalanx
that is separated, and with it the tendon of the deep flexor, which
ruptures at its junction with the belly of the muscle (fig. 108). the
treatment consists in disinfecting the wound, closing the tendon-sheath,
and trimming the mutilated finger so as to provide a useful stump.


diseases of muscles and tendons

_congenital absence_ of muscles is sometimes met with, usually in
association with other deformities. the pectoralis major, for example,
may be absent on one or on both sides, without, however, causing any
disability, as other muscles enlarge and take on its functions.

_atrophy of muscle._--simple atrophy, in which the muscle elements are
merely diminished in size without undergoing any structural alteration,
is commonly met with as a result of disuse, as when a patient is
confined to bed for a long period.

in cases of joint disease, the muscles acting on the joint become
atrophied more rapidly than is accounted for by disuse alone, and this
is attributed to an interference with the trophic innervation of the
muscles reflected from centres in the spinal medulla. it is more marked
in the extensor than in the flexor groups of muscles. those affected
become soft and flaccid, exhibit tremors on attempted movement, and
their excitability to the faradic current is diminished.

_neuropathic atrophy_ is associated with lesions of the nervous system.
it is most pronounced in lesions of the motor nerve-trunks, probably
because vaso-motor and trophic fibres are involved as well as those that
are purely motor in function. it is attended with definite structural
alterations, the muscle elements first undergoing fatty degeneration,
and then being absorbed, and replaced to a large extent by ordinary
connective tissue and fat. at a certain stage the muscles exhibit the
reaction of degeneration. in the common form of paralysis resulting from
poliomyelitis, many fibres undergo fatty degeneration and are replaced
by fat, while at the same time there is a regeneration of muscle fibres.

#fibrositis# or "#muscular rheumatism#."--this clinical term is applied
to a group of affections of which lumbago is the best-known example. the
group includes lumbago, stiff-neck, and pleurodynia--conditions which
have this in common, that sudden and severe pain is excited by movement
of the affected part. the lesion consists in inflammatory hyperplasia of
the connective tissue; the new tissue differs from normal fibrous tissue
in its tendency to contract, in being swollen, painful and tender on
pressure, and in the fact that it can be massaged away (stockman). it
would appear to involve mainly the fibrous tissue of muscles, although
it may extend from this to aponeuroses, ligaments, periosteum, and the
sheaths of nerves. the term _fibrositis_ was applied to it by gowers in
1904.

in _lumbago_--_lumbo-sacral fibrositis_--the pain is usually located
over the sacrum, the sacro-iliac joint, or the aponeurosis of the lumbar
muscles on one or both sides. the amount of tenderness varies, and so
long as the patient is still he is free from pain. the slightest
attempt to alter his position, however, is attended by pain, which may
be so severe as to render him helpless for the moment. the pain is most
marked on rising from the stooping or sitting posture, and may extend
down the back of the hip, especially if, as is commonly the case,
lumbago and gluteal fibrosis coexist. once a patient has suffered from
lumbago, it is liable to recur, and an attack may be determined by
errors of diet, changes of weather, exposure to cold or unwonted
exertion. it is met with chiefly in male adults, and is most apt to
occur in those who are gouty or are the subjects of oxaluric dyspepsia.

_gluteal fibrositis_ usually follows exposure to wet, and affects the
gluteal muscles, particularly the medius, and their aponeurotic
coverings. when the condition has lasted for some time, indurated
strands or nodules can be detected on palpating the relaxed muscles. the
patient complains of persistent aching and stiffness over the buttock,
and sometimes extending down the lateral aspect of the thigh. the pain
is aggravated by such movements as bring the affected muscles into
action. it is not referred to the line of the sciatic nerve, nor is
there tenderness on pressing over the nerve, or sensations of tingling
or numbness in the leg or foot.

if untreated, the morbid process may implicate the sheath of the sciatic
nerve and cause genuine sciatic neuralgia (llewellyn and jones). a
similar condition may implicate the fascia lata of the thigh, or the
calf muscles and their aponeuroses--_crural fibrositis_.

in _painful stiff-neck_, or "rheumatic torticollis," the pain is located
in one side of the neck, and is excited by some inadvertent movement.
the head is held stiffly on one side as in wry-neck, the patient
contracting the sterno-mastoid. there may be tenderness over the
vertebral spines or in the lines of the cervical nerves, and the
sterno-mastoid may undergo atrophy. this affection is more often met
with in children.

in _pleurodynia_--_intercostal fibrositis_--the pain is in the line of
the intercostal nerves, and is excited by movement of the chest, as in
coughing, or by any bodily exertion. there is often marked tenderness.

a similar affection is met with in the _shoulder and arm_--_brachial
fibrositis_--especially on waking from sleep. there is acute pain on
attempting to abduct the arm, and there may be localised tenderness in
the region of the axillary nerve.

_treatment._--the general treatment is concerned with the diet,
attention to the stomach, bowels, and kidneys and with the correction
of any gouty tendencies that may be present. remedies such as
salicylates are given for the relief of pain, and for this purpose drugs
of the aspirin type are to be preferred, and these may be followed by
large doses of iodide of potassium. great benefit is derived from
massage, and from the induction of hyperaemia by means of heat. cupping
or needling, or, in exceptional cases, hypodermic injections of
antipyrin or morphin, may be called for. to prevent relapses of lumbago,
the patient must take systematic exercises of all kinds, especially such
as bring out the movements of the vertebral column and hip-joints.

[illustration: fig. 109.--volkmann's ischaemic contracture. when the
wrist is flexed to a right angle it is possible to extend the fingers.

(photographs lent by mr. lawford knaggs)]

#contracture of muscles.#--permanent shortening of muscles results from
the prolonged approximation of their points of attachment, or from
structural changes in their substance produced by injury or by disease.
it is a frequent accompaniment and sometimes a cause of deformities, in
the treatment of which lengthening of the shortened muscles or their
tendons may be an essential step.

#myositis.#--_ischaemic myositis._--volkmann was the first to describe a
form of myositis followed by contracture, resulting from interference
with the arterial blood supply. it is most frequently observed in the
flexor muscles of the forearm in children and young persons under
treatment for fractures in the region of the elbow, the splints and
bandages causing compression of the blood vessels. there is considerable
effusion of blood, the skin is tense, and the muscles, vessels, and
nerves are compressed; this is further increased if the elbow is flexed
and splints and tight bandages are applied. the muscles acquire a
board-like hardness and no longer contract under the will, and passive
motion is painful and restricted. slight contracture of the fingers is
usually the first sign of the malady; in time the muscles undergo
further contraction, and this brings about a claw-like deformity of the
hand. the affected muscles usually show the reaction of degeneration. in
severe cases the median and ulnar nerves are also the seat of
cicatricial changes (ischaemic neuritis).

by means of splints, the interphalangeal, metacarpo-phalangeal, and
wrist joints should be gradually extended until the deformity is
over-corrected (r. jones). murphy advises resection of the radius and
ulna sufficient to admit of dorsiflexion of the joints and lengthening
of the flexor tendons.

various forms of _pyogenic_ infection are met with in muscle, most
frequently in relation to pyaemia and to typhoid fever. these may result
in overgrowth of the connective-tissue framework of the muscle and
degeneration of its fibres, or in suppuration and the formation of one
or more abscesses in the muscle substance. repair may be associated with
contracture.

a _gonorrhoeal_ form of myositis is sometimes met with; it is painful,
but rarely goes on to suppuration.

in the early secondary period of _syphilis_, the muscles may be the seat
of dull, aching, nocturnal pains, especially in the neck and back.
_syphilitic contracture_ is a condition which has been observed chiefly
in the later secondary period; the biceps of the arm and the hamstrings
in the thigh are the muscles more commonly affected. the striking
feature is a gradually increasing difficulty of extending the limb at
the elbow or knee, and progressive flexion of the joint. the affected
muscle is larger and firmer than normal, and its electric excitability
is diminished. in tertiary syphilis, individual muscles may become the
seat of interstitial myositis or of gummata, and these affections
readily yield to anti-syphilitic remedies.

_tuberculous disease_ in muscle, while usually due to extension from
adjacent tissues, is sometimes the result of a primary infection through
the blood-stream. tuberculous nodules are found disseminated throughout
the muscle; the surrounding tissues are indurated, and central caseation
may take place and lead to abscess formation and sinuses. we have
observed this form of tuberculous disease in the gastrocnemius and in
the psoas--in the latter muscle apart from tuberculous disease in the
vertebrae.

#tendinitis.#--german authors describe an inflammation of tendon as
distinguished from inflammation of its sheath, and give it the name
tendinitis. it is met with most frequently in the tendo-calcaneus in
gouty and rheumatic subjects who have overstrained the tendon,
especially during cold and damp weather. there is localised pain which
is aggravated by walking, and the tendon is sensitive and swollen from a
little above its insertion to its junction with the muscle. gouty
nodules may form in its substance. constitutional measures, massage, and
douching should be employed, and the tendon should be protected from
strain.

#calcification and ossification in muscles, tendons, and
fasciae.#--_myositis ossificans._--ossifications in muscles, tendons,
fasciae, and ligaments, in those who are the subjects of arthritis
deformans, are seldom recognised clinically, but are frequently met with
in dissecting-rooms and museums. similar localised ossifications are met
with in charcot's disease of joints, and in fractures which have
repaired with exuberant callus. the new bone may be in the form of
spicules, plates, or irregular masses, which, when connected with a
bone, are called _false exostoses_ (fig. 110).

[illustration: fig. 110.--ossification in tendon of ilio-psoas muscle.]

_traumatic ossification in relation to muscle._--various forms of
ossification are met with in muscle as the result of a single or of
repeated injury. ossification in the crureus or vastus lateralis muscle
has been frequently observed as a result of a kick from a horse. within
a week or two a swelling appears at the site of injury, and becomes
progressively harder until its consistence is that of bone. if the mass
of new bone moves with the affected muscle, it causes little
inconvenience. if, as is commonly the case, it is fixed to the femur,
the action of the muscle is impaired, and the patient complains of pain
and difficulty in flexing the knee. a skiagram shows the extent of the
mass and its relationship to the femur. the treatment consists in
excising the bony mass.

difficulty may arise in differentiating such a mass of bone from
sarcoma; the ossification in muscle is uniformly hard, while the sarcoma
varies in consistence at different parts, and the x-ray picture shows a
clear outline of the bone in the vicinity of the ossification in
muscle, whereas in sarcoma the involvement of the bone is shown by
indentations and irregularity in its contour.

a similar ossification has been observed in relation to the insertion of
the brachialis muscle as a sequel of dislocation of the elbow. after
reduction of the dislocation, the range of movement gradually diminishes
and a hard swelling appears in front of the lower end of the humerus.
the lump continues to increase in size and in three to four weeks the
disability becomes complete. a radiogram shows a shadow in the muscle,
attached at one part as a rule to the coronoid process. during the next
three or four months, the lump in front of the elbow remains stationary
in size; a gradual decrease then ensues, but the swelling persists, as a
rule, for several years.

[illustration: fig. 111.--calcification and ossification in biceps and
triceps.

(from a radiogram lent by dr. c. a. adair dighton.)]

ossification in the adductor longus was first described by billroth
under the name of "rider's bone." it follows bruising and partial
rupture of the muscle, and has been observed chiefly in cavalry
soldiers. if it causes inconvenience the bone may be removed by
operation.

ossification in the deltoid and pectoral muscles has been observed in
foot-soldiers in the german army, and has received the name of
"drill-bone"; it is due to bruising of the muscle by the recoil of the
rifle.

_progressive ossifying myositis._--this is a rare and interesting
disease, in which the muscles, tendons, and fasciae throughout the body
become the seat of ossification. it affects almost exclusively the male
sex, and usually begins in childhood or youth, sometimes after an
injury, sometimes without apparent cause. the muscles of the back,
especially the trapezius and latissimus, are the first to be affected,
and the initial complaint is limitation of movement.

[illustration: fig. 112.--ossification in muscles of trunk in a case of
generalised ossifying myositis.

(photograph lent by dr. rustomjee.)]

the affected muscles show swellings which are rounded or oval, firm and
elastic, sharply defined, without tenderness and without discoloration
of the overlying skin. skiagrams show that a considerable deposit of
lime salts may precede the formation of bone, as is seen in fig. 111. in
course of time the vertebral column becomes rigid, the head is bent
forward, the hips are flexed, and abduction and other movements of the
arms are limited. the disease progresses by fits and starts, until all
the striped muscles of the body are replaced by bone, and all movements,
even those of the jaws, are abolished. the subjects of this disease
usually succumb to pulmonary tuberculosis.

there is no means of arresting the disease, and surgical treatment is
restricted to the removal or division of any mass of bone that
interferes with an important movement.

a remarkable feature of this disease is the frequent presence of a
deformity of the great toe, which usually takes the form of hallux
valgus, the great toe coming to lie beneath the second one; the
shortening is usually ascribed to absence of the first phalanx, but it
has been shown to depend also on a synostosis and imperfect development
of the phalanges. a similar deformity of the thumb is sometimes met
with.

microscopical examination of the muscles shows that, prior to the
deposition of lime salts and the formation of bone, there occurs a
proliferation of the intra-muscular connective tissue and a gradual
replacement and absorption of the muscle fibres. the bone is spongy in
character, and its development takes place along similar lines to those
observed in ossification from the periosteum.

#tumours of muscle.#--with the exception of congenital varieties, such
as the rhabdomyoma, tumours of muscle grow from the connective-tissue
framework and not from the muscle fibres. innocent tumours, such as the
fibroma, lipoma, angioma, and neuro-fibroma, are rare. malignant tumours
may be primary in the muscle, or may result from extension from adjacent
growths--for example, implication of the pectoral muscle in cancer of
the breast--or they may be derived from tumours situated elsewhere. the
diagnosis of an intra-muscular tumour is made by observing that the
swelling is situated beneath the deep fascia, that it becomes firm and
fixed when the muscle contracts, and that, when the muscle is relaxed,
it becomes softer, and can be moved in the transverse axis of the
muscle, but not in its long axis.

clinical interest attaches to that form of slowly growing
fibro-sarcoma--_the recurrent fibroid of paget_--which is most
frequently met with in the muscles of the abdominal wall. a rarer
variety is the ossifying chondro-sarcoma, which undergoes ossification
to such an extent as to be visible in skiagrams.

in primary sarcoma the treatment consists in removing the muscle. in the
limbs, the function of the muscle that is removed may be retained by
transplanting an adjacent muscle in its place.

_hydatid cysts_ of muscle resemble those developing in other tissues.


diseases of tendon sheaths

tendon sheaths have the same structure and function as the synovial
membranes of joints, and are liable to the same diseases. apart from the
tendon sheaths displayed in anatomical dissections, there is a loose
peritendinous and perimuscular cellular tissue which is subject to the
same pathological conditions as the tendon sheaths proper.

#teno-synovitis.#--the toxic or infective agent is conveyed to the
tendon sheaths through the blood-stream, as in the gouty, gonorrhoeal,
and tuberculous varieties, or is introduced directly through a wound, as
in the common pyogenic form of teno-synovitis.

_teno-synovitis crepitans._--in the simple or traumatic form of
teno-synovitis, although the most prominent etiological factor is a
strain or over-use of the tendon, there would appear to be some other,
probably a toxic, factor in its production, otherwise the affection
would be much more common than it is: only a small proportion of those
who strain or over-use their tendons become the subjects of
teno-synovitis. the opposed surfaces of the tendon and its sheath are
covered with fibrinous lymph, so that there is friction when they move
on one another.

the _clinical features_ are pain on movement, tenderness on pressure
over the affected tendon, and a sensation of crepitation or friction
when the tendon is moved in its sheath. the crepitation may be soft like
the friction of snow, or may resemble the creaking of new
leather--"saddle-back creaking." there may be swelling in the long axis
of the tendon, and redness and oedema of the skin. if there is an
effusion of fluid into the sheath, the swelling is more marked and
crepitation is absent. there is little tendency to the formation of
adhesions.

in the upper extremity, the sheath of the long tendon of the biceps may
be affected, but the condition is most common in the tendons about the
wrist, particularly in the extensors of the thumb, and it is most
frequently met with in those who follow occupations which involve
prolonged use or excessive straining of these tendons--for example,
washerwomen or riveters. it also occurs as a result of excessive
piano-playing, fencing, or rowing.

at the ankle it affects the peronei, the extensor digitorum longus, or
the tibialis anterior. it is most often met with in relation to the
tendo-calcaneus--_achillo-dynia_--and results from the pressure of
ill-fitting boots or from the excessive use and strain of the tendon in
cycling, walking, or dancing. there is pain in raising the heel from the
ground, and creaking can be felt on palpation.

the _treatment_ consists in putting the affected tendon at rest, and
with this object a splint may be helpful; the usual remedies for
inflammation are indicated: bier's hyperaemia, lead and opium
fomentations, and ichthyol and glycerine. the affection readily subsides
under treatment, but is liable to relapse on a repetition of the
exciting cause.

_gouty teno-synovitis._--a deposit of urate of soda beneath the
endothelial covering of tendons or of that lining their sheaths is
commonly met with in gouty subjects. the accumulation of urates may
result in the formation of visible nodular swellings, varying in size
from a pea to a cherry, attached to the tendon and moving with it. they
may be merely unsightly, or they may interfere with the use of the
tendon. recurrent attacks of inflammation are prone to occur. we have
removed such gouty masses with satisfactory results.

_suppurative teno-synovitis._--this form usually follows upon infected
wounds of the fingers--especially of the thumb or little finger--and is
a frequent sequel to whitlow; it may also follow amputation of a finger.
once the infection has gained access to the sheath, it tends to spread,
and may reach the palm or even the forearm, being then associated with
cellulitis. in moderately acute cases the tendon and its sheath become
covered with granulations, which subsequently lead to the formation of
adhesions; while in more acute cases the tendon sloughs. the pus may
burst into the cellular tissue outside the sheath, and the suppuration
is liable to spread to neighbouring sheaths or to adjacent bones or
joints--for example, those of the wrist.

the _treatment_ consists in inducing hyperaemia and making small
incisions for the escape of pus. the site of incision is determined by
the point of greatest tenderness on pressure. after the inflammation has
subsided, active and passive movements are employed to prevent the
formation of adhesions between the tendon and its sheath. if the tendon
sloughs, the dead portion should be cut away, as its separation is
extremely slow and is attended with prolonged suppuration.

_gonorrhoeal teno-synovitis._--this is met with especially in the tendon
sheaths about the wrist and ankle. it may occur in a mild form, with
pain, impairment of movement, and oedema, and sometimes an elongated,
fluctuating swelling, the result of serous effusion into the sheath.
this condition may alternate with a gonorrhoeal affection of one of the
larger joints. it may subside under rest and soothing applications, but
is liable to relapse. in the more severe variety the skin is red, and
the swelling partakes of the characters of a phlegmon with threatening
suppuration; it may result in crippling from adhesions. even if pus
forms in the sheath, the tendon rarely sloughs. the treatment consists
in inducing hyperaemia by bier's method; and a vaccine may be employed
with satisfactory results.

#tuberculous disease of tendon sheaths.#--this is a comparatively common
affection, and is analogous to tuberculous disease of the synovial
membrane of joints. it may originate in the sheath, or may spread to it
from an adjacent bone.

the commonest form--hydrops--is that in which the synovial sheath is
distended with a viscous fluid, and the fibrinous material on the free
surface becomes detached and is moulded into melon-seed bodies by the
movement of the tendon. the sheath itself is thickened by the growth of
tuberculous granulation tissue. the bodies are smooth and of a
dull-white colour, and vary greatly in size and shape. there may be an
overgrowth of the fatty fringes of the synovial sheath, a condition
described as "arborescent lipoma."

the _clinical features_ vary with the tendon sheath affected. in the
common flexor sheath of the hand an hour-glass-shaped swelling is
formed, bulging above and below the transverse carpal (anterior annular)
ligament--formerly known as _compound palmar ganglion_. there is little
or no pain, but the fingers tend to be stiff and weak, and to become
flexed. on palpation, it is usually possible to displace the contents of
the sheath from one compartment to the other, and this may yield
fluctuation, and, what is more characteristic, a peculiar soft crepitant
sensation from the movement of the melon-seed bodies. in the sheath of
the peronei or other tendons about the ankle, the swelling is
sausage-shaped, and is constricted opposite the annular ligament.

the onset and progress of the affection are most insidious, and the
condition may remain stationary for long periods. it is aggravated by
use or strain of the tendons involved. in exceptional cases the skin is
thinned and gives way, resulting in the formation of a sinus.

_treatment._--in the common flexor sheath of the palm, an attempt may be
made to cure the condition by removing the contents through a small
incision and filling the cavity with iodoform glycerine, followed by the
use of bier's bandage. if this fails, the distended sheath is laid open,
the contents removed, the wall scraped, and the wound closed.

a less common form of tuberculous disease is that in which the sheath
becomes the seat of _a diffuse tuberculous thickening_, not unlike the
white swelling met with in joints, and with a similar tendency to
caseation. a painless swelling of an elastic character forms in relation
to the tendon sheath. it is hour-glass-shaped in the common flexor
sheath of the palm, elongated or sausage-shaped in the extensors of the
wrist and in the tendons at the ankle. the tuberculous granulation
tissue is liable to break down and lead to the formation of a cold
abscess and sinuses, and in our experience is often associated with
disease in an adjacent bone or joint. in the peronei tendons, for
example, it may result from disease of the fibula or of the ankle-joint.

when conservative measures fail, excision of the affected sheath should
be performed; the whole of the diseased area being exposed by free
incision of the overlying soft parts, the sheath is carefully isolated
from the surrounding tissues and is cut across above and below. any
tuberculous tissue on the tendon itself is removed with a sharp spoon.
associated bone or joint lesions are dealt with at the same time. in the
after-treatment the functions of the tendons must be preserved by
voluntary and passive movements.

#syphilitic affections of tendon sheaths.#--these closely resemble the
syphilitic affections of the synovial membrane of joints. during the
secondary period the lesion usually consists in effusion into the
sheath; gummata are met with during the tertiary period.

arborescent lipoma has been found in the sheaths of tendons about the
wrist and ankle, sometimes in a multiple and symmetrical form,
unattended by symptoms and disappearing under anti-syphilitic treatment.

#tumours of tendon sheaths.#--innocent tumours, such as _lipoma_,
_fibroma_, and _myxoma_, are rare. special mention should be made of the
_myeloma_ which is met with at the wrist or ankle as an elongated
swelling of slow development, or over the phalanx of a finger as a small
rounded swelling. the tumour tissue, when exposed by dissection, is of a
chocolate or chamois-yellow colour, and consists almost entirely of
giant cells. the treatment consists in dissecting the tumour tissue off
the tendons, and this is usually successful in bringing about a
permanent cure.

all varieties of _sarcoma_ are met with, but their origin from tendon
sheaths is not associated with special features.




chapter xix

the bursae


anatomy--normal and adventitious bursae--injuries: bursal
    haematoma--diseases: infective bursitis; traumatic or trade
    bursitis; bursal hydrops; solid bursal tumour; gonorrhoeal and
    suppurative forms of bursitis; tuberculous and syphilitic
    disease--tumours--_diseases of individual bursae in the upper and
    lower extremities_.

a bursa is a closed sac lined by endothelium and containing synovia.
some are normally present--for instance, that between the skin and the
patella, and that between the aponeurosis of the gluteus maximus and the
great trochanter. _adventitious bursae_ are developed as a result of
abnormal pressure--for example, over the tarsal bones in cases of
club-foot.

#injuries of bursae.#--as a result of contusion, especially in bleeders,
haemorrhage may occur into the cavity of a bursa and give rise to a
_bursal haematoma_. such a haematoma may mask a fracture of the bone
beneath--for example, fracture of the olecranon.

#diseases of bursae.#--the lining membrane of bursae resembles that of
joints and tendon sheaths, and is liable to the same forms of disease.

#infective bursitis# frequently follows abrasions, scratches, and wounds
of the skin over the prepatellar or olecranon bursa, and in neglected
cases the infection transgresses the wall of the bursa and gives rise to
a spreading cellulitis.

#traumatic or trade bursitis.#--this term may be conveniently applied to
those affections of bursae which result from repeated slight traumatism
incident to particular occupations. the most familiar examples of these
are the enlargement of the prepatellar bursa met with in housemaids--the
"housemaid's knee" (fig. 113); the enlargement of the olecranon
bursa--"miner's elbow"; and of the ischial bursa--"weaver's" or
"tailor's bottom" (fig. 116). these affections are characterised by an
effusion of fluid into the sac of the bursa with thickening of its
lining membrane. while friction and pressure are the most evident
factors in their production, it is probable that there is also some
toxic agent concerned, otherwise these affections would be much more
common than they are. of the countless housemaids in whom the
prepatellar bursa is subjected to friction and pressure, only a small
proportion become the subjects of housemaid's knee.

_clinical features._--as these are best illustrated in the different
varieties of prepatellar bursitis, it is convenient to take this as the
type. in a number of cases the inflammation is acute and the patient is
unable to use the limb; the part is hot, swollen, and tender, and
fluctuation can be detected in the bursa. in the majority the condition
is chronic, and the chief feature is the gradual accumulation of fluid
constituting the _bursal hydrops_ or _hygroma_. when the affection has
lasted some time, or has frequently relapsed, the wall of the bursa
becomes thickened by fibrous tissue, which may be deposited irregularly,
so that septa, bands, or fringes are formed, not unlike those met with
in arthritis deformans. these fringes may be detached and form loose
bodies like those met with in joints; less frequently there are
fibrinous bodies of the melon-seed type, sometimes moulded into circular
discs like wafers. the presence of irregular thickenings of the wall, or
of loose bodies, may be recognised on palpation, especially in
superficial bursae, if the sac is not tensely filled with fluid. the
thickening of the wall may take place in a uniform and concentric
fashion, resulting in the formation of a fibrous tumour--_the solid
bursal tumour_--a small cavity remaining in the centre which serves to
distinguish it from a new growth or neoplasm.

[illustration: fig. 113.--hydrops of prepatellar bursa in a housemaid.]

the _treatment_ varies according to the variety and stage of the
affection. in recent cases the symptoms subside under rest and the
application of fomentations. hydrops may be got rid of by blistering,
by tapping, or by incision and drainage. when the wall is thickened, the
most satisfactory treatment is to excise the bursa; the overlying skin
being reflected in the shape of a horse-shoe flap or being removed along
with the bursa.

#other diseases of bursae# are associated with _gonorrhoeal infection_,
and with _rheumatism_, especially that following scarlet fever, and are
apt to be persistent or to relapse after apparent cure. in the _gouty_
form, urate of soda is deposited in the wall of the bursa, and may
result in the formation of chalky tumours, sometimes of considerable
size (fig. 114).

[illustration: fig. 114.--section through bursa over external malleolus,
showing deposit of urate of soda. (cf. fig. 117.)]

_tuberculous disease_ of bursae closely resembles that of tendon sheaths.
it may occur as an independent affection, or may be associated with
disease in an adjacent bone or joint. it is met with chiefly in the
prepatellar and subdeltoid bursae, or in one of the bursae over the great
trochanter. the clinical features are those of an indolent hydrops, with
or without melon-seed bodies, or of uniform thickening of the wall of
the bursa; the tuberculous granulation tissue may break down into a cold
abscess, and give rise to sinuses. the best treatment is to excise the
affected bursa, or, when this is impracticable, to lay it freely open,
remove the tuberculous tissue with the sharp spoon or knife, and treat
the cavity by the open method.

_syphilitic disease_ is rarely recognised except in the form of bursal
and peri-bursal gummata in front of the knee-joint.

_new growths_ include the fibroma, the myxoma, the myeloma or
giant-celled tumour, and various forms of sarcoma.

#diseases of individual bursae.#--the _olecranon bursa_ is frequently
the seat of pyogenic infection and of traumatic or trade bursitis, the
latter being known as "miner's" or "student's elbow."

[illustration: fig. 115.--tuberculous disease of sub-deltoid bursa.

(from a photograph lent by sir george t. beatson.)]

the _sub-deltoid_ or _sub-acromial bursa_, which usually presents a
single cavity and does not normally communicate with the shoulder-joint,
is indispensable in abduction and rotation of the humerus. when the arm
is abducted, the fixed lower part or floor of the bursa is carried under
the acromion, and the upper part or roof is rolled up in the same
direction, hence tenderness over the inflamed bursa may disappear when
the arm is abducted (dawbarn's sign). it is liable to traumatic
affections from a fall on the shoulder, pressure, or over-use of the
limb. pain, located commonly at the insertion of the deltoid, is a
constant symptom and is especially annoying at night, the patient being
unable to get into a comfortable position. tenderness may be elicited
over the anatomical limits of the bursa, and is usually most marked over
the great tuberosity, just external to the inter-tubercular (bicipital)
groove. when adhesions are present, abduction beyond 10 degrees is
impossible. demonstrable effusion is not uncommon, but is disguised by
the overlying tissues. if left to himself, the patient tends to maintain
the limb in the "sling position," and resists movements in the direction
of abduction and rotation. in the treatment of this affection the arm
should be maintained at a right angle to the body, the arm being rotated
medially (codman). when pain does not prevent it, movements of the arm
and massage are persevered with. in neglected cases, when adhesions have
formed and the shoulder is fixed, it may be necessary to break down the
adhesions under an anaesthetic.

the bursa is also liable to infective conditions, such as acute
rheumatism, gonorrhoea, suppuration, or tubercle. in tuberculous disease
a large fluctuating swelling may form and acquire the characters of a
cold abscess (fig. 115).

the bursa underneath the tendon of the _subscapularis_ muscle when
inflamed causes alteration in the attitude of the shoulder and
impairment of its movements.

an adventitious bursa forms over the _acromion_ process in porters and
others who carry weights on the shoulder, and may be the seat of
traumatic bursitis.

the bursa under the _tendon of insertion of the biceps_, when the seat
of disease, is attended with pain and swelling about a finger's breadth
below the bend of the elbow; there is pain and difficulty in effecting
the combined movement of flexion and supination, slight limitation of
extension, and restriction of pronation.

in the lower extremity, a large number of normal and adventitious bursae
are met with and may be the seat of bursitis. that over the _tuberosity
of the ischium_, when enlarged as a trade disease, is known as
"weaver's" or "tailor's bottom." it may form a fluctuating swelling of
great size, projecting on the buttock and extending down the thigh, and
causing great inconvenience in sitting (fig. 116). it sometimes contains
a number of loose bodies.

there are two bursae over the _great trochanter_, one superficial to, the
other beneath the aponeurosis of the gluteus maximus; the latter is not
infrequently infected by tuberculous disease that has spread from the
trochanter.

the bursa _between the psoas muscle and the capsule of the hip-joint_
may be the seat of tuberculous disease, and give rise to clinical
features not unlike those of disease of the hip-joint. the limb is
flexed, abducted and rotated out; there is a swelling in the upper part
of scarpa's triangle, but the movements are not restricted in directions
which do not entail putting the ilio-psoas muscle on the stretch.

cartilaginous and partly ossified loose bodies may accumulate in the
ilio-psoas bursa and distend it, both in a downward direction towards
the hip-joint, with which it communicates, and upwards, projecting
towards the abdomen.

the bursa beneath the quadriceps extensor--_subcrural bursa_--usually
communicates with the knee-joint and shares in its diseases. when shut
off from the joint it may suffer independently, and when distended with
fluid forms a horse-shoe swelling above the patella.

in front of the patella and its ligament is the _prepatellar bursa_,
which may have one, two, or three compartments, usually communicating
with one another. it is the seat of the affection known as "housemaid's
knee," which is very common and is sometimes bilateral, and, less
frequently, of tuberculous disease which usually originates in the
patella.

[illustration: fig. 116.--great enlargement of the ischial bursa.

(mr. scot-skirving's case.)]

the bursa _between the ligamentum patellae and the tibia_ is rarely the
seat of disease. when it is, there is pain and tenderness referred to
the ligament, the patient is unable to extend the limb completely, the
tuberosity of the tibia is apparently enlarged, and there is a
fluctuating swelling on either side of the ligament, most marked in the
extended position of the limb.

of the numerous bursae in the popliteal space, that _between the
semi-membranosus and the medial head of the gastrocnemius_ is most
frequently the seat of disease, which is usually of the nature of a
simple hydrops, forming a fluctuating egg-or sausage-shaped swelling at
the medial side of the popliteal space. it is flaccid in the flexed, and
tense in the extended position. as a rule it causes little
inconvenience, and may be left alone. otherwise it should be dissected
out, and if, as is frequently the case, there is a communication with
the knee-joint, this should be closed with sutures.

[illustration: fig. 117.--gouty disease of bursae in a tailor. the bursal
tumours were almost entirely composed of urate of soda. (cf. fig. 114.)]

an adventitious bursa may form over the _lateral malleolus_, especially
in tailors, giving rise to the condition known as "tailor's ankle"
(fig. 117).

the bursa _between the tendo-calcaneus (achillis) and the upper part of
the calcaneus_ may become inflamed--especially as a result of
post-scarlatinal rheumatism or gonorrhoea. the affection is known as
achillo-bursitis. there is severe pain in the region of the insertion of
the tendo-calcaneus, the movements at the ankle-joint are restricted,
and the patient may be unable to walk. there is a tender swelling on
either side of the tendon. when, in spite of palliative treatment, the
affection persists or relapses, it is best to excise the bursa. the
tendo-calcaneus is detached from the calcaneus, the bursa dissected out,
and the tendon replaced. if there is a bony projection from the
calcaneus, it should be shaved off with the chisel.

the bursa that is sometimes met with on the under aspect of the
calcaneus--_the subcalcanean bursa_--when inflamed, gives rise to pain
and tenderness in the sole of the foot. this affection may be associated
with a spinous projection from the bone, which is capable of being
recognised in a skiagram. the soft parts of the heel are turned forwards
as a flap, the bursa is dissected out, and the projection of bone, if
present, is removed.

the enlargement of adventitious bursae over the head of the first
metatarsal in hallux valgus; over the tarsus, metatarsus, and digits in
the different forms of club-foot; over the angular projection in pott's
disease of the spine; over the end of the bone in amputation stumps, and
over hard tumours such as chondroma and osteoma, are described
elsewhere.

#surgical anatomy.#--during the period of growth, a long bone such as
the tibia consists of a shaft or _diaphysis_, and two extremities or
_epiphyses_. so long as growth continues there intervenes between the
shaft and each of the epiphyses a disc of actively growing
cartilage--_the epiphysial cartilage_; and at the junction of this
cartilage with the shaft is a zone of young, vascular, spongy bone known
as the _metaphysis_ or _epiphysial junction_. the shaft is a cylinder of
compact bone enclosing the medullary canal, which is filled with yellow
marrow. the extremities, which include the ossifying junctions, consist
of spongy bone, the spaces of which are filled with red marrow. the
articular aspect of the epiphysis is invested with a thick layer of
hyaline cartilage, known as the _articular cartilage_, which would
appear to be mainly nourished from the synovia.

the external investment--the _periosteum_--is thick and vascular during
the period of growth, but becomes thin and less vascular when the
skeleton has attained maturity. except where muscles are attached it is
easily separated from the bone; at the extremities it is intimately
connected with the epiphysial cartilage and with the epiphysis, and at
the margin of the latter it becomes continuous with the capsule of the
adjacent joint. it consists of two layers, an outer fibrous and an inner
cellular layer; the cells, which are called osteoblasts, are continuous
with those lining the haversian canals and the medullary cavity.

the arrangement of the _blood vessels_ determines to some extent the
incidence of disease in bone. the nutrient artery, after entering the
medullary canal through a special foramen in the cortex, bifurcates, and
one main division runs towards each of the extremities, and terminates
at the ossifying junction in a series of capillary loops projected
against the epiphysial cartilage. this arrangement favours the lodgment
of any organisms that may be circulating in the blood, and partly
accounts for the frequency with which diseases of bacterial origin
develop in the region of the ossifying junction. the diaphysis is also
nourished by numerous blood vessels from the periosteum, which penetrate
the cortex through the haversian canals and anastomose with those
derived from the nutrient artery. the epiphyses are nourished by a
separate system of blood vessels, derived from the arteries which supply
the adjacent joint. the veins of the marrow are of large calibre and are
devoid of valves.

the _nerves_ enter the marrow along with the arteries, and, being
derived from the sympathetic system, are probably chiefly concerned with
the innervation of the blood vessels, but they are also capable of
transmitting sensory impulses, as pain is a prominent feature of many
bone affections.

it has long been believed that _the function of the periosteum_ is to
form new bone, but this view has been questioned by sir william macewen,
who maintains that its chief function is to limit the formation of new
bone. his experimental observations appear to show that new bone is
exclusively formed by the cellular elements or osteoblasts: these are
found on the surface of the bone, lining the haversian canals and in the
marrow. we believe that it will avoid confusion in the study of the
diseases of bone if the osteoblasts on the surface of the bone are still
regarded as forming the deeper layer of the periosteum.

the formation of new bone by the osteoblasts may be _defective_ as a
result of physiological conditions, such as old age and disease of a
part, and defective formation is often associated with atrophy, or more
strictly speaking, absorption, of the existing bone, as is well seen in
the edentulous jaw and in the neck of the femur of a person advanced in
years. defective formation associated with atrophy is also illustrated
in the bones of the lower limbs of persons who are unable to stand or
walk, and in the distal portion of a bone which is the seat of an
ununited fracture. the same combination is seen in an exaggerated degree
in the bones of limbs that are paralysed; in the case of adults, atrophy
of bone predominates; in children and adolescents, defective formation
is the more prominent feature, and the affected bones are attenuated,
smooth on the surface, and abnormally light.

on the other hand, the formation of new bone may be _exaggerated_, the
osteoblasts being excited to abnormal activity by stimuli of different
kinds: for example, the secretion of certain glandular organs, such as
the pituitary and thyreoid; the diluted toxins of certain
micro-organisms, such as the staphylococcus aureus and the spirochaete of
syphilis; a condition of hyperaemia, such as that produced artificially
by the application of a bier's bandage or that which accompanies a
chronic leg-ulcer.

the new bone is laid down on the surface, in the haversian canals, or
in the cancellous spaces and medullary canal, or in all three
situations. the new bone on the surface sometimes takes the form of a
diffuse _encrustation_ of porous or spongy bone as in secondary
syphilis, sometimes as a uniform increase in the girth of the
bone--_hyperostosis_, sometimes as a localised heaping up of bone or
_node_, and sometimes in the form of spicules, spoken of as
_osteophytes_. when the new bone is laid down in the haversian canals,
cancellous spaces and medulla, the bone becomes denser and heavier, and
is said to be _sclerosed_; in extreme instances this may result in
obliteration of the medullary canal. hyperostosis and sclerosis are
frequently met with in combination, a condition that is well illustrated
in the femur and tibia in tertiary syphilis; if the subject of this
condition is confined to bed for several months before his death, the
sclerosis may be undone, and rarefaction may even proceed beyond the
normal, the bone becoming lighter and richer in fat, although retaining
its abnormal girth.

the _function of the epiphysial cartilage_ is to provide for the growth
of the shaft in length. while all epiphysial cartilages contribute to
this result, certain of them functionate more actively and for a longer
period than others. those at the knee, for example, contribute more to
the length of limb than do those at the hip or ankle, and they are also
the last to unite. in the upper limb the more active epiphyses are at
the shoulder and wrist, and these also are the last to unite.

the activity of the epiphysial cartilage may be modified as a result of
disease. in rickets, for example, the formation of new bone may take
place unequally, and may go on more rapidly in one half of the disc than
in the other, with the result that the axis of the shaft comes to
deviate from the normal, giving rise to knock-knee or bow-knee. in
bacterial diseases originating in the marrow, if the epiphysial junction
is directly involved in the destructive process, its bone-forming
functions may be retarded or abolished, and the subsequent growth of the
bone be seriously interfered with. on the other hand, if it is not
directly involved but is merely influenced by the proximity of an
infective focus, its bone-forming functions may be stimulated by the
diluted toxins and the growth of the bone in length exaggerated. in
paralysed limbs the growth from the epiphyses is usually little short of
the normal. the result of interference with growth is more injurious in
the lower than in the upper limb, because, from the functional point of
view, it is essential that the lower extremities should be approximately
of equal length. in the forearm or leg, where there are two parallel
bones, if the growth of one is arrested the continued growth of the
other results in a deviation of the hand or foot to one side.

in certain diseases, such as rickets and inherited syphilis, and in
developmental anomalies such as achondroplasia, _dwarfing_ of the
skeleton results from defective growth of bone at the ossifying
junctions. conversely, excessive growth of bone at the ossifying
junctions results in abnormal height of the skeleton or _giantism_ as a
result, for example, of increased activity of the pituitary in
adolescents, and in eunuchs who have been castrated in childhood or
adolescence; in the latter, union of the epiphyses at the ends of the
long bones is delayed beyond the usual period at which the skeleton
attains maturity.

#regeneration of bone.#--when bone has been lost or destroyed as a
result of injury or disease, it is capable of being reproduced, the
extent to which regeneration takes place varying under different
conditions. the chief part in the regeneration of bone is played by the
osteoblasts in the adjacent marrow and in the deeper layer of the
periosteum. the shaft of a long bone may be reproduced after having been
destroyed by disease or removed by operation. the flat bones of the
skull and the bones of the face, which are primarily developed in
membrane, have little capacity of regeneration; hence, when bone has
been lost or removed in these situations, there results a permanent
defect.

wounds or defects in articular cartilage are repaired by fibrous or
osseous tissue derived from the subjacent cancellous spaces.

_transplantation of bone--bone-grafting._--clinical experience is
conclusive that a portion of bone which has been completely detached
from its surroundings--for example, a trephine circle, or a flap of bone
detached with the saw, or the loose fragments in a compound
fracture--may become, if replaced in position, firmly and permanently
incorporated with the surrounding bone. embedded foreign bodies, on the
other hand, such as ivory pegs or decalcified bone, exhibit, on removal
after a sufficient interval, evidence of having been eroded, in the
shape of worm-eaten depressions and perforations, and do not become
united or fused to the surrounding bone. it follows from this that the
implanting of living bone is to be preferred to the implanting of dead
bone or of foreign material. we believe that transplanted living bone
when placed under favourable conditions survives and becomes
incorporated with the bone with which it is in contact, and does not
merely act as a scaffolding. we believe also that the retention of the
periosteum on the graft is not essential, but, by favouring the
establishment of vascular connections, it contributes to the survival of
the graft and the success of the transplantation. macewen maintains that
bone grafts "take" better if broken up into small fragments; we regard
this as unnecessary. bone grafts yield better functional results when
they are immovably fixed to the adjacent bone by suture, pegs, or
plates. as in all grafting procedures, asepsis is essential.

transplanted bone retains its vitality when embedded in the soft parts,
but is gradually absorbed and replaced by fibrous tissue.


diseases of bone

the morbid processes met with in bone originate in the same way and lead
to the same results as do similar processes in other tissues. the
structural peculiarities of bone, however, and the important changes
which take place in the skeleton during the period of growth, modify
certain of the clinical and pathological features.

_definition of terms._--any diseased process that affects the periosteum
is spoken of as _periostitis_; the term _osteomyelitis_ is employed when
it is located in the marrow. the term _epiphysitis_ has been applied to
an inflammatory process in two distinct situations--namely, the
ossifying nucleus in the epiphysis, and the ossifying junction or
metaphysis between the epiphysial cartilage and the diaphysis. we shall
restrict the term to inflammation in the first of these situations.
inflammation at the ossifying junction is included under the term
osteomyelitis.

the term _rarefying ostitis_ is applied to any process that is attended
with excessive absorption of the framework of a bone, whereby it becomes
more porous or spongy than it was before, a condition known as
_osteoporosis_.

the term _caries_ is employed to indicate any diseased process
associated with crumbling away of the trabecular framework of a bone. it
may be considered as the equivalent of ulceration or molecular
destruction in the soft parts. the carious process is preceded by the
formation of granulation tissue in the marrow or periosteum, which eats
away and replaces the bone in contact with it. the subsequent
degeneration and death of the granulation tissue under the necrotic
influence of bacterial toxins results in disintegration and crumbling
away of the trabecular framework of the portion of bone affected.
clinically, carious bone yields a soft grating sensation under the
pressure of the probe. the macerated bone presents a rough, eroded
surface.

the term _dry caries_ (_caries sicca_) is applied to that variety which
is unattended with suppuration.

_necrosis_ is the term applied to the death of a tangible portion of
bone, and the dead portion when separated is called a _sequestrum_. the
term _exfoliation_ is sometimes employed to indicate the separation or
throwing off of a superficial sequestrum. the edges and deep surface of
the sequestrum present a serrated or worm-eaten appearance due to the
process of erosion by which the dead bone has been separated from the
living.


bacterial diseases

the most important diseases in this group are the pyogenic, the
tuberculous, and the syphilitic.

pyogenic diseases of bone.--these diseases result from
infection with pyogenic organisms, and two varieties or types are
recognised according to whether the organisms concerned reach their seat
of action by way of the blood-stream, or through an infection of the
soft parts in contact with the bone.


infections through the blood-stream

#diseases caused by the staphylococcus aureus.#--as the majority of
pyogenic diseases are due to infection with the staphylococcus aureus,
these will be described first.

#acute osteomyelitis# is a suppurative process beginning in the marrow
and tending to spread to the periosteum. the disease is common in
children, but is rare after the skeleton has attained maturity. boys are
affected more often than girls, in the proportion of three to one,
probably because they are more liable to exposure, to injury, and to
violent exertion.

_etiology._--staphylococci gain access to the blood-stream in various
ways, it may be through the skin or through a mucous surface.

such conditions as, for example, a blow, some extra exertion such as a
long walk, or exposure to cold, as in wading, may act as localising
factors.

the long bones are chiefly affected, and the commonest sites are: either
end of the tibia and the lower end of the femur; the other bones of the
skeleton are affected in rare instances.

_pathology._--the disease commences and is most intense in the marrow of
the ossifying junction at one end of the diaphysis; it may commence at
both ends simultaneously--_bipolar osteomyelitis_; or, commencing at one
end, may spread to the other.

the changes observed are those of intense engorgement of the marrow,
going on to greenish-yellow purulent infiltration. where the process is
most advanced--that is, at the ossifying junction--there are evidences
of absorption of the framework of the bone; the marrow spaces and
haversian canals undergo enlargement and become filled with
greenish-yellow pus. this rarefaction of the spongy bone is the earliest
change seen with the x-rays.

the process may remain localised to the ossifying junction, but usually
spreads along the medullary canal for a varying distance, and also
extends to the periosteum by way of the enlarged haversian canals. the
pus accumulates under the periosteum and lifts it up from the bone. the
extent of spread in the medullary canal and beneath the periosteum is in
close correspondence. the periosteum of the diaphysis is easily
separated--hence the facility with which the pus spreads along the
shaft; but in the region of the ossifying junction it is raised with
difficulty because of its intimate connection with the epiphysial
cartilage. less frequently there is more than one collection of pus
under the periosteum, each being derived from a focus of suppuration in
the subjacent marrow. the pus perforates the periosteum, and makes its
way to the surface by the easiest anatomical route, and discharges
externally, forming one or more sinuses through which fresh infection
may take place. the infection may spread to the adjacent joint, either
directly through the epiphysis and articular cartilage, or along the
deep layer of the periosteum and its continuation--the capsular
ligament. when the epiphysis is intra-articular, as, for example, in the
head of the femur, the pus when it reaches the surface of the bone
necessarily erupts directly into the joint.

while the occurrence of purely periosteal suppuration is regarded as
possible, we are of opinion that the embolic form of staphylococcal
osteomyelitis always originates in the marrow.

the portion of the diaphysis which has sustained the action of the
concentrated toxins has its vitality further impaired as a result of the
stripping of the periosteum and thrombosis of the blood vessels of the
marrow, so that _necrosis_ of bone is one of the most striking results
of the disease, and as this takes place rapidly, that is, in a day or
two, the term _acute necrosis_, formerly applied to the disease, was
amply justified.

when there is marked rarefaction of the bone at the ossifying junction,
the epiphysis is liable to be separated--_epiphysiolysis_. the
separation usually takes place through the young bone of the ossifying
junction, and the surfaces of the diaphysis and epiphysis are opposed to
each other by irregular eroded surfaces bathed in pus. the separated
epiphysis may be kept in place by the periosteum, but when this has been
detached by the formation of pus beneath it, the epiphysis is liable to
be displaced by muscular action or by some movement of the limb, or it
is the diaphysis that is displaced, for example, the lower end of the
diaphysis of the femur may be projected into the popliteal space.

the epiphysial cartilage usually continues its bone-forming functions,
but when it has been seriously damaged or displaced, the further growth
of the bone in length may be interfered with. sometimes the separated
and displaced epiphysis dies and constitutes a sequestrum.

the adjacent joint may become filled at an early stage with a serous
effusion, which may be sterile. when the cocci gain access to the joint,
the lesion assumes the characters of a purulent arthritis, which, from
its frequency during the earlier years of life, has been called _the
acute arthritis of infants_.

separation of an epiphysis nearly always results in infection and
destruction of the adjacent joint.

osteomyelitis is rare in the bones of the carpus and tarsus, and the
associated joints are usually infected from the outset. in flat bones,
such as the skull, the scapula, or the ilium, suppuration usually occurs
on both aspects of the bone as well as in the marrow.

_clinical features._--the constitutional symptoms, which are due to the
associated toxaemia, vary considerably in different cases. in mild cases
they may be so slight as to escape recognition. in exceptionally severe
cases the patient may succumb before there are obvious signs of the
localisation of the staphylococci in the bone marrow. in average cases
the temperature rises rapidly with a rigor and runs an irregular course
with morning remissions, there is marked general illness accompanied by
headache, vomiting, and sometimes delirium.

the local manifestations are pain and tenderness in relation to one of
the long bones; the pain may be so severe as to prevent sleep and to
cause the child to cry out. tenderness on pressure over the bone is the
most valuable diagnostic sign. at a later stage there is an ill-defined
swelling in the region of the ossifying junction, with oedema of the
overlying skin and dilatation of the superficial veins.

the swelling appears earlier and is more definite in superficial bones
such as the tibia, than in those more deeply placed such as the upper
end of the femur. it may be less evident to the eye than to the fingers,
and is best appreciated by gently stroking the bone from the middle of
its shaft towards the end. the maximum thickening and tenderness usually
correspond to the junction of the diaphysis with the epiphysis, and the
swelling tails off gradually along the shaft. as time goes on there is
redness of the skin, especially over a superficial bone, such as the
tibia, the swelling becomes softer, and gives evidence of fluctuation.
this stage may be reached at the end of twenty-four hours, or not for
some days.

suppuration spreads towards the surface, until, some days later, the
skin sloughs and pus escapes, after which the fever usually remits and
the pain and other symptoms are relieved. the pus may contain blood and
droplets of fat derived from the marrow, and in some cases minute
particles of bone are present also. the presence of fat and bony
particles in the pus confirms the medullary origin of the suppuration.

if an incision is made, the periosteum is found to be raised from the
bone; the extent of the bare bone will be found to correspond fairly
accurately with the extent of the lesion in the marrow.

_local complications._--the adjacent joint may exhibit symptoms which
vary from those of a simple effusion to those of a purulent _arthritis_.
the joint symptoms may count for little in the clinical picture, or, as
in the case of the hip, may so predominate as to overshadow those of the
bone lesion from which they originated.

_separation and displacement of the epiphysis_ usually reveals itself by
an alteration in the attitude of the limb; it is nearly always
associated with suppuration in the adjacent joint.

when _pathological fracture_ of the shaft occurs, as it may do, from
some muscular effort or strain, it is attended with the usual signs of
fracture.

_dislocation_ of the adjacent joint has been chiefly observed at the
hip; it may result from effusion into the joint and stretching of the
ligaments, or may be the sequel of a purulent arthritis; the signs of
dislocation are not so obvious as might be expected, but it is attended
with an alteration in the attitude of the limb, and the displacement of
the head of the bone is readily shown in a skiagram.

_general complications._--in some cases a _multiplicity of lesions_ in
the bones and joints imparts to the disease the features of pyaemia. the
occurrence of endocarditis, as indicated by alterations in the heart
sounds and the development of murmurs, may cause widespread infective
embolism, and metastatic suppurations in the kidneys, heart-wall, and
lungs, as well as in other bones and joints than those primarily
affected. the secondary suppurations are liable to be overlooked unless
sought for, as they are rarely attended with much pain.

in these multiple forms of osteomyelitis the toxaemic symptoms
predominate; the patient is dull and listless, or he may be restless and
talkative, or actually delirious. the tongue is dry and coated, the lips
and teeth are covered with sordes, the motions are loose and offensive,
and may be passed involuntarily. the temperature is remittent and
irregular, the pulse small and rapid, and the urine may contain blood
and albumen. sometimes the skin shows erythematous and purpuric rashes,
and the patient may cry out as in meningitis. the post-mortem
appearances are those of pyaemia.

_differential diagnosis._--acute osteomyelitis is to be diagnosed from
infections of the soft parts, such as erysipelas and cellulitis, and, in
the case of the tibia, from erythema nodosum. tenderness localised to
the ossifying junction is the most valuable diagnostic sign of
osteomyelitis.

when there is early and pronounced general intoxication, there is likely
to be confusion with other acute febrile illnesses, such as scarlet
fever. in all febrile conditions in children and adolescents, the
ossifying junctions of the long bones should be examined for areas of
pain and tenderness.

osteomyelitis has many features in common with acute articular
rheumatism, and some authorities believe them to be different forms of
the same disease (kocher). in acute rheumatism, however, the joint
symptoms predominate, there is an absence of suppuration, and the pains
and temperature yield to salicylates.

the _prognosis_ varies with the type of the disease, with its
location--the vertebrae, skull, pelvis, and lower jaw being specially
unfavourable--with the multiplicity of the lesions, and with the
development of endocarditis and internal metastases.

_treatment._--this is carried out on the same lines as in other pyogenic
infections.

in the earliest stages of the disease, the induction of hyperaemia is
indicated, and should be employed until the diagnosis is definitely
established, and in the meantime preparations for operation should be
made. an incision is made down to and through the periosteum, and
whether pus is found or not, the bone should be opened in the vicinity
of the ossifying junction by means of a drill, gouge, or trephine. if
pus is found, the opening in the bone is extended along the shaft as far
as the periosteum has been separated, and the infected marrow is removed
with the spoon. the cavity is then lightly packed with rubber dam, or,
as recommended by bier, the skin edges are brought together by sutures
which are loosely tied to afford sufficient space between them for the
exit of discharge, and the hyperaemic treatment is continued.

when there is widespread suppuration in the marrow, and the shaft is
extensively bared of periosteum and appears likely to die, it may be
resected straight away or after an interval of a day or two. early
resection of the shaft is also indicated if the opening of the medullary
canal is not followed by relief of symptoms. in the leg and forearm, the
unaffected bone maintains the length and contour of the limb; in the
case of the femur and humerus, extension with weight and pulley along
with some form of moulded gutter splint is employed with a similar
object.

amputation of the limb is reserved for grave cases, in which life is
endangered by toxaemia, which is attributed to the primary lesion. it may
be called for later if the limb is likely to be useless, as, for
example, when the whole shaft of the bone is dead without the formation
of a new case, when the epiphyses are separated and displaced, and the
joints are disorganised.

flat bones, such as the skull or ilium, must be trephined and the pus
cleared out from both aspects of the bone. in the vertebrae, operative
interference is usually restricted to opening and draining the
associated abscess.

#nature's effort at repair.#--_in cases which are left to nature_, and
in which necrosis of bone has occurred, those portions of the periosteum
and marrow which have retained their vitality resume their osteogenetic
functions, often to an exaggerated degree. where the periosteum has been
lifted up by an accumulation of pus, or is in contact with bone that is
dead, it proceeds to form new bone with great activity, so that the dead
shaft becomes surrounded by a sheath or case of new bone, known as the
_involucrum_ (fig. 118). where the periosteum has been perforated by pus
making its way to the surface, there are defects or holes in the
involucrum, called _cloacae_. as these correspond more or less in
position to the sinuses in the skin, in passing a probe down one of the
sinuses it usually passes through a cloaca and strikes the dead bone
lying in the interior. if the periosteum has been extensively
destroyed, new bone may only be formed in patches, or not at all. the
dead bone is separated from the living by the agency of granulation
tissue with its usual complements of phagocytes and osteoclasts, so that
the sequestrum presents along its margins and on its deep surface a
pitted, grooved, and worm-eaten appearance, except on the periosteal
aspect, which is unaltered. ultimately the dead bone becomes loose and
lies in a cavity a little larger than itself; the wall of the cavity is
formed by the new case, lined with granulation tissue. the separation of
the sequestrum takes place more rapidly in the spongy bone of the
ossifying junction than in the compact bone of the shaft.

when foci of suppuration have been scattered up and down the medullary
cavity, and the bone has died in patches, several sequestra may be
included by the new case; each portion of dead bone is slowly separated,
and comes to lie in a cavity lined by granulations.

even at a distance from the actual necrosis there is formation of new
bone by the marrow; the medullary canal is often obliterated, and the
bone becomes heavier and denser--sclerosis; and the new bone which is
deposited on the original shaft results in an increase in the girth of
the bone--hyperostosis.

[illustration: fig. 118.--shaft of femur after acute osteomyelitis. the
shaft has undergone extensive necrosis, and a shell of new bone has been
formed by the periosteum.]

_pathological fracture_ of the shaft may occur at the site of necrosis,
when the new case is incapable of resisting the strain put upon it, and
is most frequently met with in the shaft of the femur. short of
fracture, there may be bending or curving of the new case, and this
results in deformity and shortening of the limb (fig. 119).

the _extrusion of a sequestrum_ may occur, provided there is a cloaca
large enough to allow of its escape, but the surgeon has usually to
interfere by performing the operation of sequestrectomy. displacement or
partial extrusion of the dead bone may cause complications, as when a
sequestrum derived from the trigone of the femur perforates the
popliteal artery or the cavity of the knee-joint, or a sequestrum of the
pelvis perforates the wall of the urinary bladder.

the extent to which bone which has been lost is reproduced varies in
different parts of the skeleton: while the long bones, the scapula, the
mandible, and other bones which are developed in cartilage are almost
completely re-formed, bones which are entirely developed in membrane,
such as the flat bones of the skull and the maxilla, are not reproduced.

[illustration: fig. 119.--femur and tibia showing results of acute
osteomyelitis affecting trigone of femur; sequestrum partly surrounded
by new case; backward displacement of lower epiphysis and implication of
knee-joint.]

it may be instructive to describe _the x-ray appearances of a long bone
that has passed through an attack of acute osteomyelitis_ severe enough
to have caused necrosis of part of the diaphysis. the shadow of the dead
bone is seen in the position of the original shaft which it represents;
it is of the same shape and density as the original shaft, while its
margins present an irregular contour from the erosion concerned in its
separation. the sequestrum is separated from the living bone by a clear
zone which corresponds to the layer of granulations lining the cavity in
which it lies. this clear zone separating the shadow of the dead bone
from that of the living bone by which it is surrounded is conclusive
evidence of a sequestrum. the medullary canal in the vicinity of the
sequestrum being obliterated, is represented by a shadow of varying
density, continuous with that of the surrounding bone. the shadow of the
new case or involucrum with its wavy contour is also in evidence, with
its openings or cloacae, and is mainly responsible for the increase in
the diameter of the bone.

the skiagram may also show separation and displacement of the adjacent
epiphysis and destruction of the articular surfaces or dislocation of
the joint.

_sequelae of acute suppurative osteomyelitis._--the commonest sequel is
the presence of a sequestrum with one or more discharging sinuses; owing
to the abundant formation of scar tissue these sinuses have rigid edges
which are usually depressed and adherent to the bone.

_the recognition and removal of sequestra._--so long as there is dead
bone there will be suppuration from the granulations lining the cavity
in which it lies, and a discharge of pus from the sinuses, so that the
mere persistence of discharge after an attack of osteomyelitis, is
presumptive evidence of the occurrence of necrosis. where there are one
or more sinuses, the passage of a probe which strikes bare bone affords
corroboration of the view that the bone has perished. when the dead bone
has been separated from the living, the x-rays yield the most exact
information.

the traditional practice is to wait until the dead bone is entirely
separated before undertaking an operation for its removal, from fear, on
the one hand, of leaving portions behind which may keep up the
discharge, and, on the other, of removing more bone than is necessary.
this practice need not be adhered to, as by operating at an earlier
stage healing is greatly hastened. if it is decided to wait for
separation of the dead bone, drainage should be improved, and the
infective element combated by the induction of hyperaemia.

_the operation_ for the removal of the dead bone (_sequestrectomy_)
consists in opening up the periosteum and the new case sufficiently to
allow of the removal of all the dead bone, including the most minute
sequestra. the limb having been rendered bloodless, existing sinuses are
enlarged, but if these are inconveniently situated--for example, in the
centre of the popliteal space in necrosis of the femoral trigone--it is
better to make a fresh wound down to the bone on that aspect of the
limb which affords best access, and which entails the least injury of
the soft parts. the periosteum, which is thick and easily separable, is
raised from the new case with an elevator, and with the chisel or gouge
enough of the new bone is taken away to allow of the removal of the
sequestrum. care must be taken not to leave behind any fragment of dead
bone, as this will interfere with healing, and may determine a relapse
of suppuration.

the dead bone having been removed, the lining granulations are scraped
away with a spoon, and the cavity is disinfected.

there are different ways of dealing with a _bone cavity_. it may be
packed with gauze (impregnated with "bipp" or with iodoform), which is
changed at intervals until healing takes place from the bottom; it may
be filled with a flap of bone and periosteum raised from the vicinity,
or with bone grafts; or the wall of bone on one side of the cavity may
be chiselled through at its base, so that it can be brought into contact
with the opposite wall. the method of filling bone cavities devised by
mosetig-moorhof, consists in disinfecting and drying the cavity by a
current of hot air, and filling it with a mixture of powdered iodoform
(60 parts) and oil of sesame and spermaceti (each 40 parts), which is
fluid at a temperature of 112 o f.; the soft parts are then brought
together without drainage. as the cavity fills up with new bone the
iodoform is gradually absorbed. iodoform gives a dark shadow with the
x-rays, so that the process of its absorption can be followed in
skiagrams taken at intervals.

these procedures may be carried out at the same time as the sequestrum
is removed, or after an interval. in all of them, asepsis is essential
for success.

the _deformities_ resulting from osteomyelitis are more marked the
earlier in life the disease occurs. even under favourable conditions,
and with the continuous effort at reconstruction of the bone by nature's
method, the return to normal is often far from perfect, and there
usually remains a variable amount of hyperostosis and sclerosis and
sometimes curving of the bone. under less favourable conditions, the
late results of osteomyelitis may be more serious. _shortening_ is not
uncommon from interference with growth at the ossifying junction.
_exaggerated growth_ in the length of a bone is rare, and has been
observed chiefly in the bones of the leg. where there are two parallel
bones--as in the leg, for example--the growth of the diseased bone may
be impaired, and the other continuing its normal growth becomes
disproportionately long; less frequently the growth of the diseased
bone is exaggerated, and it becomes the longer of the two. in either
case, the longer bone becomes curved. an _obliquity_ of the bone may
result when one half of the epiphysial cartilage is destroyed and the
other half continues to form bone, giving rise to such deformities as
knock-knee and club-hand.

deformity may also result from vicious union of a pathological fracture,
permanent displacement of an epiphysis, contracture, ankylosis, or
dislocation of the adjacent joint.

#relapsing osteomyelitis.#--as the term indicates, the various forms of
relapsing osteomyelitis date back to an antecedent attack, and their
occurrence depends on the capacity of staphylococci to lie latent in the
marrow.

relapse may take place within a few months of the original attack, or
not for many years. cases are sometimes met with in which relapses recur
at regular intervals for several years, the tendency, however, being for
the attacks to become milder as the virulence of the organisms becomes
more and more attenuated.

_clinical features._--osteomyelitis in a patient over twenty-five is
nearly always of the relapsing variety. in some cases the bone becomes
enlarged, with pain and tenderness on pressure; in others there are the
usual phenomena which attend suppuration, but the pus is slow in coming
to the surface, and the constitutional symptoms are slight. the pus may
escape by new channels, or one of the old sinuses may re-open.
radiograms usually furnish useful information as to the condition of the
bone, both as it is altered by the original attack and by the changes
that attend the relapse of the infective process.

_treatment._--in cases of thickening of the bone with persistent and
severe pain, if relief is not afforded by the repeated application of
blisters, the thickened periosteum should be incised, and the bone
opened up with the chisel or trephine. in cases attended with
suppuration, the swelling is incised and drained, and if there is a
sequestrum, it must be removed.

#circumscribed abscess of bone--"brodie's abscess."#--the most important
form of relapsing osteomyelitis is the circumscribed abscess of bone
first described by benjamin brodie. it is usually met with in young
adults, but we have met with it in patients over fifty. several years
may intervene between the original attack of osteomyelitis and the onset
of symptoms of abscess.

_morbid anatomy._[7]--the abscess is nearly always situated in the
central axis of the bone in the region of the ossifying junction,
although cases are occasionally met with in which it lies nearer the
middle of the shaft. in exceptional cases there is more than one abscess
(fig. 120). the tibia is the bone most commonly affected, but the lower
end of the femur, or either end of the humerus, may be the seat of the
abscess. in the quiescent stage the lesion is represented by a small
cavity in the bone, filled with clear serum, and lined by a fibrous
membrane which is engaged in forming bone. around the cavity the bone is
sclerosed, and the medullary canal is obliterated. when the infection
becomes active, the contents of the cavity are transformed into a
greenish-yellow pus from which the staphylococcus can be isolated, and
the cavity is lined by a thin film of granulation tissue which erodes
the surrounding bone and so causes the abscess to increase in size. if
the erosion proceeds uniformly, the cavity is spherical or oval; if it
is more active at some points than others, diverticula or tunnels are
formed, and one of these may finally erupt through the shell of the bone
or into an adjacent joint. small irregular sequestra are occasionally
found within the abscess cavity. in long-standing cases it is common to
find extensive obliteration of the medullary canal, and a considerable
increase in the girth of the bone.

[7] alexis thomson, _edin. med. journ._, 1906.

[illustration: fig. 120.--segment of tibia resected for brodie's
abscess. the specimen shows two separate abscesses in the centre of the
shaft, the lower one quiescent, the upper one active and increasing in
size.]

the size of the abscess ranges from that of a cherry to that of a
walnut, but specimens in museums show that, if left to nature, the
abscess may attain much greater dimensions.

the affected bone is not only thicker and heavier than normal, but may
also be curved or otherwise deformed as a result of the original attack
of osteomyelitis.

the _clinical features_ are almost exclusively local. pain, due to
tension within the abscess, is the dominant symptom. at first it is
vague and difficult to localise, later it is referred to the interior of
the bone, and is described as "boring." it is aggravated by use of the
limb, and there are often, especially during the night, exacerbations in
which the pain becomes excruciating. in the early stages there are
periods of days or weeks during which the symptoms abate, but as the
abscess increases these become shorter, until the patient is hardly ever
free from pain. localised tenderness can almost always be elicited by
percussion, or by compressing the bone between the fingers and thumb.
the pain induced by the traction of muscles attached to the bone, or by
the weight of the body, may interfere with the function of the limb, and
in the lower extremity cause a limp in walking. the limb may be disabled
from _involvement of the adjacent joint_, in which there may be an
intermittent hydrops which comes and goes coincidently with
exacerbations of pain; or the abscess may perforate the joint and set up
an acute arthritis.

the _diagnosis_ of brodie's abscess from other affections met with at
the ends of long bones, and particularly from tuberculosis, syphilis,
and new growths, is made by a consideration of the previous history,
especially with reference to an antecedent attack of osteomyelitis. when
the adjacent joint is implicated, the surgeon may be misled by the
patient referring all the symptoms to the joint.

the x-ray picture is usually diagnostic chiefly because all the lesions
which are liable to be confused with brodie's abscess--gumma, tubercle,
myeloma, chondroma, and sarcoma--give a well-marked central clear area;
the sclerosis around brodie's abscess gives a dense shadow in which the
central clear area is either not seen at all or only faintly (fig. 121).

_treatment._--if an abscess is suspected, there should be no hesitation
in exploring the interior of the bone. it is exposed by a suitable
incision; the periosteum is reflected and the bone is opened up by a
trephine or chisel, and the presence of an abscess may be at once
indicated by the escape of pus. if, owing to the small size of the
abscess or the density of the bone surrounding it, the pus is not
reached by this procedure, the bone should be drilled in different
directions.

[illustration: fig. 121.--radiogram of brodie's abscess in lower end of
tibia.]

#other forms of acute osteomyelitis.#--among the less severe forms of
osteomyelitis resulting from the action of attenuated organisms are the
_serous_ variety, in which an effusion of serous fluid forms under the
periosteum; and _growth fever_, in which the child complains of vague
evanescent pains (growing pains), and of feeling tired and disinclined
to play; there may be some rise of temperature in the evening.

infection with the _staphylococcus albus_, the _streptococcus_, or the
_pneumococcus_ also causes a mild form of osteomyelitis which may go on
to suppuration.

_necrosis without suppuration_, described by paget under the name "quiet
necrosis," is a rare disease, and would appear to be associated with an
attenuated form of staphylococcal infection (tavel). it occurs in
adults, being met with up to the age of fifty or sixty, and is
characterised by the insidious development of a swelling which involves
a considerable extent of a long bone. the pain varies in intensity, and
may be continuous or intermittent, and there is tenderness on pressure.
the shaft is increased in girth as a result of its being surrounded by a
new case of bone. the resemblance to sarcoma may be very close, but the
swelling is not as defined as in sarcoma, nor does it ever assume the
characteristic "leg of mutton" shape. in both diseases there is a
tendency to pathological fracture. it is difficult also in the absence
of skiagrams to differentiate the condition from syphilitic and from
tuberculous disease. if the diagnosis is not established after
examination with the x-rays, an exploratory incision should be made; if
dead bone is found, it is removed.

in typhoid fever the bone marrow is liable to be invaded by _the typhoid
bacillus_, which may set up osteomyelitis soon after its lodgment, or it
may lie latent for a considerable period before doing so. the lesions
may be single or multiple, they involve the marrow or the periosteum or
both, and they may or may not be attended with suppuration. they are
most commonly met with in the tibia and in the ribs at the
costo-chondral junctions.

the bone lesions usually occur during the seventh or eighth week of the
fever, but have been known to occur much later. the chief complaint is
of vague pains, at first referred to several bones, later becoming
localised in one; they are aggravated by movement, or by handling the
bone, and are worst at night. there is redness and oedema of the
overlying soft parts, and swelling with vague fluctuation, and on
incision there escapes a yellow creamy pus, or a brown syrupy fluid
containing the typhoid bacillus in pure culture. necrosis is
exceptional.

when the abscess develops slowly, the condition resembles tuberculous
disease, from which it may be diagnosed by the history of typhoid fever,
and by obtaining a positive widal reaction.

the prognosis is favourable, but recovery is apt to be slow, and relapse
is not uncommon.

it is usually sufficient to incise the periosteum, but when the disease
occurs in a rib it may be necessary to resect a portion of bone.

#pyogenic osteomyelitis due to spread of infection from the soft
parts.#--there still remain those forms of osteomyelitis which result
from infection through a wound involving the bone--for example, compound
fractures, gun-shot injuries, osteotomies, amputations, resections, or
operations for un-united fracture. in all of these the marrow is exposed
to infection by such organisms as are present in the wound. a similar
form of osteomyelitis may occur apart from a wound--for example,
infection may spread to the jaws from lesions of the mouth; to the
skull, from lesions of the scalp or of the cranial bones
themselves--such as a syphilitic gumma or a sarcoma which has fungated
externally; or to the petrous temporal, from suppuration in the middle
ear.

the most common is an osteomyelitis commencing in the marrow exposed in
a wound infected with pyogenic organisms. in amputation stumps,
fungating granulations protrude from the sawn end of the bone, and if
necrosis takes place, the sequestrum is annular, affecting the
cross-section of the bone at the saw-line; or tubular, extending up the
shaft, and tapering off above. the periosteum is more easily detached,
is thicker than normal, and is actively engaged in forming bone. in the
macerated specimen, the new bone presents a characteristic coral-like
appearance, and may be perforated by cloacae (fig. 122).

[illustration: fig. 122.--tubular sequestrum resulting from septic
osteomyelitis in amputation stump.]

like other pyogenic infections, it may terminate in pyaemia, as a result
of septic phlebitis in the marrow.

the _clinical features_ of osteomyelitis in _an amputation stump_ are
those of ordinary pyogenic infection; the involvement of the bone may be
suspected from the clinical course, the absence of improvement from
measures directed towards overcoming the sepsis in the soft parts, and
the persistence of suppuration in spite of free drainage, but it is not
recognised unless the bone is exposed by opening up the stump or the
changes in the bone are shown by the x-rays. the first change is due to
the deposit of new bone on the periosteal surface; later, there is the
shadow of the sequestrum.

healing does not take place until the sequestrum is extruded or removed
by operation.

_in compound fractures_, if a fragment dies and forms a sequestrum, it
is apt to be walled in by new bone; the sinuses continue to discharge
until the sequestrum is removed. even after healing has taken place,
relapse is liable to occur, especially in gun-shot injuries. months or
years afterwards, the bone may become painful and tender. the symptoms
may subside under rest and elevation of the limb and the application of
a compress, or an abscess forms and bursts with comparatively little
suffering. the contents may be clear yellow serum or watery pus;
sometimes a small spicule of bone is discharged. valuable information,
both for diagnosis and treatment, is afforded by skiagrams.

tuberculous disease

the tuberculous diseases of bone result from infection of the marrow or
periosteum by tubercle bacilli conveyed through the arteries; it is
exceedingly rare for tubercle to appear in bone as a primary infection,
the bacilli being usually derived from some pre-existing focus in the
bronchial glands or elsewhere. according to the observations of john
fraser, 60 per cent. of the cases of bone and joint tubercle in children
are due to the bovine bacillus, 37 per cent. to the human variety, and
in 3 per cent. both types are present.

tuberculous disease in bone is characterised by its insidious onset and
slow progress, and by the frequency with which it is associated with
disease of the adjacent joint.

#periosteal tuberculosis# is met with in the ribs, sternum, vertebral
column, skull, and less frequently in the long bones of the limbs. it
may originate in the periosteum, or may spread thence from the marrow,
or from synovial membrane.

_in superficial bones_, such as the sternum, the formation of
tuberculous granulation tissue in the deeper layer of the periosteum,
and its subsequent caseation and liquefaction, is attended by the
insidious development of a doughy swelling, which is not as a rule
painful, although tender on pressure. while the swelling often remains
quiescent for some time, it tends to increase in size, to become boggy
or fluctuating, and to assume the characters of a cold abscess. the pus
perforates the fibrous layer of the periosteum, invading and infecting
the overlying soft parts, its spread being influenced by the anatomical
arrangement of the tissues. the size of the abscess affords no
indication of the extent of the bone lesion from which it originates. as
the abscess reaches the surface, the skin becomes of a dusky red or
livid colour, is gradually thinned out, and finally sloughs, forming a
sinus. a probe passed into the sinus strikes carious bone. small
sequestra may be found embedded in the granulation tissue. the sinus
persists as long as any active tubercle remains in the tissues, and is
apt to form an avenue for pyogenic infection.

_in deeply seated bones_, such as the upper end of the femur, the
formation of a cold abscess in the soft parts is often the first
evidence of the disease.

_diagnosis._--before the stage of cold abscess is reached, the localised
swelling is to be differentiated from a gumma, from chronic forms of
staphylococcal osteomyelitis, from enlarged bursa or ganglion, from
sub-periosteal lipoma, and from sarcoma. most difficulty is met with in
relation to periosteal sarcoma, which must be differentiated either by
the x-ray appearances or by an exploratory incision.

_x-ray appearances in periosteal tubercle_: the surface of the cortical
bone in the area of disease is roughened and irregular by erosion, and
in the vicinity there may be a deposit of new bone on the surface,
particularly if a sinus is present and mixed infection has occurred; in
_syphilis_ the shadow of the bone is denser as a result of sclerosis,
and there is usually more new bone on the surface--hyperostosis; in
_periosteal sarcoma_ there is greater erosion and consequently greater
irregularity in the contour of the cortical bone, and frequently there
is evidence of formation of bone in the form of characteristic spicules
projecting from the surface at a right angle.

the early recognition of periosteal lesions in the articular ends of
bones is of importance, as the disease, if left to itself, is liable to
spread to the adjacent joint.

the _treatment_ is that of tuberculous lesions in general; if
conservative measures fail, the choice lies between the injection of
iodoform, and removal of the infected tissues with the sharp spoon. in
the ribs it is more satisfactory to remove the diseased portion of bone
along with the wall of the associated abscess or sinus. if all the
tubercle has been removed and there is no pyogenic infection, the wound
is stitched up with the object of obtaining primary union; otherwise it
is treated by the open method.

#tuberculous osteomyelitis.#--tuberculous lesions in the marrow occur as
isolated or as multiple foci of granulation tissue, which replace the
marrow and erode the trabeculae of bone in the vicinity (fig. 124). the
individual focus varies in size from a pea to a walnut. the changes that
ensue resemble in character those in other tissues, and the extent of
the destruction varies according to the way in which the tubercle
bacillus and the marrow interact upon one another. the granulation
tissue may undergo caseation and liquefaction, or may become
encapsulated by fibrous tissue--"encysted tubercle."

[illustration: fig. 124.--tuberculous osteomyelitis of os magnum,
excised from a boy aet. 8. note well-defined caseous focus, with several
minute foci in surrounding marrow.]

sometimes the tuberculous granulation tissue spreads in the marrow,
assuming the characters of a diffuse infiltration--diffuse tuberculous
osteomyelitis. the trabecular framework of the bone undergoes erosion
and absorption--rarefying ostitis--and either disappears altogether or
only irregular fragments or sequestra of microscopic dimensions remain
in the area affected. less frequently the trabecular framework is added
to by the formation of new bone, resulting in a remarkable degree of
sclerosis, and if, following upon this, there is caseation of the
tubercle and death of the affected portion of bone, there results a
sequestrum often of considerable size and characteristic shape, which,
because of the sclerosis and surrounding endarteritis, is exceedingly
slow in separating. when the sequestrum involves an articular surface it
is often wedge-shaped; in other situations it is rounded or truncated
and lies in the long axis of the medullary canal (fig. 125). finally,
the sequestrum lies loose in a cavity lined by tuberculous granulation
tissue, and is readily identified in a radiogram. this type of sclerosis
preceding death of the bone is highly characteristic of tuberculosis.

[illustration: fig. 125.--tuberculous disease of child's tibia,
showing sequestrum in medullary cavity, and increase in girth from
excess of new bone.]

_clinical features._--as a rule, it is only in superficially placed
bones, such as the tibia, ulna, clavicle, mandible, or phalanges, that
tuberculous disease in the marrow gives rise to signs sufficiently
definite to allow of its clinical recognition. in the vertebrae, or in
the bones of deeply seated joints, such as the hip or shoulder, the
existence of tuberculous lesions in the marrow can only be inferred from
indirect signs--such, for example, as rigidity and curvature in the case
of the spine, or from the symptoms of grave and persistent joint-disease
in the case of the hip or shoulder.

with few exceptions, tuberculous disease in the interior of a bone does
not reveal its presence until by extension it reaches one or other of
the surfaces of the bone. in the shaft of a long bone its eruption on
the periosteal surface is usually followed by the formation of a cold
abscess in the overlying soft parts. when situated in the articular ends
of bones, the disease more often erupts in relation to the reflection of
the synovial membrane or directly on the articular surface--in either
case giving rise to disease of the joint (fig. 156).

[illustration: fig. 126.--diffuse tuberculous osteomyelitis of right
tibia.

(photograph lent by sir h. j. stiles.)]

#diffuse tuberculous osteomyelitis in the shaft of a long bone# is
comparatively rare, and has been observed chiefly in the tibia and the
ulna in children (fig. 126). it commences at the growing extremity of
the diaphysis, and spreads along the medulla to a variable extent; it is
attended by the formation of vascular and porous bone on the surface,
which causes thickening of the diaphysis; this is most marked at the
ossifying junction and tapers off along the shaft. the infection not
only spreads along the medulla, but it invades the spongy bone
surrounding this, and then the cortical bone, and is only prevented from
reaching the soft parts by the new bone formed by the periosteum. the
bone is replaced by granulation tissue, and disappears, or part of it
may become sclerosed and in time form a sequestrum. in the macerated
specimen, the sequestrum appears small in proportion to the large cavity
in which it lies. all these changes are revealed in a good skiagram,
which not only confirms the diagnosis, but, in many instances,
demonstrates the extent of the disease, the presence or absence of a
sequestrum, and the amount of new bone on the surface. finally the
periosteum gives way, and an abscess forms in the soft parts; and if
left to itself ruptures externally, leaving a sinus. the most
satisfactory _treatment_ is to resect sub-periosteally the diseased
portion of the diaphysis.

_in cancellous bones, such as those of the tarsus_, there is a similar
caseous infiltration in the marrow, and this may be attended with the
formation of a sequestrum either in the interior of the bone or
involving its outer shell, as shown in fig. 127. the situation and
extent of the disease are shown in x-ray photographs. after the
tuberculous granulation tissue erupts through the cortex of the bone, it
gives rise to a cold abscess or infects adjacent joints or tendon
sheaths.

[illustration: fig. 127.--advanced tuberculous disease in region of
ankle. the ankle-joint is ankylosed, and there is a large sequestrum in
the calcaneus.

(specimen in anatomical museum, university of edinburgh.)]

if an exact diagnosis is made at an early stage of the disease--and this
is often possible with the aid of x-rays--the affected bone is excised
sub-periosteally or its interior is cleared out with the sharp spoon and
gouge, the latter procedure being preferred in the case of the
_calcaneus_ to conserve the stability of the heel. when several bones
and joints are simultaneously affected, and there are sinuses with
mixed infection, amputation is usually indicated, especially in adults.

#tuberculous dactylitis# is the name applied to a diffuse form of the
disease as it affects the phalanges, metacarpal or metatarsal bones. the
lesion presents, on a small scale, all the anatomical changes that have
been described as occurring in the medulla of the tibia or ulna, and
they are easily followed in skiagrams. a periosteal type of dactylitis
is also met with.

the _clinical features_ are those of a spindle-shaped swelling of a
finger or toe, indolent, painless, and interfering but little with the
function of the digit. recovery may eventually occur without
suppuration, but it is common to have the formation of a cold abscess,
which bursts and forms one or more sinuses. it may be difficult to
differentiate tuberculous dactylitis from the enlargement of the
phalanges in inherited syphilis (syphilitic dactylitis), especially when
the tuberculous lesion occurs in a child who is the subject of inherited
syphilis.

[illustration: fig. 128.--tuberculous dactylitis.]

in the syphilitic lesion, skiagrams usually show a more abundant
formation of new bone, but in many cases the doubt is only cleared up by
observing the results of the tuberculin test or the effects of
anti-syphilitic treatment.

sarcoma of a phalanx or metacarpal bone may closely resemble a
dactylitis both clinically and in skiagrams, but it is rare.

_treatment._--recovery under conservative measures is not uncommon, and
the functional results are usually better than those following upon
operative treatment, although in either case the affected finger is
liable to be dwarfed (fig. 129). the finger should be immobilised in a
splint, and a bier's bandage applied to the upper arm. operative
interference is indicated if a cold abscess develops, if there is a
persistent sinus, or if a sequestrum has formed, a point upon which
information is obtained by examination with the x-rays. when a toe is
affected, amputation is the best treatment, but in the case of a finger
it is rarely called for. in the case of a metacarpal or metatarsal bone,
sub-periosteal resection is the procedure of choice, saving the
articular ends if possible.

[illustration: fig. 129.--shortening of middle finger of adult, the
result of tuberculous dactylitis in childhood.]


syphilitic disease

syphilitic affections of bone may be met with at any period of the
disease, but the graver forms occur in the tertiary stage of acquired
and inherited syphilis. the virus is carried by the blood-stream to all
parts of the skeleton, but the local development of the disease appears
to be influenced by a predisposition on the part of individual bones.

syphilitic diseases of bone are much less common in practice than those
due to pyogenic and tuberculous infectious, and they show a marked
predilection for the tibia, sternum, and skull. they differ from
tuberculous affections in the frequency with which they attack the
shafts of bones rather than the articular ends, and in the comparative
rarity of joint complications.

_evanescent periostitis_ is met with in acquired syphilis during the
period of the early skin eruptions. the patient complains, especially at
night, of pains over the frontal bone, ribs, sternum, tibiae, or ulnae.
localised tenderness is elicited on pressure, and there is slight
swelling, which, however, rarely amounts to what may be described as a
_periosteal node_.

in the later stages of acquired syphilis, _gummatous periostitis and
osteomyelitis_ occur, and are characterised by the formation in the
periosteum and marrow of circumscribed gummata or of a diffuse gummatous
infiltration. the framework of the bone is rarefied in the area
immediately involved, and sclerosed in the parts beyond. if the
gummatous tissue degenerates and breaks down, and especially if the
overlying skin is perforated and septic infection is superadded, the
bone disintegrates and exhibits the condition known as _syphilitic
caries_; sometimes a portion of bone has its blood supply so far
interfered with that it dies--_syphilitic necrosis_. syphilitic
sequestra are heavier and denser than normal bone, because sclerosis
usually precedes death of the bone. the bones especially affected by
gummatous disease are: the skull, the septum of the nose, the nasal
bones, palate, sternum, femur, tibia, and the bones of the forearm.

_in the bones of the skull_, gummata may form in the peri-cranium,
diploe, or dura mater. an isolated gumma forms a firm elastic swelling,
shading off into the surroundings. in the macerated bone there is a
depression or an actual perforation of the calvaria; multiple gummata
tend to fuse with one another at their margins, giving the appearance of
a combination of circles: these sometimes surround an area of bone and
cut it off from its blood supply (fig. 130). if the overlying skin is
destroyed and septic infection superadded, such an isolated area of bone
is apt to die and furnish a sequestrum; the separation of the dead bone
is extremely slow, partly from the want of vascularity in the sclerosed
bone round about, and partly from the density of the sequestrum. in
exceptional cases the necrosis involves the entire vertical plate of the
frontal bone. pus is formed between the bone and the dura (suppurative
pachymeningitis), and this may be followed by cerebral abscess or by
pyaemia. gummatous disease in the wall of the orbit may cause
displacement of the eye and paralysis of the ocular muscles.

[illustration: fig. 130.--syphilitic disease of skull, showing a
sequestrum in process of separation.]

on the inner surface of the skull, the formation of gummatous tissue may
cause pressure on the brain and give rise to intense pain in the head,
jacksonian epilepsy, or paralysis, the symptoms varying with the seat
and extent of the disease. the cranial nerves may be pressed upon at the
base, especially at their points of exit, and this gives rise to
symptoms of irritation or paralysis in the area of distribution of the
nerves affected.

_in the septum of the nose, the nasal bones, and the hard palate_,
gummatous disease causes ulceration, which, beginning in the mucous
membrane, spreads to the bones, and being complicated with septic
infection leads to caries and necrosis. in the nose, the disease is
attended with stinking discharge (ozoena), the extrusion of portions of
dead bone, and subsequently with deformity characterised by loss of the
bridge of the nose; in the palate, it is common to have a perforation,
so that the air escapes through the nose in speaking, giving to the
voice a characteristic nasal tone.

_syphilitic disease of the tibia_ may be taken as the type of the
affection as it occurs _in the long bones_. gummatous disease in the
periosteum may be localised and result in the formation of a
well-defined node, or the whole shaft may become the seat of an
irregular nodular enlargement (fig. 132). if the bone is macerated, it
is found to be heavier and bulkier than normal; there is diffuse
sclerosis with obliteration of the medullary canal, and the surface is
uneven from heaping up of new bone--hyperostosis (fig. 131). if a
periosteal gumma breaks down and invades the skin, a syphilitic ulcer is
formed with carious bone at the bottom. a central gumma may eat away the
surrounding bone to such an extent that the shaft undergoes pathological
fracture. in the rare cases in which it attacks the articular end of a
long bone, gummatous disease may implicate the adjacent joint and give
rise to syphilitic arthritis.

[illustration: fig. 131.--syphilitic hyperostosis and sclerosis of
tibia, on section and on surface view.]

_clinical features._--there is severe boring pain--as if a gimlet were
being driven into the bone. it is worst at night, preventing sleep, and
has been ascribed to compression of the nerves in the narrowed haversian
canals.

the _periosteal gumma_ appears as a smooth, circumscribed swelling which
is soft and elastic in the centre and firm at the margins, and shades
off into the surrounding bone. the gumma may be completely absorbed or
it may give place to a hard node. in some cases the gumma softens in the
centre, the skin becomes adherent, thin, and red, and finally gives way.
the opening in the skin persists as a sinus, or develops into a typical
ulcer with irregular, crescentic margins; in either case a probe reveals
the presence of carious bone or of a sequestrum. the health may be
impaired as a result of mixed infection, and the absorption of toxins
and waxy degeneration in the viscera may ultimately be induced.

a _central gumma_ in a long bone may not reveal its presence until it
erupts through the shell and reaches the periosteal surface or invades
an adjacent joint. sometimes the first manifestation is a fracture of
the bone produced by slight violence.

in radiograms the appearance of syphilitic bones is usually
characteristic. when there is hyperostosis and sclerosis, the shaft
appears denser and broader than normal, and the contour is uneven or
wavy. when there is a central gumma, the shadow is interrupted by a
rounded clear area, like that of a chondroma or myeloma, but there is
sclerosis round about.

_diagnosis._--the conditions most liable to be mistaken for syphilitic
disease of bone are chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis, tuberculosis,
and sarcoma; and the diagnosis is to be made by the history and progress
of the disease, the result of examination with the x-rays, and the
results of specific tests and treatment.

_treatment._--the general health is to be improved by open air, by
nourishing food, and by the administration of cod-liver oil, iron, and
arsenic. anti-syphilitic remedies should be given, and if they are
administered before there is any destruction of tissue, the benefit
derived from them is usually marked.

radiograms show the rapid absorption of the new bone both on the surface
and in the marrow, and are of value in establishing the therapeutic
diagnosis.

in certain cases, and particularly when there are destructive changes in
the bone complicated with pyogenic infection, specific remedies have
little effect. in cases of persistent or relapsing gummatous disease
with ulceration of skin, it is often necessary to remove the diseased
soft parts with the sharp spoon and scissors, and to gouge or chisel
away the unhealthy bone, on the same lines as in tuberculous disease.
when hyperostosis and sclerosis of the bone is attended with severe pain
which does not yield to blistering, the periosteum may be incised and
the sclerosed bone perforated with a drill or trephine.

#lesions of bone in inherited syphilis.#--_craniotabes_, in which the
flat bones of the skull undergo absorption in patches, was formerly
regarded as syphilitic, but it is now known to result from prolonged
malnutrition from any cause. _bossing of the skull_ resulting in the
formation of parrot's nodes is also being withdrawn from the category of
syphilitic affections. the lesions in infancy--epiphysitis, bossing of
the skull, and craniotabes--have been referred to in the chapter on
inherited syphilis.

_epiphysitis or syphilitic perichondritis._--the first of these terms is
misleading, because the lesion involves the ossifying junction and the
shaft of the bone, and the epiphysis only indirectly. the young bone is
replaced by granulation tissue, so that large clear areas are seen with
the x-rays. the symptoms are referred to the joint, because it is there
that the muscles are inserted and drag on the perichondrium when
movement occurs; swelling is most marked in the vicinity of the joint,
and it may be added to by effusion into the synovial cavity. the baby,
usually under six months, is noticed to be feverish and fretful and to
cry when touched. the mother discovers that the pain is caused by moving
a particular limb, usually the arm, as the humerus, radius, and ulna are
the bones most commonly affected; the limb, moreover, hangs useless at
the side as if paralysed, and the condition was formerly described as
_syphilitic pseudo-paralysis_.

the lesions met with later correspond to those of the tertiary period of
the acquired disease, but as they affect bones which are still actively
growing, the effects are more striking. gummatous disease may come and
go over periods of many years, with the result that the external
appearance and architectural arrangement of a long bone come to be
profoundly altered. in the tibia, for example, the shaft is bowed
forward in a gentle curve, which is compared to the curve of a
sabre--"sabre-blade" deformity (fig. 132). the diffuse thickening all
round the bone obscures the sharp margins so that the bone becomes
circular in section and the anterior and mesial edges are blunted, and
the comparison to a cucumber is deserved. in some cases the tibia is
actually increased in length as well as in girth.

[illustration: fig. 132.--sabre-blade deformity of left tibia in
inherited syphilis.

(from a photograph lent by sir george t. beatson.)]

the contrast between the grossly enlarged and misshapen tibia and the
normal or even attenuated fibula is a striking one.

_treatment_ is carried out on lines similar to those recommended in the
acquired disease. when curving of the tibia causes disability in
walking, the bone may be straightened by a cuneiform resection.

_syphilitic dactylitis_ is met with chiefly in children. it may affect
any of the fingers or toes, but is commonest in the first phalanx of the
index-finger or of the thumb. several fingers may be attacked at the
same time or in succession. the lesion consists in a gummatous
infiltration of the soft parts surrounding the phalanx, or a gummatous
osteomyelitis, but there is practically no tendency to break down and
discharge, or to the formation of a sequestrum as is so common in
tuberculous dactylitis.

the finger becomes the seat of a swelling, which is more evident on the
dorsal aspect, and, according to the distribution and extent of the
disease, it is acorn-shaped, fusiform, or cylindrical. it is firm and
elastic, and usually painless. the movements are impaired, especially if
the joints are involved. in its early stages the disease is amenable to
anti-syphilitic treatment, and complete recovery is the rule.


hydatid disease

this rare disease results from the lodgment of the embryos of the taenia
echinoccus, which are conveyed to the marrow by the blood-stream. the
cysts are small, usually about the size of a pin-head, and they are
present in enormous numbers scattered throughout the marrow. the parts
of the skeleton most often affected are the articular ends of the long
bones, the bodies of the vertebrae, and the pelvis.

as the cysts increase in number and in size, the framework of the bone
is gradually absorbed, and there result excavations or cavities. the
marrow and spongy bone first disappear, the compact tissue then becomes
thin, and pathological fracture may result. the bone becomes expanded,
and the cysts may escape through perforations into the surrounding
cellular tissue, and when thus freed from confinement may attain
considerable dimensions. suppuration from superadded pyogenic infection
may be attended with extensive necrosis, and lead to disorganisation of
the adjacent joint.

_clinical features._--the patient complains of deep-seated pains. in
superficial bones, such as the tibia, there is enlargement, and it may
be possible to recognise egg-shell crackling, or unequal consistence of
the bone, which is hard in some parts, and doughy and elastic in others.
the disease may pursue an indolent course during months or years until
some complication occurs, such as suppuration or fracture. with the
occurrence of suppuration the disease becomes more active, and abscesses
may form in the soft parts and in the adjacent joint. in the vertebral
column, hydatids give rise to angular deformity and paraplegia. in the
pelvis, there is usually great enlargement of the bones, and when
suppuration occurs it is apt to infect the hip-joint and to terminate
fatally.

examination with the x-rays shows the characteristic excavations of the
bone caused by the cysts. the disease is liable to be mistaken for
central tumour, gumma, tuberculosis, or abscess of bone.

the _treatment_ consists in thorough eradication of the parasite by
operation. the bone is laid open and scraped or resected according to
the extent of the disease, and the raw surfaces swabbed with 1 per cent.
formalin. in advanced cases complicated with spontaneous fracture or
with suppuration, amputation affords the best chance of recovery.

the lesions in the bones resulting from _actinomycosis_ and from
_mycetoma_, have been described with these diseases.


constitutional diseases attended with lesions in the bones

these include rickets, scurvy-rickets, osteomalacia, ostitis deformans,
osteomyelitis fibrosa, fragilitas ossium, and diseases of the nervous
system.


rickets

rickets or rachitis is a constitutional disease associated with
disturbance of nutrition, and attended with changes in the skeleton.
the disease is most common and most severe among the children of the
poorer classes in large cities, who are improperly fed and are brought
up in unhealthy surroundings. there is evidence that the most important
factors in the causation of rickets are ill-health of the mother during
pregnancy, and the administration to the child after its birth of food
which is defective in animal fat, proteids, and salts of lime, or which
contains these in such a form that they are not readily assimilated. the
occurrence of the disease is favoured, and its features are aggravated,
by imperfect oxygenation of the blood as the result of a deficiency of
fresh air and sunlight, want of exercise, and by other conditions which
prevail in the slums of large towns.

_pathological anatomy._--the most striking feature is the softness
(malacia) of the bones, due to excessive absorption of osseous tissue,
and the formation of an imperfectly calcified tissue at the sites of
ossification. the affected bones lose their rigidity, so that they are
bent under the weight of the body, by the traction of muscles, and by
other mechanical forces.

the _periosteum_ is thick and vascular, and when detached carries with
it plates and spicules of soft porous bone. the new bone may be so
abundant that it forms a thick crust on the surface, and in the flat
bones of the skull this may be heaped up in the form of bosses or ridges
resembling those ascribed to inherited syphilis.

in the epiphysial cartilages and at the ossifying junctions, all the
processes concerned in ossification, excepting the deposition of lime
salts, occur to an exaggerated degree. the cartilage of the epiphysial
disc proliferates actively and irregularly, so that it becomes softer,
thicker, and wider, and gives rise to a visible swelling, best seen at
the lower end of the radius and lower end of the tibia, and at the
costo-chondral junctions where the series of beaded swellings is known
as the "rickety rosary."

the ossifying zone is increased in depth; the marrow is abnormally
vascular; and the new bone that is formed is imperfectly calcified. the
result is that the bones may never attain their normal length, and they
remain stunted throughout life as in rickety dwarfs (fig. 133), or the
shafts may grow unequally and come to deviate from their normal axes as
in knock-knee and bow-knee.

[illustration: fig. 133.--skeleton of rickety dwarf, known as
"bowed joseph," leader of the meal riots in edinburgh, who died in 1780.

(anatomical museum, university of edinburgh.)]

these changes are well brought out in skiagrams; instead of the
well-defined narrow line which represents the epiphysial cartilage,
there is an ill-defined, blurred zone of considerable depth.

in the shafts of the long bones, owing to the excessive absorption of
bone, the cortex becomes porous, the spongy bone is rarefied, and the
bones readily bend or break under mechanical influences. when the
disease is arrested, a process of repair sets in which often results in
the bones becoming denser and heavier than normal. in the flat bones of
the skull, the absorption may result in the entire disappearance of
areas of bone, leaving a membrane which dimples like thin cardboard
under the pressure of the finger--a condition known as _craniotabes_.

_changes in the skeleton before the child is able to walk._--the
fontanelles remain open until the end of the second year or longer, and
the frontal and parietal eminences are unduly prominent. there is
sometimes hydrocephalus, and the head is characteristically enlarged.
the jaws are altered so that while the upper jaw is contracted into the
shape of a #v#, the lower jaw is square instead of rounded in outline,
and the teeth do not oppose one another. in the _thorax_, the chief
feature may be the beading at the costo-chondral junctions, principally
of the fifth and sixth ribs or its walls may be contracted,
particularly if respiration is interfered with as a result of bronchial
catarrh or adenoids. the contraction may take the form of a vertical
groove on each side, or of a horizontal groove at the level of the upper
end of the xiphi-sternum; when the sternum and cartilages form a
projection in front, the deformity is known as "pigeon-breast."

the _spine_ may be curved backwards--_kyphosis_--throughout its
whole extent or only in one part; or it may be curved to one
side--_scoliosis_.

in the _limbs_, the prominent features are the deficient growth in
length of the long bones, the enlargements at the epiphysial junctions,
and the bending, and occasional greenstick fracture, of the shafts. the
degree of enlargement of the epiphysial junctions is directly
proportionate to the amount of movement to which the bone is subjected
(john thomson). the curves at this stage depend on the attitude of the
child while sitting or being carried--for example, the arm bones become
bent in children who paddle about the floor with the aid of their arms;
and in a child who lies on its back with the lower limbs everted, the
weight of the limb may lead to curvature of the neck of the femur--coxa
vara. the clavicle or humerus may sustain greenstick fracture from the
child being lifted by the arms; the femur, by a fall. from the extreme
laxity of the ligaments, the joints can be moved beyond the normal
limits, and the child is often observed to twist its limbs into abnormal
attitudes.

_in children who have walked._--in these children the most important
deformities occur in the spine, pelvis, and lower extremities, and
result for the most part from yielding of the softened bones under the
weight of the body. scoliosis is the usual type of spinal curvature, and
in extreme cases it may lead to a pronounced form of hump-back. the
pelvis may remain small (_justo-minor pelvis_), or it may be contracted
in the sagittal plane (_flat pelvis_); when the bones are unusually
soft, the acetabular portions are pushed inwards by the femora bearing
the weight of the body, and the pelvis assumes the shape of a trefoil,
as in the malacia of women. the shaft of the femur is curved forwards
and laterally; the bones of the leg laterally as in bow-leg, or
forwards, or forwards and laterally just above the ankle. the
deformities at the knee (genu valgum, genu varum, and genu recurvatum),
and at the hip (coxa vara), will be described in the volume dealing with
the extremities.

the majority of cases seen in surgical practice suffer from the
deformities resulting from rickets rather than from the active disease.
the examination of a large series of children at different ages shows
that the deformities become less and less frequent with each year. those
who recover may ultimately show no trace of rickets, and this is
especially true of children who grow at the average rate; in those,
however, in whom growth is retarded, especially from the fifth to the
seventh year, the deformities are apt to be permanent. it may be noted
that the scoliosis due to rickets has little tendency towards recovery.

_treatment._--the treatment of the disease consists in regulating the
diet, improving the surroundings, and preventing deformity. phosphorus
in doses of 100th grain may be given dissolved in cod-liver oil, and
preparations of iron and lime may be added with advantage. to avoid
those postures which predispose to deformities, the child should lie as
much as possible. in the well-to-do classes this is readily accomplished
by the aid of a nurse and the use of a perambulator. in hospital
out-patients the child is kept off its feet by the use of a light wooden
splint applied to the lateral aspect of each lower extremity, and
extending from the pelvis to 6 inches beyond the sole.

when deformities are already present, the treatment depends upon whether
or not there is any prospect of the bone straightening naturally. under
five years of age this may, as a rule, be confidently expected; the
child should be kept off its feet, and the limbs bathed and massaged. in
children of five or six and upwards, the prospect of natural
straightening is a diminishing one, and it is more satisfactory to
correct the deformity by operation. in rickety curvature of the spine,
the child should lie on a firm mattress, or, to allow of its being taken
into the open air, upon a double thomas' splint extending from the
occiput to the heels; the muscles acting on the trunk should be braced
up by massage and appropriate exercises.

#late rickets# or #rachitis adolescentium# is met with at any age from
nine to seventeen, and is generally believed to be due to a
recrudescence of rickets which had been present in childhood. the
disease is not attended with any disturbance of the general health; the
pathological changes are the same as in infantile rickets, but are for
the most part confined to the ossifying junctions, especially those
which are most active during adolescence, for example at the knee-joint.
the patient is easily tired, complains of pain in the bones, and, unless
care is taken, deformity is liable to ensue. there can be no doubt that
adolescent rickets plays an important part in the production of the
deformities which occur at or near puberty, especially knock-knee and
bow-knee.

#scurvy-rickets# or #infantile scurvy#.--this disease, described by
barlow and cheadle, is met with in infants under two years who have been
brought up upon sterilised or condensed milk and other proprietary
foods, and is most common in the well-to-do classes. the haemorrhages,
which are so characteristic of the disease, are usually preceded for
some weeks by a cachectic condition, with listlessness and debility and
disinclination for movement. very commonly the child ceases to move one
of his lower limbs--pseudo-paralysis--and screams if it is touched; a
swelling is found over one of the bones, usually the femur, accompanied
by exquisite tenderness; the skin is tense and shiny, and there may be
some oedema. these symptoms are due to a sub-periosteal haemorrhage, and
associated with this there may be crepitus from separation of an
epiphysis, rarely from fracture of the shaft of the bone. x-ray
photographs show enlargement of the bone, the periosteum being raised
from the shaft and new bone formed in relation to it. haemorrhages also
occur into the skin, presenting the appearance of bruises, into the
orbit and conjunctiva, and from the mucous membranes.

the _treatment_ consists in correcting the errors in diet. the infant
should have a wet nurse or a plentiful supply of cow's milk in its
natural state. anti-scorbutics in the form of orange, lemon, or grape
juice, and of potatoes bruised down in milk, may be given.

#osteomalacia.#--the term osteomalacia includes a group of conditions,
closely allied to rickets, in which the bones of adults become soft and
yielding, so that they are unduly liable to bend or break.

one form occurs in _pregnant and puerperal women_, affecting most
commonly the pelvis and lumbar vertebrae, but sometimes the entire
skeleton. the lime salts are absorbed, the bones lose their rigidity and
bend under the weight of the body and other mechanical influences, with
the result that gross deformities are produced, particularly in the
pelvis, the lumbar spine, and the hip-joints.

_neuropathic_ forms occur in certain chronic diseases of the brain and
cord; in some cases the bones lose their lime salts and bend, in others
they become brittle.

_osteomalacia associated with new growths in the skeleton._--when
_secondary cancer_ is widely distributed throughout the skeleton, it is
associated with softening of the bones, as a result of which they
readily bend or break, and after death are easily cut with a knife. in
the disease known as _multiple myeloma_, the interior of the ribs,
sternum, and bodies of the vertebrae is occupied by a reddish gelatinous
pulp, the structure of which resembles sarcoma; the bones are reduced to
a mere shell, and may break on the slightest pressure; the urine
contains albumose, a substance resembling albumen but coagulating at a
comparatively low temperature (140 o f.), and the coagulum is
re-dissolved on boiling, and it is readily precipitated by hydrochloric
acid (bence-jones).

#ostitis deformans--paget's disease of bone.#--this rare disease was
first described by sir james paget in 1877. in the early stages, the
marrow is transformed into a vascular connective tissue; its bone-eating
functions are exaggerated, and the framework of the bone becomes
rarefied, so that it bends under pressure as in osteomalacia. in course
of time, however, new bone is formed in great abundance; it is at first
devoid of lime salts, but later becomes calcified, so that the bones
regain their rigidity. this formation of new bone is much in excess of
the normal, the bones become large and bulky, their surfaces rough and
uneven, their texture sclerosed in parts, and the medullary canal is
frequently obliterated. these changes are well brought out in x-ray
photographs. the curving of the long bones, which is such a striking
feature of the disease, may be associated with actual lengthening, and
the changes are sometimes remarkably symmetrical (fig. 135). the bones
forming the cranium may be enormously thickened, the sutures are
obliterated, the distinction into tables and diploe is lost, and, while
the general texture is finely porous, there may be areas as dense as
ivory (fig. 134).

[illustration: fig. 134.--changes in the skull resulting from ostitis
deformans.

(anatomical museum, university of edinburgh.)]

_clinical features._--the disease is usually met with in persons over
fifty years of age. it is insidious in its onset, and, the patient's
attention may be first attracted by the occurrence of vague pains in the
back or limbs; by the enlargement and bending of such bones as the tibia
or femur; or by a gradual increase in the size of the head,
necessitating the wearing of larger hats. when the condition is fully
developed, the attitude and general appearance are eminently
characteristic. the height is diminished, and, owing to the curving of
the lower limbs and spine, the arms appear unnaturally long; the head
and upper part of the spine are bent forwards; the legs are held apart,
slightly flexed at the knees, and are rotated out as well as curved; the
whole appearance suggests that of one of the large anthropoid apes. the
muscles of the limbs may waste to such an extent as to leave the large,
curved, misshapen bones covered only by the skin (fig. 135). in the
majority of cases the bones of the lower extremities are much earlier
and more severely affected than those of the upper extremity, but the
capacity of walking is usually maintained even in the presence of great
deformity. in a case observed by byrom bramwell, the patient suffered
from a succession of fractures over a period of years.

[illustration: fig. 135.--cadaver, illustrating the alterations in the
lower limbs resulting from ostitis deformans.]

the disease may last for an indefinite period, the general health
remaining long unaffected. in a considerable number of the recorded
cases one of the bones became the seat of sarcoma.

#osteomyelitis fibrosa.#--this comparatively rare disease, which was
first described by recklinghausen, presents many interesting features.
because of its causing deformities of the bones and an undue liability
to fracture, and being chiefly met with in adolescents, it is regarded
by some authors as a juvenile form of paget's disease. it may be
diffused throughout the skeleton--we have seen it in the skull and in
the bones of the extremities--or it may be confined to a single bone,
usually the femur, or, what is more remarkable, the condition may affect
a portion only of the shaft of a long bone and be sharply defined from
the normal bone in contact with it.

[illustration: fig. 136.--osteomyelitis fibrosa affecting femora in a
man aet. 19. the curving of the bones is due to multiple fractures.]

on longitudinal section of a long bone during the active stage of the
disease, the marrow is seen to be replaced by a vascular young
connective tissue which encroaches on the surrounding spongy bone,
reducing it to the slenderest proportions; the formation of bone from
the periosteum does not keep pace with the absorption and replacement
going on in the interior, and the cortex may be reduced to a thin shell
of imperfectly calcified bone which can be cut with a knife. the young
connective tissue which replaces the marrow is not unlike that seen in
osteomalacia; it is highly vascular and may show haemorrhages of various
date; there are abundant giant cells of the myeloma type, and
degeneration and liquefaction of tissue may result in the formation of
cysts, which, when they constitute a prominent feature, are responsible
for the name--_osteomyelitis fibrosa cystica_--sometimes applied to the
condition.

it would appear that most of the recorded cases of _cysts of bone_ owe
their origin to this disease, while the abundance of giant cells with
occasional islands of cartilage in the wall of such cysts is responsible
for the view formerly held that they owed their origin to the
liquefaction of a solid tumour, such as a myeloma, a chondroma, or even
a sarcoma. although the tissue elements in this disease resemble those
of a new growth arising in the marrow, they differ in their arrangement
and in their method of growth; there is no tendency to erupt through the
cortex of the bone, to invade the soft parts, or to give rise to
secondary growths.

_clinical features._--the onset of the disease is insidious, and
attention is usually first directed to it by the occurrence of fracture
of the shaft of one of the long bones--usually the femur--from violence
that would be insufficient to break a healthy bone. apart from fracture,
the great increase in the size of one of the long bones and its uneven
contour are sufficiently remarkable to suggest examination with the
x-rays, by means of which the condition is at once recognised. a
systematic examination of the other long bones will often reveal the
presence of the disease at a stage before the bone is altered
externally.

symmetrical bossing of the skull was present in the case shown in
figs. 136 and 137, and there were also scattered patches of brown
pigmentation of the skin of the face, neck, and trunk, similar to those
met with in generalised neuro-fibromatosis. apart from fracture, the
disease is recognised by the thickening and usually also by the curving
of the shafts of the long bones. it is easy to understand the curvature
of bones that have passed through a soft stage and also of those that
have been broken and badly united, but it is difficult to account for
the curvatures that have no such cause; for example, we have seen
marked curve of the radius in a forearm of which the ulna was quite
straight. the curvature probably resulted from exaggerated growth in
length.

[illustration: fig. 137.--radiogram of upper end of femur showing
appearances in osteomyelitis fibrosa.]

the x-ray appearances vary with the stage of the malady, not estimated
in time, for the condition is chronic and may become stationary, but
according to whether it is progressive or undergoing repair. the shadow
of the bone presents a poor contrast to the soft parts, and no trace of
its original architecture; in extreme cases the shadow of the femur
resembles an unevenly filled sausage (fig. 137); there is no cortical
layer, the interior shows no trabecular structure, and some of the many
clear areas are probably cysts. the condition extends right up to the
articular cartilage, or, in the case of adolescent bones, up to the
epiphysial cartilage.

_prognosis._--the condition does not appear to affect the general
health. the future is concerned with the local conditions, and,
especially in the case of the femur, with its liability to fracture; so
far as we know there is no time limit to this.

_treatment_ is confined to protecting the affected bone--usually the
femur--from injury. operative treatment may be required for lameness due
to a badly united fracture.

#neuropathic atrophy of bone.#--the conditions included under this
heading occur in association with diseases of the nervous system.

most importance attaches to the fragility of the bones met with in
general paralysis of the insane, locomotor ataxia, and other chronic
diseases of the brain and spinal cord. the bones are liable to be
fractured by forces which would be insufficient to break a healthy bone.
in _locomotor ataxia_ the fractures affect especially the bones of the
lower extremity, and may occur before there are any definite nerve
symptoms, but they are more often met with in the ataxic stage, when the
abrupt and uncontrolled movements of the limbs may play a part in their
causation. they may be unattended with pain, and may fail to unite; when
repair does take place, it is sometimes attended with an excessive
formation of callus. joint lesions of the nature of charcot's disease
may occur simultaneously with the alterations in the bones. in
_syringomyelia_ pathological fracture is not so frequent as in locomotor
ataxia; it is more likely to occur in the bones of the upper extremity,
and especially in the humerus. in some cases of _epilepsy_ the bones
break when the patient falls in a fit, and there is usually an
exaggerated amount of comminution.

in these affections the bones present no histological or chemical
alterations, and the x-ray shadow does not differ from the normal. it is
maintained, therefore, that the disposition to fracture does not depend
upon a fragility of the bone, but on the loss of the muscular sense and
of common sensation in the bones, as a result of which there is an
inability properly to throw the muscles into action and dispose the
limbs so as to place them under the most favourable conditions to meet
external violence.

#osteogenesis imperfecta#, #fragilitas ossium#, or #congenital
osteopsathyrosis#.--these terms are used to describe a condition in
which an undue fragility of the bones dates from intra-uterine life. it
may occur in several members of the same family. in severe cases,
intra-uterine fractures occur, and during parturition fresh fractures
are almost sure to be produced, so that at birth there is a combination
of recent fractures and old fractures united and partly united, with
bendings and thickenings of the bones. large areas of the cranial vault
may remain membranous.

after birth the predisposition to fracture continues, the bones are
easily broken, the fractures are attended with little or no pain, the
crepitus is soft, and although union may take place, it may be delayed
and be attended with excess of callus. cases have been observed in which
a child has sustained over a hundred fractures.

the bones show a feeble shadow with the x-rays, and appear thin and
atrophied; the medullary canal is increased at the expense of the
cortex.

in young infants in whom multiple fractures occur the prognosis as to
life is unfavourable, and no satisfactory treatment of the disease has
been formulated. if the patient survives, the tendency to fracture
gradually disappears.

#hypertrophic pulmonary osteo-arthropathy.#--this condition, which was
described by marie in 1890, is secondary to disease in the chest, such
as chronic phthisis, empyema, bronchiectasis, or sarcoma of the lung.

there is symmetrical enlargement and deformity of the hands and feet;
the shafts of the bones are thickened, and the soft tissues of the
terminal segments of the digits hypertrophied. the fingers come to
resemble drum-sticks, and the thumb the clapper of a bell. the nails are
convex, and incurved at their free ends, suggesting a resemblance to the
beak of a parrot. there is also enlargement of the lower ends of the
bones of the forearm and leg, and effusion into the wrist and
ankle-joints. skiagrams of the hands and feet show a deposit of new bone
along the shafts of the phalanges.


tumours of bone

new growths which originate in the skeleton are spoken of as _primary
tumours_; those which invade the bones, either by metastasis from other
parts of the body or by spread from adjacent tissues, as _secondary_. a
tumour of bone may grow from the cellular elements of the periosteum,
the marrow, or the epiphysial cartilage.

primary tumours are of the connective-tissue type, and are usually
solitary, although certain forms, such as the chondroma, may be multiple
from the outset.

_periosteal tumours_ are at first situated on one side of the bone, but
as they grow they tend to surround it completely. innocent periosteal
tumours retain the outer fibrous layer as a capsule. malignant tumours
tend to perforate the periosteal capsule and invade the soft parts.

_central_ or _medullary tumours_ as they increase in size replace the
surrounding bone, and simultaneously new bone is formed on the surface;
as this is in its turn absorbed, further bone is formed beneath the
periosteum, so that in time the bone is increased in girth, and is said
to be "expanded" by the growth in its interior.

#primary tumours--osteoma.#--when the tumour projects from the surface
of a bone it is called an _exostosis_. when growing from bones developed
in membrane, such as the flat bones of the skull, it is usually dense
like ivory, and the term _ivory exostosis_ is employed. when derived
from hyaline cartilage--for example, at the ends of the long bones--it
is known as a _cartilaginous exostosis_. this is invested with a cap of
cartilage from which it continues to grow until the skeleton attains
maturity.

an exostosis forms a rounded or mushroom-shaped tumour of limited size,
which may be either sessile or pedunculated, and its surface is smooth
or nodulated (figs. 138 and 139). a cartilaginous exostosis in the
vicinity of a joint may be invested with a synovial sac or bursa--the
so-called _exostosis bursata_. the bursa may be derived from the
synovial membrane of the adjacent joint with which its cavity sometimes
communicates, or it may be of adventitious origin; when it is the seat
of bursitis and becomes distended with fluid, it may mask the underlying
exostosis, which then requires a radiogram for its demonstration.

[illustration: fig. 138.--radiogram of right knee showing multiple
exostoses.]

_clinically_, the osteoma forms a hard, indolent tumour attached to a
bone. the symptoms to which it gives rise depend on its situation. in
the vicinity of a joint, it may interfere with movement; on the medial
side of the knee it may incapacitate the patient from riding. when
growing from the dorsum of the terminal phalanx of the great
toe--_subungual exostosis_--it displaces the nail, and may project
through its matrix at the point of the toe, while the soft parts over it
may be ulcerated from pressure (fig. 107). it incapacitates the patient
from wearing a boot. when it presses on a nerve-trunk it causes pains
and cramps. in the orbit it displaces the eyeball; in the nasal fossae
and in the external auditory meatus it causes obstruction, which may be
attended with ulceration and discharge. in the skull it may project
from the outer table, forming a smooth rounded swelling, or it may
project from the inner table and press upon the brain.

the diagnosis is to be made by the slow growth of the tumour, its
hardness, and by the shadow which it presents with the x-rays (fig. 138).

an osteoma which does not cause symptoms may be left alone, as it ceases
to grow when the skeleton is mature and has no tendency to change its
benign character. if causing symptoms, it is removed by dividing the
neck or base of the tumour with a chisel, care being taken to remove the
whole of the overlying cartilage. the dense varieties met with in the
bones of the skull present greater difficulties; if it is necessary to
remove them, the base or neck of the tumour is perforated in many
directions with highly tempered drills rotated by some form of engine,
and the division is completed with the chisel.

#multiple exostoses.#--this disease, which, by custom, is still placed
in the category of tumours, is to be regarded as a disorder of growth,
dating from intra-uterine life and probably due to a disturbance in the
function of the glands of internal secretion, the thyreoid being the one
which is most likely to be at fault (arthur keith). the disorder of
growth is confined to those elements of the skeleton where a core of
bone formed in cartilage comes to be encased in a sheath of bone formed
beneath the periosteum. to indicate this abnormality the name
_diaphysial aclasis_ has been employed by arthur keith at the suggestion
of morley roberts.

bones formed entirely in cartilage are exempt, namely, the tarsal and
carpal bones, the epiphyses of the long bones, the sternum, and the
bodies of the vertebrae. bones formed entirely in membrane, that is,
those of the face and of the cranial vault, are also exempt. the
disorder mainly affects the ossifying junctions of the long bones of the
extremities, the vertebral border of the scapula, and the cristal border
of the ilium.

_clinically_ the disease is attended with the gradual and painless
development during childhood or adolescence of a number of tumours or
irregular projections of bone, at the ends of the long bones, the
vertebral border of the scapula, and the cristal border of the ilium.
they exhibit a rough symmetry; they rarely attain any size; and they
usually cease growing when the skeleton attains maturity--the conversion
of cartilage into bone being then completed. while they originate from
the ossifying junctions of the long bones, they tend, as the shaft
increases in length, to project from the surface of the bone at some
distance from the ossifying junction and to "point" away from it. they
may cause symptoms by "locking" the adjacent joint or by pressing upon
nerve-trunks or blood vessels.

in a considerable proportion of cases, the disturbance of growth is
further manifested by dwarfing of the long bones; these are not only
deficient in length but are sometimes also curved and misshapen, which
accounts for the condition being occasionally confused with the
disturbances of growth resulting from rickets. in about one-third of the
recorded cases there is a dislocation of the head of the radius on one
or on both sides, a result of unequal growth between the bones of the
forearm.

[illustration: fig. 140.--multiple cartilaginous exostoses in a
man aet. 27. the scapular tumour projecting above the right clavicle has
taken on active growth and pressed injuriously on the cords of the
brachial plexus.]

in early adult life, one of the tumours, instead of undergoing
ossification, may take on active growth and exhibit the features of a
chondro-sarcoma, pressing injuriously upon adjacent structures (fig. 140)
and giving rise later to metastases in the lungs.

the _x-ray appearances_ of the bones affected are of a striking
character; apart from the outgrowths of bone or "tumours" there is
evident a widespread alteration in the internal architecture of the
bones, which suggests analogies with other disturbances of ossification
such as achondroplasia and osteomyelitis fibrosa. the condition is one
that runs in families, sometimes through several generations; we have
more than once seen a father and son together in the hospital
waiting-room.

as regards _treatment_, there is no indication for surgical interference
except when one or other tumour is a source of disability as by pressing
upon a nerve-trunk or by locking a joint, in which case it is easily
removed by chiselling through its neck.

[illustration: fig. 141.--multiple cartilaginous exostoses in a
man aet. 27, the same as in fig. 140.]

_diffuse osteoma, leontiasis ossea._--this rare affection was described
by virchow, and named leontiasis ossea because of the disfigurement to
which it gives rise. it usually commences in adolescence as a diffuse
overgrowth first of one and then of both maxillae; these bones are
enlarged in all directions and project on the face, and the nasal fossae
and the maxillary and frontal sinuses become filled up with bone, which
encroaches also on the orbital cavities. in addition to the hideous
deformity, the patient suffers from blocking of the nose, loss of smell,
and protrusion of the eyes, sometimes followed by loss of sight. the
condition is liable to spread to the zygomatic and frontal bones, the
vault of the skull, and to the mandible. the base of the skull is not
affected. the disease is of slow progress and may become arrested; life
may be prolonged for many years, or may be terminated by brain
complications or by intercurrent affections. in certain cases it is
possible to remove some of the more disfiguring of the bony masses.

a less aggressive form, confined to the maxilla on one side, is
sometimes met with, and, in a case of this variety under our own
observation, the disfigurement, which was the only subject of complaint,
was removed, after reflecting the soft parts, by paring away the excess
of bone; this is easily done as the bone is spongy, and at an early
stage, imperfectly calcified.

a remarkable form of _unilateral hypertrophy and diffuse osteoma of the
skull_, following the distribution of the fifth nerve, has seen
described by jonathan hutchinson and alexis thomson.

#chondroma.#--cartilaginous tumours, apart from those giving rise to
multiple exostoses, grow from the long bones and from the scapula,
ilium, ribs, or jaws. they usually project from the surface of the bone,
and may attain an enormous size; sometimes they grow in the interior of
a bone, the so-called _enchondroma_.

the hyaline cartilage composing the tumour frequently undergoes
myxomatous degeneration, resulting in the formation of a glairy,
semi-fluid jelly, and if this change takes place throughout the tumour
it comes to resemble a cyst. on the other hand, the cartilage may
undergo calcification or ossification. the most important transition of
all is that into sarcoma, the so-called _malignant chondroma_ or
_chondro-sarcoma_, which is associated with rapid increase in size,
and parts of the tumour may be carried off in the blood-stream and give
rise to secondary growths, especially in the lungs.

cases have been met with in which certain parts of the skeleton--only
those developed in cartilage--were so uniformly permeated with cartilage
that the condition has been described as a "chondromatosis" and is
regarded as dating from an early period of foetal life. unlike the
condition known as multiple cartilaginous exostoses, it is a malignant
disease.

[illustration: fig. 142.--multiple chondromas of phalanges and
metacarpals in a boy aet. 10 (cf. fig. 143).]

the chondroma is met with as a slowly growing tumour which is specially
common in the bones of the hand, often in a multiple form (figs. 142 and
144). the surface is smooth or lobulated, and in consistence the tumour
may be dense and elastic like normal cartilage, or may present areas of
softening, or of bony hardness. the skin moves freely over it, except in
relation to the bones of the fingers, where it may become adherent and
ulcerate, simulating the appearance of a malignant tumour. large tumours
growing from the bones of the extremities may implicate the main
vessels and nerves, either surrounding them or pressing on them.

portions of a chondroma, which have undergone calcification or
ossification, throw a dark shadow with the x-rays; unaltered cartilage
and myxomatous tissue appear as clear areas.

[illustration: fig. 143.--skiagram of multiple chondromas shown
in fig. 142.]

_treatment._--it is necessary to remove the whole tumour, and in
chondromas growing from the surface of the bone, especially if they are
pedunculated, this is comparatively easy. when a bone, such as the
scapula or mandible, is involved, it is better to excise the bone, or at
least the part of it which bears the tumour. in the case of central
tumours the shell of bone is removed over an area sufficient to allow of
the enucleation of the tumour, or the affected portion of bone is
resected. should there be evidence of malignancy, such as increased rate
of growth, a tube of radium should be inserted, and in advanced cases
with destruction of tissue, amputation may be called for.

[illustration: fig. 144.--multiple chondromas in hand of boy aet. 8]

in multiple chondromas of the hand in young subjects, it was formerly
the custom to amputate the limb; an attempt should be made to avoid this
by shelling out the larger tumours individually, and persevering with
the application of the x-rays or of radium to inhibit the growth of the
smaller ones.

chondromas springing from the pelvic bones usually arise in the region
of the sacro-iliac joint; they project into the pelvis and press on the
bladder and rectum, and on the sciatic and obturator nerves; sometimes
also on the iliac veins, causing oedema of the legs. they are liable to
take on malignant characters, and rarely lend themselves to complete
removal by operation.

#fibroma# is met with chiefly as a periosteal growth in relation to the
mouth and pharynx, the _simple epulis_ of the alveolar margin and the
_naso-pharyngeal polypus_ being the most common examples. we have met
with a fibroma in the interior of the lower end of the femur of an
adult, causing expansion of the bone with decided increase in girth and
liability to pathological fracture; it is possible that this represents
the cured stage of osteomyelitis fibrosa.

_myxoma_, _lipoma_, and _angioma_ of bone are all rare.

#myeloma.#--the myeloid tumour, which is sometimes classified with the
sarcomas, contains as its chief elements large giant cells, like those
normally present in the marrow. on section these tumours present a
brownish-red or chocolate colour, and, being highly vascular, are liable
to haemorrhages, and therefore also to pigmentation, and to the formation
of blood cysts. sometimes the arterial vessels are so dilated as to
impart to the tumour an aneurysmal pulsation and bruit. the enlargement
or "expansion" of the bone results in the cortex being represented by a
thin shell of bone, which may crackle on pressure--parchment or
egg-shell crackling.

the myeloma is most often met with between the ages of twenty-five and
forty in the upper end of the tibia or lower end of the femur. it grows
slowly and causes little pain, and may long escape recognition unless an
examination is made with the x-rays. although these tumours have been
known to give rise to metastases, they are, as a rule, innocent and are
to be treated as such. when located in the shaft of a long bone,
pathological fracture is liable to occur.

_diagnosis and x-ray appearances of myeloma._--the early diagnosis of
myeloma is made with the aid of the x-rays: the typical appearance is
that of a rounded or oval clear area bounded by a shell of bone of
diminishing thickness (fig. 145). the inflammatory lesions at the ends
of the long bones--tubercle, syphilitic gumma, and brodie's abscess,
that resemble myeloma, are all attended with the formation of new bone
in greater or lesser amount. the myeloma is also to be diagnosed from
chondroma, from sarcoma, and from osteomyelitis fibrosa cystica.

[illustration: fig. 145.--radiogram of myeloma of humerus.

(mr. j. w. struthers' case.)]

_treatment._--in early cases the cortex is opened up to give free access
to the tumour tissue, which is scraped out with the spoon. bloodgood
advises the use of esmarch's tourniquet, and that the curetting be
followed by painting with pure carbolic acid and then rinsing with
alcohol; a rod of bone is inserted to fill the gap. in advanced cases
the segment of bone is resected and a portion of the tibia or fibula
from the other limb inserted into the gap; a tube of radium should also
be introduced.

the coexistence of diffuse myelomatosis of the skeleton and albumosuria
(bence-jones) is referred to on p. 474. myeloma occurs in the jaws,
taking origin in the marrow or from the periosteum of the alveolar
process, and is described elsewhere.

#sarcoma# and #endothelioma# are the commonest tumours of bone, and
present wide variations in structure and in clinical features.
structurally, two main groups may be differentiated: (1) the soft,
rapidly growing cellular tumours, and (2) those containing fully formed
fibrous tissue, cartilage, or bone.

(1) the _soft cellular tumours_ are composed mainly of spindle or round
cells; they grow from the marrow of the spongy ends or from the
periosteum of the long bones, the diploe of the skull, the pelvis,
vertebrae, and jaws. as they grow they may cause little alteration in the
contour of the bone, but they eat away its framework and replace it, so
that the continuity of the bone is maintained only by tumour tissue, and
pathological fracture is a frequent result. the small round-celled
sarcomas are among the most malignant tumours of bone, growing with
great rapidity, and at an early stage giving rise to secondary growths.

(2) the second group includes the _fibro-_, _osteo-_, and
_chondro-sarcomas_, and combinations of these; in all of them fully
formed tissues or attempts at fully formed tissues predominate over the
cellular elements. they grow chiefly from the deeper layer of the
periosteum, and at first form a projection on the surface, but later
tend to surround the bone (fig. 150), and to invade its interior,
filling up the marrow spaces with a white, bone-like substance; in the
flat bones of the skull they may traverse the diploe and erupt on the
inner table. the tumour tissue next the shaft consists of a dense,
white, homogeneous material, from which there radiate into the softer
parts of the tumour, spicules, needles, and plates, often exhibiting a
fan-like arrangement (fig. 151). the peripheral portion consists of soft
sarcomatous tissue, which invades the overlying soft parts. the
articular cartilage long resists destruction. the ossifying sarcoma is
met with most often in the femur and tibia, less frequently in the
humerus, skull, pelvis, and jaws. in the long bones it may grow from the
shaft, while the chondro-sarcoma more often originates at the
extremities. sometimes they are multiple, several tumours appearing
simultaneously or one after another. secondary growths are met with
chiefly in the lungs, metastasis taking place by way of the veins.

[illustration: fig. 146.--periosteal sarcoma of femur in a young
subject.]

[illustration: fig. 147.--periosteal sarcoma of humerus, after
maceration.

(anatomical museum, university of edinburgh.)]

_clinical features._--sarcoma is usually met with before the age of
thirty, and is comparatively common in children. males suffer oftener
than females, in the proportion of two to one.

in _periosteal sarcoma_ the presence of a swelling is usually the first
symptom; the tumour is fusiform, firm, and regular in outline, and when
it occurs near the end of a long bone the limb frequently assumes a
characteristic "leg of mutton" shape (fig. 146). the surface may be
uniform or bossed, the consistence varies at different parts, and the
swelling gradually tapers off along the shaft. on firm pressure, fine
crepitation may be felt from crushing of the delicate framework of new
bone.

[illustration: fig. 148.--chondro-sarcoma of scapula in a man aet. 63;
removal of the scapula was followed two years later by metastases and
death.]

in _central sarcoma_ pain is the first symptom, and it is usually
constant, dull, and aching; is not obviously increased by use of the
limb, but is often worse at night. swelling occurs late, and is due to
expansion of the bone; it is fusiform or globular, and is at first
densely hard, but in time there may be parchment-like or egg-shell
crackling from yielding of the thin shell. the swelling may pulsate, and
a bruit may be heard over it. in advanced cases it may be impossible to
differentiate between a periosteal and a central tumour, either
clinically or after the specimen has been laid open.

pathological fracture is more common in central tumours, and sometimes
is the first sign that calls attention to the condition. consolidation
rarely takes place, although there is often an attempt at union by the
formation of cartilaginous callus.

[illustration: fig. 149.--central sarcoma of lower end of femur,
invading the knee-joint.

(museum of royal college of surgeons, edinburgh.)]

[illustration: fig. 150.--osseous shell of osteo-sarcoma of upper third
of femur, after maceration.]

the soft parts over the tumour for a long time preserve their normal
appearance; or they become oedematous, and the subcutaneous venous
network is evident through the skin. elevation of the temperature over
the tumour, which may amount to two degrees or more, is a point of
diagnostic significance, as it suggests an inflammatory lesion.

the adjacent joint usually remains intact, although its movements may be
impaired by the bulk of the tumour or by effusion into the cavity.

enlargement of the neighbouring lymph glands does not necessarily imply
that they have become infected with sarcoma for the enlargement may
disappear after removal of the primary growth; actual infection of the
glands, however, does sometimes occur, and in them the histological
structure of the parent tumour is reproduced.

to obtain a reasonable prospect of cure, the _diagnosis_ must be made at
an early stage. great reliance is to be placed on information gained by
examination with the x-rays.

[illustration: fig. 151.--radiogram of osteo-sarcoma of upper third
of femur.]

_x-ray appearances._--in periosteal tumours that do not ossify, there is
merely erosion of bone, and the shadow is not unlike that given by
caries; in ossifying tumours, the arrangement of the new bone on the
surface is characteristic, and when it takes the form of spicules at
right angles to the shaft, it is pathognomic.

in soft central tumours, there is disappearance of bone shadow in the
area of the tumour, while above and below or around this, the shadow is
that of normal bone right up to the clear area. in many respects the
x-ray appearances resemble those of myeloma. in tumours in which there
is a considerable amount of imperfectly formed new bone, this gives a
shadow which barely replaces that of the original bone, in parts it may
even add to it--the resulting picture differing widely in different
cases; but it is usually possible to differentiate it from that caused
by bacterial infections of the bone and from lesions of the adjacent
joint.

[illustration: fig. 152.--radiogram of chondro-sarcoma of upper end of
humerus in a woman aet. 29.]

skiagraphy is not only of assistance in differentiating new growths from
other diseases of bone, but may also yield information as to the
situation and nature of the tumour, which may have important bearings on
its treatment by operation.

when fracture of a long bone takes place in an adolescent or young adult
from comparatively slight violence, disease of the bone should be
suspected and an x-ray examination made.

in difficult cases the final appeal is to exploratory incision and
microscopical examination of a portion of the tumour; this should be
done when the major operation has been arranged for, the surgeon waiting
until the examination is completed.

the _prognosis_ varies widely. in general, it may be said that
periosteal tumours are less favourable than central ones, because they
are more liable to give rise to metastases. permanent cures are
unfortunately the exception.

_treatment._--when one of the bones of a limb is involved, the usual
practice has been to perform amputation well above the growth, and this
may still be recommended as a routine procedure. there are reasons,
however, which may be urged against its continuance. high amputation is
unnecessary in the more benign sarcomas, and in the more malignant forms
is usually unavailing to prevent a fatal issue either from local
recurrence or from metastases in the lungs or elsewhere. following
the lead of mikulicz, a considerable number of permanent cures have been
obtained by resecting the portion of bone which is the seat of the
tumour, and substituting for it a corresponding portion from the tibia
or fibula of the other limb. in a cellular sarcoma of the humerus of a
boy we resected the shaft and inserted his fibula ten years ago, and he
shows no sign of recurrence. when resection is impracticable, a
subcapsular enucleation is performed, followed by the insertion of
radium.

#pulsating haematoma# or #aneurysm of bone#.--a limited number of these
are innocent cavernous tumours dating from a congenital angioma. the
majority would appear to be the result of changes in a sarcoma,
endothelioma, or myeloma. the tumour tissue largely disappears, while
the vessels and vascular spaces undergo a remarkable development. the
tumour may come to be represented by one large blood-containing space
communicating with the arteries of the limb; the walls of the space
consist of the remains of the original tumour, plus a shell of bone of
varying thickness. the most common seats of the condition are the lower
end of the femur, the upper end of the tibia, and the bones of the
pelvis.

the _clinical features_ are those of a pulsating tumour of slow
development, and as in true aneurysm, the pulsation and bruit disappear
on compression of the main artery. the origin of the tumour from bone
may be revealed by the presence of egg-shell crackling, and by
examination with the x-rays.

if the condition is believed to be innocent, the treatment is the same
as for aneurysm--preferably by ligation of the main artery; if
malignant, it is the same as for sarcoma.

#secondary tumours of bone.#--these embrace two groups of new growth,
those which give rise to secondary growths in the marrow of bones and
those which spread to bone by direct continuity.

_metastatic tumours._--excepting certain cancers which give rise to
metastases by lymphatic permeation (handley), the common metastases
arising in the bone-marrow reach their destination through the
blood-stream.

[illustration: fig. 153.--epitheliomatous ulcer of leg with direct
extension to tibia.

(lord lister's specimen. anatomical museum, university of edinburgh.)]

secondary cancer is a comparatively common disease, and, as in
metastases in other tissues, the secondary growths resemble the parent
tumour. the soft forms grow rapidly, and eat away the bone, without
altering its shape or form. in slowly growing forms there may be
considerable formation of imperfectly formed bone, often deficient in
lime salts; this condition may be widely diffused throughout the
skeleton, and, as it is associated with softening and bending of the
bones, it is known as _cancerous osteomalacia_. secondary cancer of bone
is attended with pain, or it suddenly attracts notice by the occurrence
of pathological fracture--as, for example, in the shaft of the femur or
humerus. in the vertebrae, it is attended with a painful form of
paraplegia, which may involve the lower or all four extremities. on the
other hand, the disease may show itself clinically as a tumour of bone,
which may attain a considerable size, and may be mistaken for a sarcoma,
unless the existence of the primary cancer is discovered.

the cancers most liable to give rise to metastasis in bone are those of
the breast, liver, uterus, prostate, colon, and rectum; hyper-nephroma
of the kidney may also give rise to metastases in bone.

_secondary tumours derived from the thyreoid gland_ require special
mention, because they are peculiar in that neither the primary growth in
the thyreoid nor the secondary growth in the bones is necessarily
malignant. they are therefore amenable to operative treatment.

_secondary sarcoma_, whether derived from a primary growth in the bone
or in the soft parts, is much rarer than secondary cancer. its removal
by operation is usually contra-indicated, but we have known of cases
terminating fatally in which the _section_ revealed only one metastasis,
the removal of which would have benefited the patient.

in all of these conditions, examination of the bones with the x-rays
gives valuable information and often disclose unsuspected metastases.

_cancer of bone resulting from direct extension from soft parts._--in
this group there are also two clinical types. the first is met with in
relation to _epithelioma of a mucous surface_--for example, the palate,
tongue, gums, antrum, frontal sinus, auditory meatus, or middle ear.
they will be described under these special regions.

the second type is met with in relation to _epithelioma occurring in a
sinus_, the sequel of suppurative osteomyelitis, compound fracture, or
tuberculous disease. the patient has usually had a discharging sinus for
a great number of years: we have known it to last as many as fifty. the
epithelioma originates at the skin orifice of the sinus, and spreads to
the bone and into its interior, where the progress of the cancer is
resisted by dense bone, which obliterates the medullary canal. although
its progress is slow, the infiltration of the bone is usually more
extensive than appears externally. it is recognised clinically by the
characteristic cauliflower growth at the orifice of the sinus, and by
the offensive nature of the discharge. a similar epithelioma may arise
in connection with a _chronic ulcer of the leg_. the cancer may infect
the femoral lymph glands. the operative treatment is influenced by the
extent of the disease in the soft parts overlying the bone, and consists
in wide removal of the diseased tissues and resection of the bone, or in
amputation.

#cysts of bone.#--with the exception of hydatid cysts, cysts in the
interior of bone are the result of the liquefaction of solid tissue;
this may be that of chondroma, myeloma, or sarcoma, but more commonly of
the marrow in osteomyelitis fibrosa.




chapter xxi

diseases of joints


definition of terms--ankylosis. diseases: errors of
    development--bacterial diseases: _pyogenic_; _gonorrhoeal_;
    _tuberculous_; _syphilitic_; _acute rheumatism_--diseases
    associated with certain constitutional conditions: _gout_; _chronic
    articular rheumatism_; _arthritis deformans_;
    _haemophilia_--diseases associated with affections of the nervous
    system: _neuro-arthropathies_; _charcot's disease_--hysterical or
    mimetic affections of joints--tumours and cysts--loose bodies.

#definition of terms.#--the term _synovitis_ is applied to any reaction
which affects the synovial membrane of a joint. it is usually associated
with effusion of fluid, and this may be serous, sero-fibrinous, or
purulent. as the term synovitis merely refers to the tissue involved, it
should always be used with an adjective--such as gouty, gonorrhoeal, or
tuberculous--which indicates its pathological nature.

the terms _hydrops_, _hydrarthrosis_, and _chronic serous synovitis_ are
synonymous, and are employed when a serous effusion into the joint is
the prominent clinical feature. hydrops may occur apart from
disease--for example, in the knee-joint from repeated sprains, or when
there is a loose body in the joint--but is met with chiefly in the
chronic forms of synovitis which result from gonorrhoea, tuberculosis,
syphilis, arthritis deformans, or arthropathies of nerve origin.

_arthritis_ is the term applied when not only the synovial membrane but
the articular surfaces, and it may be also the ends of the bones, are
involved, and it is necessary to prefix a qualifying adjective which
indicates its nature. when effusion is present, it may be serous, as in
arthritis deformans, or sero-fibrinous or purulent, as in certain forms
of pyogenic and tuberculous arthritis. wasting of the muscles,
especially the extensors, in the vicinity of the joint is a constant
accompaniment of arthritis. on account of the involvement of the
articular surfaces, arthritis is apt to be followed by ankylosis.

the term _empyema_ is sometimes employed to indicate that the cavity of
the joint contains pus. this is observed chiefly in chronic disease of
pyogenic or tuberculous origin, and is usually attended with the
formation of abscesses outside the joint.

_ulceration of cartilage_ and _caries of the articular surfaces_ are
common accompaniments of the more serious and progressive forms of joint
disease, especially those of bacterial origin. the destruction of
cartilage may be secondary to disease of the synovial membrane or of the
subjacent bone. when the disease begins as a synovitis, the synovial
membrane spreads over the articular surface, fuses with the cartilage
and eats into it, causing defects or holes which are spoken of as
ulcers. when the disease begins in the bone, the marrow is converted
into granulation tissue, which eats into the cartilage and separates it
from the bone. following on the destruction of the cartilage, the
articular surface of the bone undergoes disintegration, a condition
spoken of as _caries of the articular surface_. the occurrence of
ulceration of cartilage and of articular caries is attended with the
clinical signs of fixation of the joint from involuntary muscular
contraction, wasting of muscles, and starting pains. these _starting
pains_ are the result of sudden involuntary movements of the joint. they
occur most frequently as the patient is dropping off to sleep; the
muscles becoming relaxed, the sensitive ulcerated surfaces jar on one
another, which causes sudden reflex contraction of the muscles, and the
resulting movement being attended with severe pain, wakens the patient
with a start. advanced articular caries is usually associated with some
abnormal attitude and with shortening of the limb. it may be possible to
feel the bony surfaces grate upon one another. when all its constituent
elements are damaged or destroyed, a joint is said to be _disorganised_.
should recovery take place, repair is usually attended with union of the
opposing articular surfaces either by fibrous tissue or by bone.

#conditions of impaired mobility of joints.#--there are four conditions
of impaired mobility in joints: rigidity, contracture, ankylosis, and
locking. _rigidity_ is the fixation of a joint by involuntary
contraction of muscles, and is of value as a sign of disease in
deep-seated joints, such as the hip. it disappears under anaesthesia.

_contracture_ is the term applied when the fixation is due to permanent
shortening of the soft parts around a joint--muscles, tendons,
ligaments, fasciae, or skin. as the structures on the flexor aspect are
more liable to undergo such shortening, contracture is nearly always
associated with flexion. contracture may result from disease of the
joint, or from conditions outside it--for example, disease in one of
the adjacent bones, or lesions of the nerves.

_ankylosis_ is the term applied when impaired mobility results from
changes involving the articular surfaces. it is frequently combined with
contracture. three anatomical varieties of ankylosis are
recognised--(a) the _fibrous_, in which there are adhesions between
the opposing surfaces, which may be in the form of loose isolated bands
of fibrous tissue, or may bind the bones so closely together as to
obliterate the cavity of the joint. the resulting stiffness, therefore,
varies from a mere restriction of the normal range of movement, up to a
close union of the bones which prevents movement. fibrous ankylosis may
follow upon injury, especially dislocation or fracture implicating a
joint, or it may result from any form of arthritis. (b) _cartilaginous
ankylosis_ implies the fusion of two apposed cartilaginous surfaces. it
is often found between the patella and the trochlear surface of the
femur in tuberculous disease of the knee. the fusion of the
cartilaginous surfaces is preceded by the spreading of a vascular
connective tissue, derived from the synovial membrane, over the
articular cartilage. clinically, it is associated with absolute
immobility, (c) _bony ankylosis_ or _synostosis_ is an osseous union
between articulating surfaces (figs. 154 and 155). it may follow upon
fibrous or cartilaginous ankylosis, or may result from the fusion of two
articular surfaces which have lost their cartilage and become covered
with granulations. in the majority of cases it is to be regarded as a
reparative process, presenting analogies with the union of fracture.

[illustration: fig. 154.--osseous ankylosis of femur and tibia in
position of flexion.]

the term _arthritis ossificans_ has been applied by joseph griffiths to
a condition in which the articular surfaces become fused without evident
cause.

the occurrence of ankylosis in a joint before the skeleton has attained
maturity does not appear to impair the growth in length of the bones
affected; ankylosis of the temporo-maxillary joints, however, greatly
impairs the growth of the mandible. when there is arrest of growth
accompanying ankylosis, it usually depends on changes in the ossifying
junctions caused by the original disease.

to differentiate by manipulation between muscular fixation and
ankylosis, it may be necessary to anaesthetise the patient. the nature
and extent of ankylosis may be learned by skiagraphy; in osseous
ankylosis the shadow of the two bones is a continuous one. in fibrous as
contrasted with osseous ankylosis mobility may be elicited, although
only to a limited extent; while in osseous ankylosis the joint is
rigidly fixed, and attempts to move it are painless.

[illustration: fig. 155.--osseous ankylosis of knee in the flexed
position following upon tuberculous arthritis.

(anatomical museum, university of edinburgh.)]

the _treatment_ is influenced by the nature of the original lesion, the
variety of the ankylosis, and the attitude of the joint. when there is
restriction of movement due to fibrous adhesions, these may be elongated
or ruptured. elongation of the adhesions may be effected by
manipulations, exercises, and the use of special forms of
apparatus--such as the application of weights to the limb. it may be
necessary to administer an anaesthetic before rupturing strong fibrous
adhesions, and this procedure must be carried out with caution, in view
of such risks as fracture of the bone--which is often rarefied--or
separation of an epiphysis. there is also the risk of fat embolism, and
of re-starting the original disease. the giving way of adhesions may be
attended with an audible crack; and the procedure is often followed by
considerable pain and effusion into the joint, which necessitate rest
for some days before exercises and manipulations can be resumed.

_operative treatment_ may be called for in cases in which the bones are
closely bound to one another by fibrous or by osseous tissue.

_arthrolysis_, which consists in opening the joint and dividing the
fibrous adhesions, is almost inevitably followed by their reunion.

_arthroplasty._--murphy of chicago devised this operation for restoring
movement to an ankylosed joint. it consists in transplanting between the
bones a flap of fat-bearing tissue, from which a bursal cavity lined
with endothelium and containing a fluid rich in mucin is ultimately
formed.

arthroplasty is most successful in ankylosis following upon injury; when
the ankylosis results from some infective condition such as tuberculosis
or gonorrhoea, it is liable to result in failure either because of a
fresh outbreak of the infection or because the ankylosis recurs.

when arthroplasty is impracticable, and a movable joint is desired--for
example at the elbow--a considerable amount of bone, and it may be also
of periosteum and capsular ligament, is resected to allow of the
formation of a false joint.

when bony ankylosis has occurred with the joint in an undesirable
attitude--for example flexion at the hip or knee--it can sometimes be
remedied by osteotomy or by a wedge-shaped resection of the bone, with
or without such additional division of the contracted soft parts as will
permit of the limb being placed in the attitude desired.

bony ankylosis of the joints of a finger, whether the result of injury
or disease, is difficult to remedy by any operative procedure, for while
it is possible to restore mobility, the new joint is apt to be
flail-like.

_locking._--a joint is said to lock when its movements are abruptly
arrested by the coming together of bony outgrowths around the joint. it
is best illustrated in arthritis deformans of the hip in which new bone
formed round the rim of the acetabulum mechanically arrests the
excursions of the head of the femur. the new bone, which limits the
movements, is readily demonstrated in skiagrams; it may be removed by
operative means. locking of joints is more often met with as a result of
injuries, especially in fractures occurring in the region of the elbow.
in certain injuries of the semilunar menisci of the knee, also, the
joint is liable to a variety of locking, which differs, however, in many
respects from that described above.

#errors of development.#--these include congenital dislocations and
other deformities of intra-uterine origin, such as abnormal laxity of
joints, absence, displacement, or defective growth of one or other of
the essential constituents of a joint. the more important of these are
described along with the surgery of the extremities.


diseases of joints

#bacterial diseases.#--in most bacterial diseases the organisms are
carried to the joint in the blood-stream, and they lodge either in the
synovial membrane or in one of the bones, whence the disease
subsequently spreads to the other structures of the joint. organisms may
also be introduced through accidental wounds. it has been shown
experimentally that joints are among the most susceptible parts of the
body to infection, and this would appear to be due to the viscid
character of the synovial fluid, which protects organisms from
bactericidal agents in the tissues and fluids.


pyogenic diseases

the commoner pyogenic diseases are the result of infection of one or
other of the joint structures with _staphylococci_ or _streptococci_,
which may be demonstrated in the exudate in the joint and in the
substance of the synovial membrane. the mode of infection is the same as
in the pyogenic diseases of bone, the metastasis occurring most
frequently from the mucous membrane of the pharynx (j. b. murphy). the
localisation of the infection in a particular joint is determined by
injury, exposure to cold, antecedent disease of the joint, or other
factors, the nature of which is not always apparent.

the effects on the joint vary in severity. in the milder forms, there is
engorgement and infiltration of the synovial membrane, and an effusion
into the cavity of the joint of serous fluid mixed with flakes of
fibrin--_serous synovitis_. in more severe infections the exudate
consists of pus mixed with fibrin, and, it may be, red blood
corpuscles--_purulent_ or _suppurative synovitis_; the synovial membrane
and the ligaments are softened, and the surface of the membrane presents
granulations resembling those on an ulcer; foci of suppuration may
develop in the peri-articular cellular tissue and result in abscesses.
in _acute arthritis_, all the structures of the joint are involved; the
articular cartilage is invaded by granulation tissue derived from the
synovial membrane, and from the marrow of the subjacent bone; it
presents a worm-eaten or ulcerated appearance, or it may undergo
necrosis and separate, exposing the subjacent bone and leading to
disintegration of the osseous trabeculae--_caries_. with the destruction
of the ligaments, the stability of the joint is lost, and it becomes
disorganised.

the _clinical features_ vary with the extent of the infection. when
this is confined to the synovial and peri-synovial tissues--_acute
serous_ and _purulent synovitis_--there is the usual general reaction,
associated with pyrexia and great pain in the joint. the part is hot and
swollen, the swelling assuming the shape of the distended synovial sac,
fluctuation can usually be elicited, and the joint is held in the flexed
position.

when the joint is infected by extension from the surrounding cellular
tissue, the joint lesion may not be recognised at an early stage because
of the swollen condition of the limb, and because there are already
symptoms of toxaemia. we have observed a case in which both the hip and
knee joints were infected from the cellular tissue.

if the infection involves all the joint structures--_acute
arthritis_--the general and local phenomena are intensified, the
temperature rises quickly, often with a rigor, and remains high; the
patient looks ill, and is either unable to sleep or the sleep is
disturbed by starting pains. the joint is held rigid in the flexed
position, and the least attempt at movement causes severe pain; the
slightest jar--even the shaking of the bed--may cause agony. the joint
is hot, tensely distended, and there may be oedema of the peri-articular
tissues or of the limb as a whole. if the pus perforates the joint
capsule, there are signs of abscess or of diffuse suppuration in the
cellular tissue. the final disorganisation of the joint is indicated by
abnormal mobility and grating of the articular surfaces, or by
spontaneous displacement of the bones, and this may amount to
dislocation. in the acute arthritis of infants, the epiphysis concerned
may be separated and displaced.

when the _joint is infected through an external wound_, the anatomical
features are similar to those observed when the infection has reached
the joint by the blood-stream, but the destructive changes tend to be
more severe and are more likely to result in disorganisation.

the _terminations_ vary with the gravity of the infection and with the
stage at which treatment is instituted. in the milder forms recovery is
the rule, with more or less complete restoration of function. in more
severe forms the joint may be permanently damaged as a result of fibrous
or bony ankylosis, or from displacement or dislocation. from changes in
the peri-articular structures there may be contracture in an undesirable
position, and in young subjects the growth of the limb may be interfered
with. the persistence of sinuses is usually due to disease in one or
other of the adjacent bones. in the most severe forms, and especially
when several joints are involved, death may result from toxaemia.

the _treatment_ is carried out on the same principles as in other
pyogenic infections. the limb is immobilised in such an attitude that
should stiffness occur there will be the least interference with
function. extension by weight and pulley is the most valuable means of
allaying muscular spasm and relieving intra-articular tension and of
counteracting the tendency to flexion; as much as 15 or 20 pounds may be
required to relieve the pain.

the induction of hyperaemia is sometimes remarkably efficacious in
relieving pain and in arresting the progress of the infection. if the
fluid in the joint is in sufficient quantity to cause tension, if it
persists, or if there is reason to suspect that it is purulent, it
should be withdrawn without delay; an exploring syringe usually
suffices, the skin being punctured with a tenotomy knife, and, as
practised by murphy, 5 to 15 c.c. of a 2 per cent. solution of formalin
in glycerin are injected and the wound is closed. in virulent infections
the injection may be repeated in twenty-four hours. drainage by tube or
otherwise is to be condemned (murphy). a vaccine may be prepared from
the fluid in the joint and injected into the subcutaneous cellular
tissue.

suppuration in the peri-articular soft parts or in one of the adjacent
bones must be looked for and dealt with.

when convalescence is established, attention is directed to the
restoration of the functions of the limb, and to the prevention of
stiffness and deformity by movements and massage, and the use of hot-air
and other baths.

at a later stage, and especially in neglected cases, operative and other
measures may be required for deformity or ankylosis.


#metastatic forms of pyogenic infection#

in #pyaemia#, one or more joints may fill with pus without marked
symptoms or signs, and if the pus is aspirated without delay the joint
often recovers without impairment of function.

in #typhoid fever#, joint lesions result from infection with the typhoid
bacillus alone or along with pyogenic organisms, and run their course
with or without suppuration; there is again a remarkable absence of
symptoms, and attention may only be called to the condition by the
occurrence of dislocation.

joint lesions are comparatively common in #scarlet fever#, and were
formerly described as scarlatinal rheumatism. the most frequent clinical
type is that of a serous synovitis, occurring within a week or ten days
from the onset of the fever. its favourite seat is in the hand and
wrist, the sheaths of the extensor tendons as well as the synovial
membrane of the joints being involved. it does not tend to migrate to
other joints, and rarely lasts longer than a few days. it is probably
due to the specific virus of scarlet fever.

at a later stage, especially in children and in cases in which the
throat lesion is severe, an arthritis is sometimes observed that is
believed to be a metastasis from the throat; it may be acute and
suppurative, affect several joints, and exhibit a septicaemic or pyaemic
character.

the joints of the lower extremity are especially apt to suffer; the
child is seriously ill, is delirious at night, develops bed-sores over
the sacrum and, it may happen that, not being expected to recover, the
legs are allowed to assume contracture deformities with ankylosis or
dislocation at the hip and flexion ankylosis at the knees; should the
child survive, the degree of crippling may be pitiable in the extreme;
prolonged orthopaedic treatment and a series of operations--arthroplasty,
osteotomies, and resections--may be required to restore even a limited
capacity of locomotion.

#pneumococcal affections of joints#, the result of infection with the
pneumococcus of fraenkel, are being met with in increasing numbers. the
local lesion varies from a _synovitis_ with infiltration of the synovial
membrane and effusion of serum or pus, to an _acute arthritis_ with
erosion of cartilage, caries of the articular surfaces, and
disorganisation of the joint. the knee is most frequently affected, but
several joints may suffer at the same time. in most cases the joint
affection makes its appearance a few days after the commencement of a
pneumonia, but in a number of instances, especially among children, the
lung is not specially involved, and the condition is an indication of a
generalised pneumococcal infection, which may manifest itself by
endocarditis, empyema, meningitis, or peritonitis, and frequently has a
fatal termination. the differential diagnosis from other forms of
pyogenic infection is established by bacteriological examination of the
fluid withdrawn from the joint. the treatment is carried out on the same
lines as in other pyogenic infections, considerable reliance being
placed on the use of autogenous vaccines.

in #measles#, #diphtheria#, #smallpox#, #influenza#, and #dysentery#,
similar joint lesions may occur.

the joint lesions which accompany #acute rheumatism# or "rheumatic
fever" are believed to be due to a diplococcus. in the course of a
general illness in which there is moderate pyrexia and profuse sweating,
some of the larger joints, and not infrequently the smaller ones also,
become swollen and extremely sensitive, so that the sufferer lies in bed
helpless, dreading the slightest movement. from day to day fresh joints
are attacked, while those first affected subside, often with great
rapidity. affections of the heart-valves and of the pericardium are
commonly present. on recovery from the acute illness, it may be found
that the joints have entirely recovered, but in a small proportion of
cases certain of them remain stiff and pass into the crippled condition
described under chronic rheumatism. there is no call for operative
interference.

#gonococcal affections of joints.#--these include all forms of joint
lesion occurring in association with gonorrhoeal urethritis,
vulvo-vaginitis, or gonorrhoeal ophthalmia. they may develop at any stage
of the urethritis, but are most frequently met with from the eighteenth
to the twenty-second day after the primary infection, when the organisms
have reached the posterior urethra; they have been observed, however,
after the discharge has ceased. there is no connection between the
severity of the gonorrhoea and the incidence of joint disease. in women,
the gonorrhoeal nature of the discharge must be established by
bacteriological examination.

as a complication of ophthalmia, the joint lesions are met with in
infants, and occur more commonly towards the end of the second or during
the third week.

the gonococcus is carried to the joint in the blood-stream and is first
deposited in the synovial membrane, in the tissues of which it can
usually be found; it may be impossible to find it in the exudate within
the joint. the joint lesions may be the only evidence of metastasis, or
they may be part of a general infection involving the endocardium,
pleura, and tendon sheaths.

the joints most frequently affected are the knee, elbow, ankle, wrist,
and fingers. usually two or more joints are affected.

several clinical types are differentiated. (1) a _dry poly-arthritis_
met with in the joints and tendon sheaths of the wrist and hand,
formerly described as gonorrhoeal rheumatism, which in some cases is
trifling and evanescent, and in others is persistent and progressive,
and results in stiffness of the affected joints and permanent crippling
of the hand and fingers.

(2) the commonest type is a _chronic synovitis_ or _hydrops_, in which
the joint--very often the knee--becomes filled with a serous or
sero-fibrinous exudate. there are no reactive changes in the synovial
membrane, cellular tissue, or skin, nor is there any fever or
disturbance of health. the movements are free except in so far as they
are restricted by the amount of fluid in the joint. it usually subsides
in two or three weeks under rest, but tends to relapse.

(3) an _acute synovitis_ with peri-articular phlegmon is most often met
with in the elbow, but it occurs also in the knee and ankle. there is a
sudden onset of severe pain and swelling in and around the joint, with
considerable fever and disturbance of health. the slightest movement
causes pain, and the part is sensitive to touch. the skin is hot and
tense, and in the case of the elbow may be red and fiery as in
erysipelas.

the deposit of fibrin on the synovial membrane and on the articular
surfaces may lead to the formation of adhesions, sometimes in the form
of isolated bands, sometimes in the form of a close fibrous union
between the bones.

(4) a _suppurative arthritis_, like that caused by ordinary pus
microbes, may be the result of gonococcal infection alone or of a mixed
infection. usually only one joint is affected, but the condition may be
multiple. the articular cartilages are destroyed, the ends of the bones
are covered with granulations, extra-articular abscesses form, and
complete osseous ankylosis results.

the _diagnosis_ is often missed because the possibility of gonorrhoea is
not suspected.

the denial of the disease by the patient is not always to be relied
upon, especially in the case of women, as they may be ignorant of its
presence. the chief points in the differential diagnosis from acute
articular rheumatism are, that the gonorrhoeal affection is more often
confined to one or two joints, has little tendency to wander from joint
to joint, and its progress is not appreciably influenced by salicylates,
although these drugs may relieve pain. the conclusive point is the
recognition of a gonorrhoeal discharge or of threads in the urine.

the disease may persist or may relapse, and the patient may be laid up
for weeks or months, and may finally be crippled in one or in several
joints.

the _treatment_--besides that of the urethral disease or of the
ophthalmia--consists in rest until all pain and sensitiveness have
disappeared. the pain is relieved by salicylates, but most benefit
follows weight extension, the induction of hyperaemia by the rubber
bandage and hot-air baths; if the joint is greatly distended, the fluid
may be withdrawn by a needle and syringe. detoxicated vaccines should be
given from the first, and in afebrile cases the injection of a foreign
protein, such as anti-typhoid vaccine, is beneficial (harrison).

murphy has found benefit from the introduction into the joint, in the
early stages, of from 5 to 15 c.c. of a 2 per cent. solution of formalin
in glycerin. this may be repeated within a week, the patient being kept
in bed with light weight extension. in the chronic hydrops the fluid is
withdrawn, and about an ounce of a 1 per cent. solution of protargol
injected; the patient should be warned of the marked reaction which
follows.

after all symptoms have settled down, but not till then, for fear of
exciting relapse or metastasis, the joint is massaged and exercised.
stiffness from adhesions is most intractable, and may, in spite of every
attention, terminate in ankylosis even in cases where there has been no
suppuration. forcible breaking down of adhesions under anaesthesia is
not recommended, as it is followed by great suffering and the adhesions
re-form. operation for ankylosis--arthroplasty--should not be
undertaken, as the ankylosis recurs.


tuberculous disease

tuberculous disease of joints results from bacillary infection through
the arteries. the disease may commence in the synovial membrane or in
the marrow of one of the adjacent bones, and the relative frequency of
these two seats of infection has been the subject of considerable
difference of opinion. the traditional view of konig is that in the knee
and most of the larger joints the disease arises in the bone and in the
synovial membrane in about equal proportion, and that in the hip the
number of cases beginning in the bones is about five times greater than
that originating in the membrane. this estimate, so far as the actual
frequency of bone lesions is concerned, has been generally accepted, but
recent observers, notably john fraser, do not accept the presence of
bone lesions as necessarily proving that the disease commenced in the
bones; he maintains, and we think with good grounds, that in many cases
the disease having commenced in the synovial membrane, slowly spreads to
the bone by way of the blood vessels and lymphatics, and gives rise to
lesions in the marrow.

#morbid anatomy.#--tuberculous disease in the articular end of a long
bone may give rise to _reactive changes_ in the adjacent joint,
characterised by effusion and by the extension of the synovial membrane
over the articular surfaces. this may result in the formation of
adhesions which obliterate the cavity of the joint or divide it into
compartments. these lesions are comparatively common, and are not
necessarily due to actual tuberculous infection of the joint.

the _infection of the joint_ by tubercle originating in the adjacent
bone may take place at the periphery, the osseous focus reaching the
surface of the bone at the site of reflection of the synovial membrane,
and the infection which begins at this point then spreads to the rest of
the membrane. or it may take place in the central area, by the
projection of tuberculous granulation tissue into the joint following
upon erosion of the cartilage (fig. 156).

[illustration: fig. 156.--section of upper end of fibula, showing
caseating focus in marrow, erupting on articular surface and infecting
joint.]

_changes in the synovial membrane._--in the majority of cases there is a
_diffuse thickening of the synovial membrane_, due to the formation of
granulation tissue, or of young connective tissue, in its substance.
this new tissue is arranged in two layers--the outer composed of fully
formed connective or fibrous tissue, the inner of embryonic tissue,
usually permeated with miliary tubercles. on opening the joint, these
tubercles may be seen on the surface of the membrane, or the surface may
be covered with a layer of fibrinous or caseating tissue. where there is
greater resistance on the part of the tissues, there is active formation
of young connective tissue which circumscribes or encapsulates the
tubercles, so that they remain embedded in the substance of the
membrane, and are only seen on cutting into it.

the thickened synovial membrane is projected into the cavity of the
joint, filling up its pouches and recesses, and spreading over the
surface of the articular cartilage "like ivy growing on a wall."
wherever the synovial tissue covers the cartilage it becomes adherent to
and fused with it. the morbid process may be arrested at this stage, and
fibrous adhesions form between the opposing articular surfaces, or it
may progress, in which case further changes occur, resulting in
destruction of the articular cartilage and exposure of the subjacent
bone.

in rare instances the synovial membrane presents nodular masses or
lumps, resembling the tuberculous tumours met with in the brain; they
project into the cavity of the joint, are often pedunculated, and may
give rise to the symptoms of loose body. the fringes of synovial
membrane may also undergo a remarkable development, like that observed
in arthritis deformans, and described as arborescent lipoma. both these
types are almost exclusively met with in the knee.

_the contents of tuberculous joints._--in a large proportion of cases of
synovial tuberculosis the joint is entirely filled up by the diffuse
thickening of the synovial membrane. in a small number there is an
abundant serous exudate, and with this there may be a considerable
formation of fibrin, covering the surface of the membrane and floating
in the fluid as flakes or masses; under the influence of movement it may
assume the shape of melon-seed bodies. more rarely the joint contains
pus, and the surface of the synovial membrane resembles the wall of a
cold abscess.

_ulceration and necrosis of cartilage._--the synovial tissue covering
the cartilage causes pitting and perforation of the cartilage and makes
its way through it, and often spreads widely between it and the
subjacent bone; the cartilage may be detached in portions of
considerable size. it may be similarly ulcerated or detached as a result
of disease in the bone.

_caries of articular surfaces._--tuberculous infiltration of the marrow
in the surface cancelli breaks up the spongy framework of the bone into
minute irregular fragments, so that it disintegrates or crumbles
away--caries. when there is an absence of caseation and suppuration, the
condition is called _caries sicca_.

the pressure of the articular surfaces against one another favours the
progress of ulceration of cartilage and of articular caries. these
processes are usually more advanced in the areas most exposed to
pressure--for example, in the hip-joint, on the superior aspect of the
head of the femur, and on the posterior and upper segment of the
acetabulum.

the occurrence of _pathological dislocation_ is due to softening and
stretching of the ligaments which normally retain the bones in position,
and to some factor causing displacement, which may be the accumulation
of fluid or of granulations in the joint, the involuntary contraction of
muscles, or some movement or twist of the limb. the occurrence of
dislocation is also favoured by destructive changes in the bones.

_peri-articular tubercle and abscess_ may result from the spread of
disease from the bone or joint into the surrounding tissues, either
directly or by way of the lymphatics. a peri-articular abscess may
spread in several directions, sometimes invading tendon sheaths or
bursae, and finally reaching the skin surface by tortuous sinuses.

reactive changes in the vicinity of tuberculous joints are of common
occurrence, and play a considerable part in the production of what is
clinically known as _white swelling_. new connective tissue forms in the
peri-articular fat and between muscles and tendons. it may be tough and
fibrous, or soft, vascular, and oedematous, and the peri-articular fat
becomes swollen and gelatinous, constituting a layer of considerable
thickness. the fat disappears and is replaced by a mucoid effusion
between the fibrous bundles of connective tissue. this is what was
formerly known as _gelatinous degeneration_ of the synovial membrane. in
the case of the wrist the newly formed connective tissue may fix the
tendons in their sheaths, interfering with the movements of the fingers.
in relation to the bones also there may be reactive changes, resulting
in the formation of spicules of new bone on the periosteal surfaces and
at the attachment of the capsular and other ligaments; these are only
met with where pyogenic infection has been superadded.

_terminations and sequelae._--a natural process of cure may occur at any
stage, the tuberculous tissue being replaced by scar tissue. recovery is
apt to be attended with impairment of movement due to adhesions,
ankylosis, or contracture of the peri-articular structures. caseous foci
in the interior of the bones may become encapsulated, and a cure be thus
effected, or they may be the cause of a relapse of the disease at a
later date. interference with growth is comparatively common, and may
involve only the epiphysial junctions in the immediate vicinity of the
joint affected, or those of all the bones of the limb. this is well seen
in adults who have suffered from severe disease of the hip in
childhood--the entire limb, including the foot, being shorter and
smaller than the corresponding parts of the opposite side.

atrophic conditions are also met with, the bones undergoing fatty
atrophy, so that in extreme cases they may be cut with a knife or be
easily fractured. these atrophic conditions are most marked in bedridden
patients, and are largely due to disuse of the limb; they are recovered
from if it is able to resume its functions.

#clinical features.#--these vary with the different anatomical forms of
the disease, and with the joint affected.

sometimes the disease is ushered in by a febrile attack attended with
pains in several joints--described by john duncan as _tuberculous
arthritic fever_. this is liable to be mistaken for rheumatic fever,
from which, however, it differs in that there is no real migration from
joint to joint; there is an absence of sweating and of cardiac
complications; and no benefit follows the administration of salicylates.

in exceptional cases, tuberculous joint disease follows an acute course
resembling that of the pyogenic arthritis of infants. this has been
observed in children, especially in the knee, the lesion being in the
synovial membrane, and attended with an accumulation of pus in the
joint. if promptly treated by incision and drainage, recovery is rapid,
and free movement of the joint, may be preserved.

the onset and early stages of tuberculous disease, however, are more
often insidious, and are attended with so few symptoms that the disease
may have obtained a considerable hold before it attracts notice. it is
not uncommon for patients or their friends to attribute the condition to
injury, as it often first attracts attention after some slight trauma or
excessive use of the limb. the symptoms usually subside under rest, only
to relapse again with use of the limb.

the initial local symptoms may be due to the presence of a focus in the
neighbouring bone, perhaps causing neuralgic pains in the joint, or
weakness, tiredness, stiffness, and inability to use the limb, these
symptoms improving with rest and being aggravated by exertion.

it is rarely possible by external examination to recognise deep-seated
osseous foci in the vicinity of joints; but if they are near the surface
in a superficial bone--such as the head of the tibia--there may be local
thickening of the periosteum, oedema, pain, and tenderness on pressure
and on percussion.

_x-ray appearances of tuberculous joints._--gross lesions such as
caseous foci in the marrow of the adjacent bone show as clear areas with
an ill-defined margin; a sclerosed focus gives a denser shadow than the
surrounding bone, and a sequestrum presents a dark shadow of irregular
contour, and a clear interval between it and the surrounding bone.

caries of the articular surface imparts a woolly appearance or irregular
contour in place of the well-defined outline of the articular end of the
bone. in bony ankylosis the shadow of the two bones is a continuous one,
the joint interval having been filled up. the minor changes are best
appreciated on comparison with the normal joint of the other limb.

_wasting of muscles_ is a constant accompaniment of tuberculous joint
disease. it is to be attributed partly to want of use, but chiefly to
reflex interference with the trophic innervation of the muscles. it is
specially well seen in the extensor and adductor muscles of the thigh in
disease of the knee, and in the deltoid in disease of the shoulder. the
muscles become soft and flaccid, they exhibit tremors on attempted
movement, and their excitability to the faradic current is diminished.
the muscular tissue may be largely replaced by fat.

_impairment of the normal movements_ is one of the most valuable
diagnostic signs, particularly in deeply seated joints such as the
shoulder, hip, and spine. it is due to a protective contraction of the
muscles around the joint, designed to prevent movement. this muscular
fixation disappears under anaesthesia.

_abnormal attitudes of the limb_ occur earlier, and are more pronounced
in cases in which pain and other irritative symptoms of articular
disease are well marked, and are best illustrated by the attitudes
assumed in disease of the hip. they are due to reflex or involuntary
contraction of the muscles acting on the joint, with the object of
placing it in the attitude of greatest ease; they also disappear under
anaesthesia. with the lapse of time they not only become exaggerated, but
may become permanent from ankylosis or from contracture of the soft
parts round the joint.

_startings at night_ are to be regarded as an indication that there is
progressive disease involving the articular surfaces.

_the formation of extra-articular abscess_ may take place early, or it
may not occur till long after the disease has subsided. the abscess may
develop so insidiously that it does not attract attention until it has
attained considerable size, especially when associated with disease of
the spine, pelvis, or hip. the position of the abscess in relation to
different joints is fairly constant and is determined by the anatomical
relationships of the capsule and synovial membrane to the surrounding
tissues. the bursae and tendon sheaths in the vicinity may influence the
direction of spread of the abscess and the situation of resulting
sinuses. when the abscess is allowed to burst, or is opened and becomes
infected with pyogenic bacteria, there is not only the risk of
aggravation of the disease and persistent suppuration, but there is a
greater liability to general tuberculosis.

the sinuses may be so tortuous that a probe cannot be passed to the
primary focus of disease, and their course and disposition can only be
demonstrated by injecting the sinuses with an emulsion of bismuth and
taking x-ray photographs.

tuberculous infection of the lymph glands of the limb is exceptional,
but may follow upon infection of the skin around the orifice of a sinus.

a slight rise of temperature in the evening may be induced in quiescent
joint lesions by injury or by movement of the joint under anaesthesia, or
by the fatigue of a railway journey. when sinuses have formed and become
infected with pyogenic bacteria, there may be a diurnal variation in the
temperature of the type known as hectic fever (fig. 11).

_relative frequency of tuberculous disease in different
joints._--hospital statistics show that joints are affected in the
following order of frequency: spine, knee, hip, ankle and tarsus, elbow,
wrist, shoulder. the hip and spine are most often affected in childhood
and youth, the shoulder and wrist in adults; the knee, ankle, and elbow
show little age preference.

_clinical variations of tuberculous joint disease._--the above
description applies to tuberculous joint disease in general; it must be
modified to include special manifestations or varieties.

when the main incidence of the infection affects the synovial membrane,
the clinical picture may assume the form of a _hydrops_, or of an
_empyema_ in which the joint is filled with pus. more common than either
of these is the well-known _white swelling_ or _tumor albus_ (wiseman,
1676) which is the clinical manifestation of diffuse thickening of the
synovial membrane along with mucoid degeneration of the peri-synovial
cellular tissue. it is well seen in joints which are superficial--such
as the knee, ankle, elbow, and wrist. the swelling, which is the first
and most prominent clinical feature, develops gradually and painlessly,
obliterating the bony prominences by filling up the natural hollows. it
appears greater to the eye than is borne out by measurement, being
thrown into relief by the wasting of the muscles above and below the
joint. in the early stage the swelling is elastic, doughy, and
non-sensitive, and corresponds to the superficial area of the synovial
membrane involved, and there is comparatively little complaint on the
part of the patient, because the articular surfaces and ligaments are
still intact. there may be a feeling of weight in the limb, and in the
case of the knee and ankle the patient tires on walking and drags the
leg with more or less of a limp. movements of the joint are permitted,
but are limited in range. the disability is increased by use and
exertion, but, for a time at least, it improves under rest.

if the disease is not arrested, there follow the symptoms and signs of
involvement of the articular surfaces.

_influence of tuberculous joint disease on the general
health._--experience shows that the early stages of tuberculous joint
disease are compatible with the appearance of good health. as a rule,
however, and especially if there is mixed infection, the health suffers,
the appetite is impaired, the patient is easily tired, and there may be
some loss of weight.

#treatment.#--in addition to the general treatment of tuberculosis,
local measures are employed. these may be described under two heads--the
conservative and the operative.

_conservative treatment_ is almost always to be employed in the first
instance, as by it a larger proportion of cures is obtained with a
smaller mortality and with better functional results than by operation.

_treatment by rest_ implies the immobilisation of the diseased limb
until pain and tenderness have disappeared. the attitude in which the
limb is immobilised should be that in which, in the event of subsequent
stiffness, it will be most serviceable to the patient. immobilisation
may be secured by bandages, splints, extension, or other apparatus.
_extension_ with weight and pulley is of value in securing rest,
especially in disease of the hip or knee; it eliminates muscular spasm,
relieves pain and startings at night, and prevents abnormal attitudes of
the limb. if, when the patient first comes under observation, the limb
is in a deformed attitude which does not readily yield to extension, the
deformity should be corrected under an anaesthetic.

_the induction of hyperaemia_ is often helpful, the rubber bandage or the
hot-air chamber being employed for an hour or so morning and evening.

_injection of iodoform._--this is carried out on the same lines as have
been described for tuberculous abscess. after the fluid contents of the
joint are withdrawn, the iodoform is injected; and this may require to
be repeated in a month or six weeks.

after the injection of iodoform there is usually considerable reaction,
attended with fever (101 o f.), headache, and malaise, and considerable
pain and swelling of the joint. in some cases there is sickness, and
there may be blood pigment in the urine. the severity of these phenomena
diminishes with each subsequent injection.

the use of scott's dressing and of blisters and of the actual cautery
has largely gone out of fashion, but the cautery may still be employed
with benefit for the relief of pain in cases in which ulceration of
cartilage is a prominent feature.

the application of the x-rays has proved beneficial in synovial lesions
in superficial joints such as the wrist or elbow; prolonged exposures
are made at fortnightly intervals, and on account of the cicatricial
contraction which attends upon recovery, the joint must be kept in good
position.

conservative treatment is only abandoned if improvement does not show
itself after a thorough trial, or if the disease relapses after apparent
cure.

_operative treatment._--other things being equal, operation is more
often indicated in adults than in children, because after the age of
twenty there is less prospect of recovery under conservative treatment,
there is more tendency for the disease to relapse and to invade the
internal organs, and there is no fear of interfering with the growth of
the bones. the state of the general health may necessitate operation as
the most rapid method of removing the disease. the social status of the
patient must also be taken into account; the bread-winner, under
existing social conditions, may be unable to give up his work for a
sufficient time to give conservative measures a fair trial.

the _local conditions_ which decide for or against operation are
differently regarded by different surgeons, but it may be said in
general terms that operative interference is indicated in cases in which
the disease continues to progress in spite of a fair trial of
conservative measures; in cases unsuited for conservative
treatment--that is to say, where there are severe bone lesions.
operative interference is indicated also when the functional result will
be better than that likely to be obtained by conservative measures, as
is often the case in the knee and elbow. cold abscesses should, if
possible, be dealt with before operating on the joint.

in many cases the extent of the operation can only be decided after
exploration. the aim is to remove all the disease with the least
impairment of function and the minimum sacrifice of healthy tissue. the
more open the method of operating the better, so that all parts of the
joint may be available for inspection. the methods of kocher, which
permit of dislocating the joint, are specially to be recommended, as
this procedure affords the freest possible access. diseased synovial
membrane is removed with the scissors or knife. if the cartilages are
sound, and if a movable joint is aimed at, they may be left; but if
ankylosis is desired, they must be removed. localised disease of the
cartilage should be removed with the spoon or gouge, and the bone
beneath investigated. if the articular surface is extensively diseased,
a thin slice of bone should be removed, and if foci in the marrow are
then revealed, it is better to gouge them out than to remove further
slices of bone, as this involves sacrifice of the cortex and periosteum.

operative treatment of deformities resulting from tuberculous joint
disease has almost entirely replaced reduction by force; the contracted
soft parts are divided, and the bone is resected.

_amputation_ for tuberculous joint disease has become one of the rare
operations of surgery, and is only justified when less radical measures
have failed and the condition of the limb is affecting the general
health. amputation is more frequently called for in persons past middle
life who are the subjects of pulmonary tuberculosis.


syphilitic disease

syphilitic affections of joints are comparatively rare. as in
tuberculosis, the disease may be first located in the synovial membrane,
or it may spread to the joint from one of the bones.

in #acquired syphilis#, at an early stage and before the skin eruptions
appear, one of the large joints, such as the shoulder or knee, may be
the seat of pain--_arthralgia_--which is worse at night. in the
secondary stage, a _synovitis_ with serous effusion is not uncommon, and
may affect several joints. syphilitic _hydrops_ is met with almost
exclusively in the knee; it is frequently bilateral, and is insidious in
its onset and progress, the patient usually being able to go about.

in the _tertiary stage_ the joint lesions are persistent and
destructive, and result from the formation of gummata, either in the
deeper layers of the synovial membrane or in the adjacent bone or
periosteum.

_peri-synovial_ and _peri-bursal gummata_ are met with in relation to
the knee-joint of middle-aged adults, especially women. they are usually
multiple, develop slowly, and are rarely sensitive or painful. one or
more of the gummata may break down and give rise to tertiary ulcers. the
co-existence of indolent swellings, ulcers, and depressed scars in the
vicinity of the knee is characteristic of tertiary syphilis.

the disease spreads throughout the capsule and synovial membrane, which
becomes diffusely thickened and infiltrated with granulation tissue
which eats into and replaces the articular cartilage. clinically, the
condition resembles tuberculous disease of the synovial membrane, for
which it is probably frequently mistaken, but in the syphilitic
affection the swelling is nodular and uneven, and the subjective
symptoms are slight, mobility is little impaired, and yet the deformity
is considerable.

_syphilitic osteo-arthritis_ results from a gumma in the periosteum or
marrow of one of the adjacent bones. there is gradual enlargement of one
of the bones, the patient complains of pains, which are worst at night.
the disease may extend to the synovial membrane and be attended with
effusion into the joint, or it may erupt on the periosteal surface and
invade the skin, forming one or more sinuses. the further progress is
complicated by the occurrence of pyogenic infection leading to necrosis
of bone, in the knee-joint, for example, the patella or one of the
condyles of the femur or tibia, may furnish a sequestrum. in such cases,
anti-syphilitic treatment must be supplemented by operation for the
removal of the diseased tissues. in the knee, excision is rarely
necessary; but in the elbow it may be called for to obtain a movable
joint.

in #inherited syphilis# the earliest joint affections are those in which
there is an effusion into the joint, especially the knee or elbow; and
in exceptional cases pyogenic infection may be superadded, and pus form
in the joint.

in older children, a gummatous synovitis is met with of which the most
striking features are: its insidious development, its chronic course,
symmetrical distribution, freedom from pain, the free mobility of the
joint, its tendency to relapse, and its association with other
syphilitic stigmata, especially in the eyes. the knees are the joints
most frequently affected, and the condition usually yields readily to
anti-syphilitic treatment without impairment of function.


joint diseases accompanying certain constitutional conditions

#gout.#--_arthritis urica._--one of the manifestations of gout is that
certain joints are liable to attacks of inflammation associated with the
deposit of a chalk-like material composed of sodium biurate, chiefly in
the matrix of the articular cartilage, it may be in streaks or patches
towards the central area of the joint, or throughout the entire extent
of the cartilage, which appears as if it had been painted over with
plaster of paris. as a result of this uratic infiltration, the cartilage
loses its vitality and crumbles away, leading to the formation of what
are known as gouty ulcers, and these may extend through the cartilage
and invade the bone. the deposit of urates in the synovial membrane is
attended with effusion into the joint and the formation of adhesions,
while in the ligaments and peri-articular structures it leads to the
formation of scar tissue. the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the great
toe, on one or on both sides, is that most frequently affected. the
disease is met with in men after middle life, and while common enough in
england and ireland, is almost unknown in hospital practice in scotland.

the _clinical features_ are characteristic. there is a sudden onset of
excruciating pain, usually during the early hours of the morning, the
joint becomes swollen, red, and glistening, with engorgement of the
veins and some fever and disturbance of health and temper. in the course
of a week or ten days there is a gradual return to the normal. such
attacks may recur only once a year or they may be more frequent; the
successive attacks tend to become less acute but last longer, and the
local phenomena persist, the joint remaining permanently swollen and
stiff. masses of chalk form in and around the joint, and those in the
subcutaneous tissue may break through the skin, forming indolent ulcers
with exposure of the chalky masses (_tophi_). the hands may become
seriously crippled, especially when the tendon sheaths and bursae also
are affected; the crippling resembles that resulting from arthritis
deformans but it differs in not being symmetrical.

the local _treatment_ consists in employing soothing applications and a
bier's bandage for two or three hours twice daily while the symptoms are
acute; later, hot-air baths, massage, and exercises are indicated. it is
remarkable how completely even the most deformed joints may recover
their function. dietetic and medicinal treatment must also be employed.

#chronic rheumatism.#--this term is applied to a condition which
sometimes follows upon acute articular rheumatism in persons presenting
a family tendency to acute rheumatism or to inflammations of serous
membranes, and manifesting other evidence of the rheumatic taint, such
as chorea or rheumatic nodules.

the changes in the joints involve almost exclusively the synovial
membrane and the ligaments; they consist in cellular infiltration and
exudation, resulting in the formation of new connective tissue which
encroaches on the cavity of the joint and gives rise to adhesions, and
by contracting causes stiffness and deformity. the articular cartilages
may subsequently be transformed into connective tissue, with consequent
fibrous ankylosis and obliteration of the joint. the bones are affected
only in so far as they undergo fatty atrophy from disuse of the limb, or
alteration in their configuration as a result of partial dislocation.
osseous ankylosis may occur, especially in the small joints of the hand
and foot.

the disease is generally poly-articular and may be met with in childhood
and youth as well as in adult life. in some cases pain is so severe that
the patient resists the least attempt at movement. in others, the
joints, although stiff, can be moved but exhibit pronounced crackings.
when there is much connective tissue formed in relation to the synovial
membrane, the joint is swollen, and as the muscles waste above and
below, the swelling is spindle-shaped. subacute exacerbations occur from
time to time, with fever and aggravation of the local symptoms and
implication of other joints. after repeated recurrences, there is
ankylosis with deformity, the patient becoming a helpless cripple. on
account of the tendency to visceral complications, the tenure of life is
uncertain.

from the nature of the disease, _treatment_ is for the most part
palliative. salicylates are only of service during the exacerbations
attended with pyrexia. the application of soda fomentations, turpentine
cloths, or electric or hot-air baths may be useful. improvement may
result from the general and local therapeutics available at such places
as bath, buxton, harrogate, strathpeffer, wiesbaden, or aix. in selected
cases, a certain measure of success has followed operative interference,
which consists in a modified excision. the deformities resulting from
chronic rheumatism are but little amenable to surgical treatment, and
forcible attempts to remedy stiffness or deformity are to be avoided.

#arthritis deformans# (_osteo-arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic
gout, malum senile, traumatic or mechanical arthritis_).--under the term
arthritis deformans, which was first employed by virchow, it is
convenient to include a number of joint affections which have many
anatomical and clinical features in common.

the disease is widely distributed in the animal kingdom, both in
domestic species and in wild animals in the natural state such as the
larger carnivora and the gorilla; evidence of it has also been found in
the bones of animals buried with prehistoric man.

the morbid changes in the joints present a remarkable combination of
atrophy and degeneration on the one hand and overgrowth on the other,
indicating a profound disturbance of nutrition in the joint structures.
the nature of this disturbance and its etiology are imperfectly known.
by many writers it is believed to depend upon some form of
auto-intoxication, the toxins being absorbed from the gastro-intestinal
tract, and those who suffer are supposed to possess what has been called
an "arthritic diathesis."

the localisation of the disease in a particular joint may be determined
by several factors, of which trauma appears to be the most important.
the condition is frequently observed to follow, either directly or after
an interval, upon a lesion which involves gross injury of the joint or
of one of the neighbouring bones. it occurs with greater frequency after
repeated minor injuries affecting the joint and its vicinity, such as
sprains and contusions, and particularly those sustained in laborious
occupations. this connection between trauma and arthritis deformans led
arbuthnot lane to apply to it the term _traumatic_ or _trade arthritis_.

the traumatic or strain factor in the production of the disease may be
manifested in a less obvious fashion. in the lower extremity, for
example, _any condition which disturbs the static equilibrium of the
limb as a whole_ would appear to predispose to the disease in one or
other of the joints. the static equilibrium may be disturbed by such
deformities as flat-foot or knock-knee, and badly united fractures of
the lower extremity. in hallux valgus, the metatarso-phalangeal joint of
the great toe undergoes changes characteristic of arthritis deformans.

a number of cases have been recorded in which arthritis deformans has
followed upon antecedent disease of the joint, such as pyogenic or
gonorrhoeal synovitis, upon repeated haemorrhages into the knee-joint in
bleeders, and in unreduced dislocations in which a new joint has been
established.

[illustration: fig. 157.--arthritis deformans of elbow, showing
destruction of articular surfaces and masses of new bone around the
articular margins.

(anatomical museum, university of edinburgh.)]

lastly, poncet and other members of the lyons school regard arthritis
deformans as due to an attenuated form of tuberculous infection, and
draw attention to the fact that a tuberculous family history is often
met with in the subjects of the disease.

[illustration: fig. 158.--arthritis deformans of knee, showing
eburnation and grooving of articular surfaces.

(anatomical museum, university of edinburgh.)]

_morbid anatomy._--the commonest type is that in which the articular
surfaces undergo degenerative changes. the primary change involves the
articular cartilage, which becomes softened and fibrillated and is worn
away until the subjacent bone is exposed. if the bone is rarefied, the
enlarged cancellous spaces are opened into and an eroded and worm-eaten
appearance is brought about; with further use of the joint, the bone is
worn away, so that in a ball-and-socket joint like the hip, the head of
the femur and the acetabulum are markedly altered in size and shape.
more commonly, the bone exposed as a result of disappearance of the
cartilage is denser than normal, and under the influence of the
movements of the joint, becomes smooth and polished--a change described
as _eburnation_ of the articular surfaces (fig. 158). in hinge-joints
such as the knee and elbow, the influence of movement is shown by a
series of parallel grooves corresponding to the lines of friction
(fig. 158).

[illustration: fig. 159.--hypertrophied fringes of synovial membrane in
arthritis deformans of knee.

(museum of royal college of surgeons, edinburgh.)]

while these degenerative changes are gradually causing destruction of
the articular surfaces, reparative and hypertrophic changes are taking
place at the periphery. along the line of the junction between the
cartilage and synovial membrane, the proliferation of tissue leads to
the formation of nodules or masses of cartilage--_ecchondroses_--which
are subsequently converted into bone (fig. 157). gross alterations in
the ends of the bone are thus brought about which can be recognised
clinically and in skiagrams, and which tend to restrict the normal range
of movement. the extension of the ossification into the synovial
reflection and capsular ligament adds a collar or "lip" of new bone,
known as "lipping" of the articular margins, and also into other
ligaments, insertions of tendons and intermuscular septa giving rise to
bony outgrowths or osteophytes not unlike those met with in the
neuro-arthropathies.

proliferative changes in the synovial membrane are attended with
increased vascularity and thickening of the membrane and an enlargement
of its villi and fringes. when the fatty fringes are developed to an
exaggerated degree, the condition is described as an _arborescent
lipoma_ (fig. 159). individual fringes may attain the size of a hazel
nut, and the fibro-fatty tissue of which they are composed may be
converted into cartilage and bone; such a body may remain attached by a
narrow pedicle or stalk, or this may be torn across and the body becomes
loose and, unless confined in a recess of the joint, it wanders about
and may become impacted between the articular surfaces. these changes in
the synovial membrane are often associated with an abundant exudate or
hydrops. these degenerative and hypertrophic changes, while usually
attended with marked restriction of movement and sometimes by "locking"
of the joint, practically never result in ankylosis.

the _ankylosing type_ of chronic arthritis is fortunately much rarer
than those described above, and is chiefly met with in the joints of the
fingers and toes and in those of the vertebral column. the synovial
membrane proliferates, grows over the cartilage, and replaces it, and
when two such articular surfaces are in contact they tend to adhere,
thus obliterating the joint, cavity, and resulting in fibrous or bony
ankylosis. the changes progress slowly and, before they result in
ankylosis, various sub-luxations and dislocations may occur with
distortion and deformity which, in the case of the fingers, is extremely
disabling and unsightly (fig. 160).

_clinical features._--it is usually observed that in patients who are
still young the tendency is for the disease to advance with considerable
rapidity, so that in the course of months it may cause crippling of
several joints. the course of the disease as met with in persons past
middle life is more chronic; it begins insidiously, and many years may
pass before there is pronounced disability. the earliest symptom is
stiffness, especially in the morning after rest, which passes off
temporarily with use of the limb. as time goes on, the range of movement
becomes restricted, and crackings occur. this stage of the disease may
be prolonged indefinitely; if it progresses, stiffness becomes more
pronounced, certain movements are lost, others develop in abnormal
directions, and deformed attitudes add to the disablement. the disease
is compatible with long life, but not with any active occupation, hence
those of the hospital class who suffer from it tend to accumulate in
workhouse infirmaries.

_hydrops_ is most marked in the knee, and may affect also the adjacent
bursae. as the joint becomes distended with fluid, the ligaments are
stretched, the limb becomes weak and unstable, and the patient complains
of a feeling of weight, of insecurity, and of tiredness. pain is
occasional and evanescent, and is usually the result of some extra
exertion, or exposure to cold and wet. this form of the disease is
extremely chronic, and may last for an indefinite number of years. it is
to be diagnosed from the other forms of hydrops already considered--the
purely traumatic, the pyogenic, gonorrhoeal, tuberculous, and
syphilitic--and from that associated with charcot's disease.

_hypertrophied fringes and pedunculated or loose bodies_ often co-exist
with hydrops, and give rise to characteristic clinical features,
particularly in the knee. the fringes, especially when they assume the
type of the arborescent lipoma, project into the cavity of the joint,
filling up its recesses and distending its capsule so that the joint is
swollen and slightly flexed. pain is not a prominent feature, and the
patient may walk fairly well. on grasping the joint while it is being
actively flexed and extended, the fringes may be felt moving under the
fingers. symptoms from impaction of a loose body are exceptional.

[illustration: fig. 160.--arthritis deformans of hands, showing
symmetry of lesions, ulnar deviation of fingers, and nodular thickening
at inter-phalangeal joints.]

_the dry form of arthritis deformans_, although specially common in the
knee, is met with in other joints, either as a mon-articular or
poly-articular disease; and it is also met with in the joints of the
spine and of the fingers as well as in the temporo-mandibular joint. in
the joints of the fingers the disease is remarkably symmetrical, and
tends to assume a nodular type (heberden's nodes) (fig. 160); in younger
subjects it assumes a more painful and progressive fusiform type
(fig. 161). in the larger joints the subjective symptoms usually precede

any palpable evidence of disease, the patient complaining of stiffness,
crackings, and aching, aggravated by changes in the weather. the
roughness due to fibrillation of the articular cartilages causes coarse
friction on moving the joint, or, in the knee, on moving the patella on
the condyles of the femur. it may be months or even years before the
lipping and other hypertrophic changes in the ends of the bones are
recognisable, and before the joint assumes the deformed features which
the name of the disease suggests.

the capsular ligament, except in hydrops, is the seat of
connective-tissue overgrowth, and tends to become contracted and rigid.
intra-articular ligaments, such as the ligamentum teres in the hip, are
usually worn away and disappear. the surrounding muscles undergo
atrophy, tendons become adherent to their sheaths and may be ossified,
and the sheaths of nerves may be involved by the cicatricial changes in
the surrounding tissues.

_the x-ray appearances of arthritis deformans_ necessarily vary with the
type of the disease and the joint affected; in the joints of the fingers
there is a narrowing of the spaces between the articular ends of the
bones as a result of absorption of the articular cartilage, and
rarefaction of the cancellous tissue in the vicinity of the joints; in
the larger joints there is "lipping" of the articular margins,
osteophytes, and other evidence of abnormal ossification in and around
the joint. eburnation of the articular surfaces is shown by increase in
the density of the shadow of the bone in the areas affected.

[illustration: fig. 161.--arthritis deformans affecting several
joints, in a boy aet. 10.

(dr. dickson's case.)]

_treatment._--treatment is for the most part limited to the relief of
symptoms. on no account should the affected joints be kept at rest by
means of splints or other apparatus. active movements and exercises of
all kinds are to be persevered with. when pain is a prominent feature,
it may be relieved either by douches of iodine and hot water (tincture
of iodine 1 oz. to the quart), or by the application of lint saturated
with a lotion made up of chloral hydrate, gr. v, glycerin [dram]j, water
[ounce]j, and covered with oil-silk. strain and over-use of the joint
and sudden changes of temperature are to be avoided. the induction of
hyperaemia by means of massage, the elastic bandage, and hot-air baths is
often of service. operative interference is indicated when the disease
is of a severe type, when it is mon-articular, and when the general
condition of the patient is otherwise favourable. excision has been
practised with success in the hip, knee, elbow, and temporo-mandibular
joints. limitation of movement and locking at the hip-joint when due to
new bone round the edge of the acetabulum may be greatly relieved by
removal of the bone--a procedure known as _cheilotomy_. loose bodies and
hypertrophied fringes if causing symptoms may also be removed by
operation.

when stiffness and grating on movement are prominent features we have
found the injection of from half to one ounce of sterilised white
vaseline afford decided relief.

the patient should be nourished well, and there need be no restriction
in the diet such as is required in gouty patients, so long as the
digestion is not impaired. benefit is also derived from the
administration of cod-liver oil, and of tonics, such as strychnin,
arsenic, and iron, and in some cases of iodide of potassium. luff
recommends the administration over long periods of guaiacol carbonate,
in cachets beginning with doses of 5-10 grs. and increased to 15-20 grs.
thrice daily. a course of treatment at one of the reputed spas--aix,
bath, buxton, gastein, harrogate, strathpeffer, wiesbaden, wildbad--is
often beneficial.

in some cases benefit has followed the prolonged internal administration
of liquid paraffin.

on the assumption that the condition is the result of an
auto-intoxication from the intestinal tract, saline purges and
irrigation of the colon are indicated, and arbuthnot lane claims to have
brought about improvement by short-circuiting or by resecting the colon.

residence in a warm and dry climate, with an open-air life, has been
known to arrest the disease when other measures have failed to give
relief.

the application of radium and the ingestion of radio-active waters have
also been recommended.

#haemophilic# or #bleeder's joint#.--this is a rare but characteristic
affection met with chiefly in the knee-joint of boys who are the
subjects of haemophilia. after some trivial injury, or even without
apparent cause, a haemorrhage takes place into the joint. the joint is
tensely swollen, cannot be completely extended, and is so painful that
the patient is obliged to lie up. the temperature is often raised (101 o
to 102 o f.), especially if there are also haemorrhages elsewhere. the
blood in the joint is slowly re-absorbed, and by the end of a fortnight
or so, the symptoms completely disappear. as a rule these attacks are
repeated; the pain attending them diminishes, but the joint becomes the
seat of permanent changes: the synovial membrane is thickened,
abnormally vascular, and coloured brown from the deposit of blood
pigment; on its surface, and in parts of the articular cartilage, there
is a deposit of rust-coloured fibrin; there may be extensive adhesions,
and in some cases changes occur like those observed in arthritis
deformans with erosion and ulceration of the cartilage and a form of dry
caries of the articular surfaces, which may terminate in ankylosis.

as the swelling of the joint is associated with wasting of the muscles,
with stiffness, and with flexion, the condition closely resembles
tuberculous disease of the synovial membrane. from errors in diagnosis
such joints have been operated upon, with disastrous results due to
haemorrhage.

the treatment of a recent haemorrhage consists in securing absolute rest
and applying elastic compression. the introduction of blood-serum (10-15
c.c.) into a vein may assist in arresting the haemorrhage;
anti-diphtheritic serum is that most readily obtainable.

after an interval, measures should be adopted to promote the absorption
of blood and to prevent stiffness and flexion; these include massage,
movements, and extension with weight and pulley.


joint diseases associated with lesions of the nervous system:
neuro-arthropathies

_in lesions of peripheral nerves._--in the hand, and more rarely in the
foot, when one or other of the main nerve-trunks has been divided or
compressed, the joints may become swollen and painful and afterwards
become stiff and deformed. bony ankylosis has been observed.

_in affections of the spinal medulla._--in myelitis, progressive
muscular atrophy, poliomyelitis, insular sclerosis, and in traumatic
lesions, joint affections are occasionally met with.

the occurrence of joint lesions in _locomotor ataxia_ (tabes dorsalis)
was first described by charcot in 1868--hence the term "charcot's
disease" applied to them. although they usually develop in the ataxic
stage, one or more years after the initial spinal symptoms, they may
appear before there is any evidence of tabes. the onset is frequently
determined by some injury. the joints of the lower extremity are most
commonly affected, and the disease is bilateral in a considerable
proportion of cases--both knees or both hips, for instance, being
implicated.

among the theories suggested in explanation of these arthropathies the
most recent is that by babinski and barre, which traces the condition to
vascular lesions of a syphilitic type in the articular arteries.

the first symptom is usually a swelling of the joint and its vicinity.
there is no redness or heat and no pain on movement. the peri-articular
swelling, unlike ordinary oedema, scarcely pits even on firm pressure.

[illustration: fig. 162.--bones of knee-joint in advanced stage of
charcot's disease. the medial part of the head of the tibia has
disappeared.

(anatomical museum, university of edinburgh).]

in mild cases this condition of affairs may persist for months; in
severe cases destructive changes ensue with remarkable rapidity. the
joint becomes enormously swollen, loses its normal contour, and the ends
of the bones become irregularly deformed (fig. 162). sometimes, and
especially in the knee, the clinical features are those of an enormous
hydrops with fibrinous and other loose bodies and hypertrophied
fringes--and great oedema of the peri-articular tissues (fig. 163). the
joint is wobbly or flail-like from stretching and destruction of the
controlling ligaments, and is devoid of sensation. in other cases,
wearing down and total disappearance of the ends of the bones is the
prominent feature, attended with flail-like movements and with coarse
grating. dislocation is observed chiefly at the hip, and is rather a
gross displacement with unnatural mobility than a typical dislocation,
and it is usually possible to move the bones freely upon one another and
to reduce the displacement. a striking feature is the extensive
formation of new bone in the capsular ligament and surrounding muscles.
the enormous swelling and its rapid development may suggest the growth
of a malignant tumour. the most useful factor in diagnosis is the entire
absence of pain, of tenderness, and of common sensibility. the freedom
with which a tabetic patient will allow his disorganised joint to be
handled requires to be seen to be appreciated.

[illustration: fig. 163.--charcot's disease of left knee. the joint is
distended with fluid and the whole limb is oedematous.]

the rapidity of the destructive changes in certain cases of tabes, and
the entire absence of joint lesions in others, would favour the view
that special parts of the spinal medulla must be implicated in the
former group.

in _syringomyelia_, joint affections (gliomatous arthropathies) are more
frequent than in tabes, and they usually involve the upper extremity in
correspondence with the seat of the spinal lesion, which usually affects
the lower cervical and upper thoracic segments. except that the joint
disease is seldom symmetrical, it closely resembles the arthropathy of
tabes. the completeness of the analgesia of the articular structures
and of the overlying soft parts is illustrated by the fact that in one
case the patient himself was in the habit of letting out the fluid from
his elbow with the aid of a pair of scissors, and that in another the
joint was painlessly excised without an anaesthetic.

[illustration: fig. 164.--charcot's disease of both ankles: front view.
man, aet. 32.]

the disease may become arrested or may go on to complete
disorganisation; suppuration may ensue from infection through a breach
of the surface, and in rare cases the joint has become the seat of
tuberculosis.

[illustration: fig. 165.--charcot's disease of both ankles: back view.
man, aet. 32.]

_treatment_, in addition to that of the nerve lesion underlying the
arthropathy, consists in supporting and protecting the joint by means of
bandages, splints, and other apparatus. in the lower extremity, the use
of crutches is helpful in taking the strain off the affected limb. when
there is much distension of the joint, considerable relief follows upon
withdrawal of fluid. the best possible result being rigid ankylosis in a
good position, it may be advisable to bring this about artificially by
arthrodesis or resection. operation is indicated when only one joint is
affected and when the cord lesion is such as will permit of the patient
using the limb. the wounds heal well, but the victims of tabes are
unfavourable subjects for operative interference, on account of their
liability to intercurrent complications. when the limb is quite useless,
amputation may be the best course.

_in cerebral lesions_ attended with hemiplegia, joint affections,
characterised by evanescent pain, redness, and swelling, are
occasionally met with. the secondary changes in joints which are the
seat of paralytic contracture are considered with the surgery of the
extremities.

in cases of _hysteria_ and other _functional affections of the
nervous system_, an intermittent neuropathic hydrops has been
observed--especially in the knee. without apparent cause, the joint
fills with fluid and its movements become restricted, and after from two
to eight days the swelling subsides and the joint returns to normal. a
remarkable feature of the condition is that the effusion into the joint
recurs at regular intervals, it may be over a period of years. psychic
conditions have been known to induce attacks, and sometimes to abort
them or even to cause their disappearance. hence it has been recommended
that treatment by suggestion should be employed along with tonic doses
of quinine and arsenic.


hysterical or mimetic joint affections

under this heading, sir benjamin brodie, in 1822, described an affection
of joints, characterised by the prominence of subjective symptoms and
the absence of pathological changes. although most frequently met with
in young women with an impressionable nervous system, and especially
among those in good social circumstances, it occurs occasionally in men.
the onset may be referred to injury or exposure to cold, or may be
associated with some disturbance of the emotions or of the generative
organs; or the condition may be an involuntary imitation of the symptoms
of organic joint disease presented by a relative or friend.

it is characteristic that the symptoms develop abruptly without
satisfactory cause, that they are exaggerated and wanting in harmony
with one another, and that they do not correspond with the features of
any of the known forms of organic disease. in some cases the only
complaint is of severe pain; more often this is associated with
excessive tenderness and with impairment of the functions of the joint.
on examination the joint presents a normal appearance, but the skin
over it is remarkably sensitive. a light touch is more likely to excite
pain than deep and firm pressure. stiffness is a variable feature--in
some cases amounting to absolute rigidity, so that no ordinary force
will elicit movement. it is characteristic of this, as of other
neuroses, that the symptoms come and go without sufficient cause. when
the patient's attention is diverted, the pain and stiffness may
disappear. there is no actual swelling of the joint, although there may
be an appearance of this from wasting of the muscles above and below. if
the joint is kept rigid for long periods, secondary contracture may
occur--in the knee with flexion, in the hip with flexion and adduction.

the _diagnosis_ is often a matter of considerable difficulty, and the
condition is liable to be mistaken for such organic lesions as a
tuberculous or pyogenic focus in the bone close to the joint.

the greatest difficulty is met with in the knee and hip, where the
condition may closely simulate tuberculous disease. the use of the
rontgen rays, or examination of the joint under anaesthesia, is helpful.

the _local treatment_ consists chiefly in improving the nutrition of the
affected limb by means of massage, exercises, baths, and electricity.
splints are to be avoided. in refractory cases, benefit may follow the
application of blisters or of corrigan's button. the general condition
of the patient must be treated on the same lines as in other neuroses.
the weir-mitchell treatment may have to be employed in obstinate cases,
the patient being secluded from her friends and placed in charge of a
nurse. complete recovery is the rule, but when the muscles are weak and
wasted from prolonged disuse, a considerable time may elapse before the
limb returns to normal.


tumours and cysts

new growths taking origin in the synovial membrane are rare, and are not
usually diagnosed before operation. they are attended with exudation
into the joint, and in the case of _sarcoma_ the fluid is usually
blood-stained. if the tumour projects in a polypoidal manner into the
joint, it may cause symptoms of loose body. one or two cases have been
recorded in which a _cartilaginous tumour_ growing from the synovial
membrane has erupted through the joint capsule and infiltrated the
adjoining muscles. _multiple cartilaginous tumours_ forming loose bodies
are described on p. 544.

_cysts of joints_ constitute an ill-defined group which includes ganglia
formed in relation to the capsular ligament. cystic distension of bursae
which communicate with the joint is most often met with in the region of
the knee in cases of long-standing hydrops. it was suggested by morrant
baker that cystic swellings may result from the hernial protrusion of
the synovial membrane between the stretched fibres of the capsular
ligament, and the name "baker's cysts" has been applied to these.

in the majority of cases, cysts in relation to joints give rise to
little inconvenience and may be left alone. if interfered with at all,
they should be excised.


loose bodies

it is convenient to describe the varieties of loose bodies under two
heads: those composed of fibrin, and those composed of organised
connective tissue.

#fibrinous loose bodies# (corpora oryzoidea).--these are homogeneous or
concentrically laminated masses of fibrin, sometimes resembling rice
grains, melon seeds, or adhesive wafers, sometimes quite irregular in
shape. usually they are present in large numbers, but sometimes there is
only one, and it may attain considerable dimensions. they are not
peculiar to joints, for they are met with in tendon sheaths and bursae,
and their origin from synovial membrane may be accepted as proved. they
occur in tuberculosis, arthritis deformans, and in charcot's disease,
and their presence is almost invariably associated with an effusion of
fluid into the joint. while they may result from the coagulation of
fibrin-forming elements in the exudate, their occurrence in tuberculous
hydrops would appear to be the result of coagulation necrosis, or of
fibrinous degeneration of the surface layer of the diseased synovial
membrane. however formed, their shape is the result of mechanical
influences, and especially of the movement of the joint.

_clinically_, loose bodies composed of fibrin constitute an unimportant
addition to the features of the disease with which they are associated.
they never give rise to the classical symptoms associated with impaction
of a loose body between the articular surfaces. their presence may be
recognised, especially in the knee, by the crepitating sensation
imparted to the fingers of the hand grasping the joint while it is
flexed and extended by the patient.

the _treatment_ is directed towards the disease underlying the hydrops.
if it is desired to empty the joint, this is best done by open
incision.

[illustration: fig. 166.--radiogram of multiple loose bodies in
knee-joint and semi-membranosus bursa in a man aet. 38.

(mr. j. w. dowden's case.)]

#bodies composed of organised connective tissue.#--these are
comparatively common in joints that are already the seat of some chronic
disease, such as arthritis deformans, charcot's arthropathy, or synovial
tuberculosis. they take origin almost exclusively from an erratic
overgrowth of the fringes of the synovial membrane, and may consist
entirely of fat, the arborescent lipoma (fig. 159) being the most
pronounced example of this variety. fibrous tissue or cartilage may
form in one or more of the fatty fringes and give rise to hard nodular
masses, which may attain a considerable size, and in course of time may
undergo ossification.

like other hypertrophies on a free surface, they tend to become
pedunculated, and so acquire a limited range of movement. the pedicle
may give way and the body become free. in this condition it may wander
about the joint, or lie snugly in one of its recesses until disturbed by
some sudden movement. a loose body free in a joint is capable of growth,
deriving the necessary nutriment from the surrounding fluid. the size
and number of the bodies vary widely. single specimens have been known
to attain the size of the patella. the smaller varieties may number
considerably over a hundred.

[illustration: fig. 167.--loose body from knee-joint of man aet. 25.
natural size.

a = convex surface.   b = concave surface.]

in arthritis deformans a rarer type of loose body is met with, a portion
of the lipping of one of the articular margins being detached by injury.
in charcot's disease, bodies composed of bone are formed in relation to
the capsular and other ligaments, and may be made to grate upon one
another.

the _clinical features_ in this group are mainly those of the disease
which has given rise to the loose bodies, and it is exceptional to meet
with symptoms from impaction of the body between the articular surfaces.
treatment is to be directed towards the primary disease in the joint, as
well as to the removal of the loose bodies.

[illustration: fig. 168.--multiple partially ossified chondromas of
synovial membrane, from shoulder-joint, the seat of arthritis deformans,
from a man aet. 35.]

_loose bodies in joints which are otherwise healthy._--it is in joints
otherwise healthy that loose bodies causing the classical symptoms and
calling for operative treatment are most frequently met with. they occur
chiefly in the knee and elbow of healthy males under the age of thirty.
the complaint may be of vague pains, of occasional cracking on moving
the joint, or of impairment of function--usually an inability to extend
or flex the joint completely. in many cases a clear account is given of
the symptoms which arise when the body is impacted between the articular
surfaces, namely, sudden onset of intense sickening pain, loss of power
in the limb and locking of the joint, followed by effusion and other
accompaniments of a severe sprain. on some particular movement, the
body is disengaged, the locking disappears, and recovery takes place.
attacks of this kind may recur at irregular intervals, during a period
of many years. on examining the joint, it is usually found to contain
fluid, and there may be points of special tenderness corresponding to
the ligaments that have been overstretched. in cases in which there has
been recurrent attacks of locking, the ligaments become slack, the joint
is wobbly, and the quadriceps is wasted. the patient himself, or the
surgeon, may discover the loose body and feel it roll beneath his
fingers, especially if it is lodged in the supra-patellar pouch in the
knee, or on one or other side of the olecranon in the elbow. in most
instances the patient has carefully observed his own symptoms, and is
aware not only of the existence of the loose body, but of its erratic
appearance at different parts of the joint. this feature serves to
differentiate the lesions from a torn medial meniscus in which the pain
and tenderness are always in the same spot. as the body usually contains
bone, it is recognisable in a skiagram.

[illustration: fig. 169.--multiple cartilaginous loose bodies from
knee-joint.]

there are two methods of _removing the body_; the first and simpler
method is applicable when the body can be palpated, usually in the
supra-patellar pouch; it is preferably transfixed by a needle and can
then be removed through a small incision; otherwise, the joint must be
freely opened and explored, firstly to find the body and further to
remove it.

the characters of this type of loose body are remarkably constant. it is
usually solitary, about the size of a bean or almond, concavo-convex in
shape, the convex aspect being smooth like an articular surface, the
concave aspect uneven and nodulated and showing reparative changes,
healing over of the raw surface, and the new formation of fibrous
tissue, hyaline cartilage and bone, the necessary nutriment being
derived from the synovial fluid (fig. 167). the body is sometimes found
to be lodged in a defect or excavation in one of the articular surfaces,
usually the medial condyle of the femur, from which it is readily
shelled out by means of an elevator. it presents on section a layer of
articular cartilage on the convex aspect and a variable thickness of
spongy bone beneath this.

the origin of these bodies is one of the most debated questions in
surgical pathology; they obviously consist of a portion of the articular
surface of one of the bones, but how this is detached still remains a
mystery; some maintain that it is purely traumatic; konig regards them
as portions of the articular surface which have been detached by a
morbid process which he calls "osteochondritis dessicans."

_multiple chondromas and osteomas of the synovial membrane._--in this
rare type of loose body, the surface of the synovial membrane is studded
with small sessile or pedunculated tumours composed of pure hyaline
cartilage, or of bone, or of transition stages between cartilage and
bone. they are pearly white in colour, pitted and nodular on the
surface, rarely larger than a pea, although when compressed they may
cake into masses of considerable size. with the movements of the joint
many of the tumours become detached and lie in the serous exudate
excited by their presence. they are found also in the diverticula of the
synovial membrane, in the shoulder in the downward prolongation along
the tendon of the biceps, in the hip in the bursal extension beneath the
psoas.

the patient complains of increasing disability of the limb, movements of
the joint becoming more and more restricted and painful. there is
swelling corresponding to the distended capsule of the joint, and on
palpation the bodies moving under the fingers yield a sensation as of
grains of rice shifting in a bag. if the bodies are so numerous as to be
tightly packed together, the impression is that of a plastic mass having
the shape of the synovial sac. the stiffness and the cracking on
movement may suggest arthritis deformans, but the x-ray appearances make
the diagnosis an easy one. we have observed two cases of this affection
in the knee-joint of adult women, one in the shoulder-joint of an adult
male (fig. 168), and caird has observed one in the hip. the treatment
consists in opening the joint by free incision and removing the bodies.

_displacement of the menisci_ of the knee is referred to with injuries
of that joint.
